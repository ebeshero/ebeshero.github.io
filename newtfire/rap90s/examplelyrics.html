         <br /> My attitude was "<span class="profanity">fuck</span> it," because <span
            class="profanity">motherfuckers</span> love it <br /> To be a soldier, must maintain
         composure at ease <br /> Though life is complicated, only what you make it to be <br /> Uh,
         and my ambitions as a ridah <br /> To catch her while she hot and horny, go up inside her
         <br /> Then I spit some game in her ear, "Go to the telly, <span class="dt">hoe</span>!"
         <br /> Equipped with money in a Benz ‘cause, <span class="profanity">bitch</span>, I'm
         barely broke <br /> I'm smokin' <span class="profanity">bomb-ass</span> weed, feelin'
         crucial <br /> From player to player the game's tight, the feeling's mutual <br /> From
         hustlin' and prayers to breakin' <span class="profanity">motherfuckers</span> to pay up
         <br /> I got no time for these <span class="profanity">bitches</span>, ‘cause these <span
            class="dt">hoes</span> try to play us <br /> I'm on a meal ticket mission, want a mill,
         so I'm wishin' <br /> Competition got me ripped on that <span class="profanity"
            >bullshit</span> they stressin' <br /> I'ma rhyme though, clown hoes like it's mandatory
         <br /> No guts, no glory, my <span class="profanity">nigga</span>, <span class="profanity"
            >bitch</span> got the game distorted <br /> Now it's on and it's on because I said so
         <br /> Can't trust a <span class="profanity">bitch</span> in the business, <span
            class="lifeEvent">so I got with Death Row</span>
         <br /> Now these money-hungry bitches gettin' suspicious <br /> Started plottin' and
         plannin' on schemes to come and trick us <br /> But thug niggas be on point and game tight
         <br /> Me, Syke and Bogart strapped up the same night <br /> Got problems, then handle it,
            <span class="profanity">motherfuckers</span> see me <br /> These <span class="profanity"
            >niggas</span> is <span class="emotion">jealous</span>
         <br /> ‘Cause deep in they heart they wanna be me <br /> Uh, yeah, and now you got me right
         beside ya, hopin' you listen <br /> I catch you payin' attention to my ambitions as a ridah <br />
         <br />
         <br /> I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah <br /> You don't wanna <span class="profanity"
            >fuck</span> with me <br /> Got the police bustin' at me <br /> But they can't do
         nothin' to a G <br /> Let's get ready to rumble <br />
         <br />
         <br /> It was my only wish to rise <br /> Above these <span class="emotion">jealous</span>
         coward <span class="profanity">motherfuckers</span> I despise <br /> When it's time to ride
         I was the first off this side, give me the 9 <br /> I'm ready to die right here tonight and
            <span class="profanity">motherfuck</span> they life <br /> That's what they screamin' as
         they drill me, but I'm hard to kill <br /> (That's all you <span class="profanity"
            >niggas</span> got?!) <br /> So open fire, I see you kill me, witness my steel <br />
         Spittin' at adversaries, <span class="emotion">envious</span> and after me <br /> I'd
         rather die before they capture me, watch me bleed <br /> Mama, come rescue me, I'm
         suicidal, thinkin' thoughts <br /> I'm innocent, so there'll be bullets flyin' when I'm
         caught <br /> (Shoot!) <span class="profanity">Fuck</span> doin' jail time, better day,
         sacrificin' <br /> Won't get a chance to do me like they did my <span class="profanity"
            >nigga</span> Tyson <br /> Thuggin' for life, and if you right, then <span
            class="profanity">nigga</span> die for it <br /> Let them other brothers try, at least
         you tried for it <br /> When it's time to die, to be a man and pick the way you leave <br />
         <span class="profanity">Fuck</span> peace and the police, my ambitions as a ridah <br />
         <br />
         <br /> I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah <br /> You don't wanna <span class="profanity"
            >fuck</span> with me <br /> Got the police bustin' at me <br /> But they can't do
         nothin' to a G <br /> Let's get ready to rumble <br />
         <br />
         <br /> My murderous lyrics, equipped with spirits of the thugs before me <br />
         <span class="lifeEvent">Pay off the block, evade the cops ‘cause I know they comin' for
            me</span>
         <br /> I been hesitant to reappear, been away for years <br /> Now I'm back, my adversaries
         been reduced to tears <br /> Question my methods to switch up speeds <br /> Sure as some
            <span class="profanity">bitches</span> bleed <br />
         <span class="profanity">Niggas'll</span> feel the fire of my mother's corrupted seed <br />
         Blast me, but they didn't finish, didn't diminish my powers <br /> (Buck buck buck buck
         buck!) <br /> So now I'm back to be a <span class="profanity">motherfuckin'</span> menace,
         they cowards <br /> That's why they tried to set me up <br /> Had <span class="profanity"
            >bitch-ass niggas</span> on my team, so indeed they wet me up <br /> But I'm back
         reincarnated, incarcerated <br /> At the time I contemplate the way that God made it <br />
         Lace'em with lyrics that's legendary, musical mercenary <br /> For money I'll have these
            <span class="profanity">motherfuckers</span> buried <br /> I been gettin' much mail in
         jail, niggas tellin' me to kill it <br /> Knowin' when I get out they gon' feel it <br />
         Witness the realest! A hoo-ridah when I put the <span class="profanity">shit</span> inside
         <br /> The cry from all your people when they find her <br /> Just remind ya, my history'll
         prove authentic <br /> Revenge on them <span class="profanity">niggas</span> that played me
         <br /> And all the cowards that was down with it <br /> Now it's your <span
            class="profanity">nigga</span> right beside ya, hopin' you listenin' <br /> Catch you
         payin' attention to my ambitions as a ridah <br />
         <br />
         <br /> I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah <br /> You don't wanna <span class="profanity"

         <br /> Brenda's got a baby <br />
         <br />
         <br /> Singer: 2Pac <br />
         <br /> I hear Brenda's got a baby, <br /> but Brenda's barely got a brain <br /> A damn
         shame, the girl can hardly spell her name <br /> "That's not our problem, that's up to
         Brenda's family" <br /> Well, let me show you how it affects our whole community <br /> Now
         Brenda really never knew her moms <br /> And her dad was a junkie, puttin' death into his
         arms <br /> It's sad, 'cause I bet Brenda doesn't even know <br /> Just 'cause you're in
         the ghetto doesn't mean you can't grow <br /> But oh, that's a thought, my own revelation
         <br /> Do whatever it takes to resist the temptation <br /> Brenda got herself a boyfriend
         <br /> Her boyfriend was her cousin, now let's watch the joy end <br />
         <span class="lifeEvent">She tried to hide her pregnancy, from her family</span>
         <br /> Who really didn't care to see, or give a <span class="lifeEvent">damn</span> if she
         <br /> Went out and had a church of kids <br /> As long as when the check came they got
         first dibs <br /> Now Brenda's belly's gettin' bigger <br /> But no one seems to notice any
         change in her figure <br />
         <span class="lifeEvent">She's twelve years old and she's havin' a baby</span>
         <br /> In love with a molester, who's sexin' her crazy <br /> And yet and she thinks that
         he'll be with her forever <br /> And dreams of a world where the two of them are together
         Whatever, <br />
         <span class="lifeEvent">he left her and she had the baby solo</span>
         <br />
         <span class="lifeEvent"> She had it on the bathroom floor and didn't know, so</span>
         <br /> She didn't know what to throw away and what to keep <br /> She wrapped the baby up
         and threw him in a trash heap <br /> I guess she thought she'd get away, wouldn't hear the
         cries <br /> She didn't realize how much the little baby had her eyes <br /> Now the baby's
         in the trash heap, bawlin' <br /> Momma can't help her, but it hurt to hear her callin'
         <br /> Brenda wants to run away <br /> Momma say you makin' me lose pay <br /> There's
         social workers here every day <br /> Now Brenda's gotta make her own way <br /> Can't go to
         her family, they won't let her stay <br /> No money, no babysitter, she couldn't keep a job <br />
         <span class="lifeEvent">She tried to sell crack but end up gettin' robbed</span>
         <br /> So now, what's next? There ain't nothin' left to sell <br /> So she sees sex as a
         way of leavin' hell <br /> It's payin' the rent, so she really can't complain <br />
         Prostitute, found slain, and Brenda's her name She's got a baby <br />
         <br />
