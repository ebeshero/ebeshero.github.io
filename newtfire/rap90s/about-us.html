            <p>Hello! This website was set up by 2 University of Pittsburgh students, Wesley Ho and
                Monica Felix, to display our work analyzing 90s rap music for our class
                Computational Methods in the Humanities.</p>

            <h2>Wesley Ho</h2>
            <p>Hi, I'm a 2021 graduate of the University of Pittsburgh main campus where I am
                working towards a bachelors degree in Information Science as well as considering a
                second major in economics. As a member of the Rap-90s project, I wrote the schema,
                some of the lyrics, most of the website, and worked on the varius data
                visualizations included in the website.</p>
            <br />
            <h2>Monica Felix</h2>
            <p>I will be a graduate of 2018 of University Pittsburghâ€™s main campus. I am studying
                Finance with two minors in Italian and Spanish, as well as a certificate in
                International Business. I worked on the song lyrics, the development of the website,
                and wrote the history of the rappers and the analysis for the project.</p>
