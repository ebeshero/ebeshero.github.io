            <h2>About our Album Choice:</h2>
            <p>We picked two albums for both Tupac and Eminem (for a total of four albums that we
                are analyzing) that were all released in the 1990s. The qualifications in choosing
                the albums were fairly simple: they had to be written and released in the 1990s and
                the distinction between the two albums for each album was their certification. This
                certification is based on the number of copies the album sold. We used the RIAA
                (Recording Industry Association of America) certification categories, which are
                gold, platinum, and diamond. For gold certification in the United States, the album
                would had to have sold 500,000 copies, 1,000,000 for platinum, and 10,000,000 for
                diamond. In our analysis for this project, we wanted to compare what made an album
                “gold” worthy, for the lowest rank, and an album “platinum” worthy, for the highest
                rank. For Tupac, the two albums we picked were 2Pacalypse Now (gold) and All Eyez on
                Me (diamond). 2Pacalypse Now is his only album out of the five albums he released
                that was certified gold. The rest of Tupac’s albums were certified as platinum,
                except for All Eyez on Me, which was diamond. This album is also labeled as one of
                the greatest hip-hop albums of the 90s era. Out of Eminem’s discography in the 90s,
                he only had two albums released during this time period, so we used this two. His
                first album, Infinite, is gold certified and The Slim Shady LP is platinum (4 times
                over) certified. Eminem does have two diamond certified albums but those were
                released after 2000 so we chose to use The Slim Shady LP in our analysis even though
                it did not have the diamond certification. The main objective is to see why one
                album did not sell as well as the other by the same artist. </p>

            <h2>About the Factors Analyzed:</h2>
            <p>The factors that we analyzed that potentially could have contributed to the
                popularity and sales of the albums were the following: the presence of profanity,
                derogatory terms, emotion terms, and life events in the lyrics. We chose these
                variables as determining factors due to their relationship with how rap is
                structured and is embodied. Rap is like poetry and rappers like to tell their life
                story, such as Tupac and Eminem, in their lyrics. Emotion words are apparent in
                lyrics to describing the feelings of the rappers, which is another important thing
                for them to express in their songs. As for profanity and derogatory terms, these act
                as more of filler words to make the verse and overall lyrics flow better. We found
                that the higher rated certified albums (Tupac’s All Eyez on Me and Eminem’s The Slim
                Shady LP) had higher numbers of these factors within their songs in comparison to
                the gold certified albums. In some of the songs in the gold albums, none of these
                factors were present at all or only very little. </p>
