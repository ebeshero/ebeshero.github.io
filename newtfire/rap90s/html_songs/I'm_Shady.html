         <h1>Song Title: I'm Shady</h1>
         <h2>Artist: Eminem</h2>
         <h4>Producer: Eminem</h4>
         <h4>Producer: Bass Brothers</h4>
         <h4>Album: The Slim Shady EP</h4>
         <h4>Certification: Diamond</h4> <br /> Who came through with two Glocks to terrorize your borough? (Huh?!) <br /> Told you how to slap dips and murder your girl? (I did) <br /> Gave you all the finger and told you to sit and twirl <br /> Sold a billion tapes, and still screamed "<span class="profanity">Fuck</span>
         the world!" <br /> (Slim Shady…) so come and kill me while my name's hot <br /> And shoot me 25 times in the same spot <br /> I think I got a generation brainwashed <br /> To pop pills and smoke pot 'til they brains rot <br /> Stop they blood flow until they veins clot <br /> I need a pain shot and a shot of plain Scotch <br /> Purple haze and acid raindrops <br /> Spike the punch at the party and drink pop <br /> Shaved my armpits and wore a tank top <br /> Bad Boy, I told you that I can't stop <br /> You gotta make 'em <span class="emotion">fear</span> you before you make 'em
         feel you <br /> So everybody buy my <span class="profanity">shit</span> or I'ma come and kill
         you <br />  <br />  <br /> I got mushrooms, I got acid <br /> I got tabs and aspirin tablets <br /> I'm your brother when you need <br /> Some good weed to set you free <br /> You know me, I'm your friend <br /> When you need a Mini Thin <br /> (I'm Slim Shady…) I'm Shady! <br />  <br />  <br /> I like happy things, I'm really calm and peaceful <br /> I like birds, bees, I like people <br /> I like funny things that make me happy and gleeful <br /> Like when my teacher sucked my wee-wee in preschool <br /> The ill type, I stab myself with a steel spike <br /> While I blow my brain out just to see what it feels like <br /> ‘Cause this is how I am in real life <br /> I don't want to just die a normal death <br /> I wanna be killed twice <br /> How you gonna scare somebody with a gun threat <br /> When they high off of drugs they haven't even done yet? <br /> So bring the money by tonight, ‘cause your wife <br /> Said this the biggest knife she ever saw in her life (help me!) <br /> I try to keep it positive and play it cool <br /> Shoot up the playground and tell the kids to stay in school ("Stay in
         school!") <br /> ‘Cause I'm the one they can relate to and look up to better <br /> Tonight I think I'll write my biggest fan a <span class="profanity">fuck-you</span> letter <br />  <br />  <br /> I got mushrooms, I got acid <br /> I got tabs and aspirin tablets <br /> I'm your brother when you need <br /> Some good weed to set you free <br /> You know me, I'm your friend <br /> When you need a Mini Thin <br /> (I'm Slim Shady…) I'm Shady! <br />  <br />  <br /> I listen to your demo tape <br /> And act like I don't like it ("Ahh, that <span class="profanity">shit</span> is
         wack!") <br /> Six months later you hear your lyrics on my <span class="profanity">shit</span> <br /> ("That's my <span class="profanity">shit</span>!") <br /> People don't buy <span class="profanity">shit</span> no more, they just dub
         it <br /> That's why I'm still broke and had the number-one club hit <br /> But they love it when you make your business public <br /> So <span class="profanity">fuck</span> it, I've got herpes while we on the
         subject (uh-huh) <br /> And if I told you I had AIDS, y'all would play it <br /> ‘Cause you stupid <span class="profanity">mothafuckas</span> think I'm playin'
         when I say it <br /> Well, I do take pills, don't do speed <br /> Don't do crack, don't do coke, I do smoke weed <br /> Don't do smack, I do do shrooms, do drink beer <br /> I just wanna make a few things clear <br /> My baby mama's not dead, she's still alive and <span class="profanity">bitchin'</span> <br /> And I don't have herpes, my dick's just itchin' <br /> It's not syphilis, and as for being AIDS-infested <br /> I don't know yet, I'm too scared to get tested <br />  <br />  <br /> I got mushrooms, I got acid <br /> I got tabs and aspirin tablets <br /> I'm your brother when you need <br /> Some good weed to set you free <br /> You know me, I'm your friend <br /> When you need a Mini Thin <br /> (I'm Slim Shady…) I'm Shady! <br />  <br />  <br /> Told you I was Shady <br /> Y'all didn't believe me <br /> I'm Shady! <br /> And that's my name <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />
