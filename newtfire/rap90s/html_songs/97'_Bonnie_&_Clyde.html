She's takin' a little nap in the trunk <br /> Oh, that smell? Dada must've runned over a skunk <br /> Now, I know what you're thinkin', it's kind of late to go swimmin' <br /> But you know your Mama, she's one of those type of women <br /> That do crazy things, and if she don't get her way she'll throw a fit <br /> Don't play with Dada's toy knife, honey, let go of it! (no!) <br /> And don't look so upset, why you actin' bashful? <br /> Don't you wanna help Dada build a sandcastle? (yeah!) <br /> And Mama said she wants to show how far she can float <br /> And don't worry about that little boo-boo on her throat <br /> It's just a little scratch – it don't hurt <br /> Her was eatin' dinner while you were sweepin' <br /> And spilled ketchup on her shirt <br /> Mama's messy, ain't she? We'll let her wash off in the water <br /> And me and you can pway by ourselves, can't we? <br />  <br />  <br /> Just the two of us, just the two of us <br /> And when we ride <br /> Just the two of us, just the two of us <br /> Just you and I <br /> Just the two of us, just the two of us <br /> And when we ride <br /> Just the two of us, just the two of us <br /> Just you and I <br />  <br />  <br /> See, honey, there's a place called Heaven and a place called Hell <br /> A place called prison and a place called jail <br /> And Dada's probably on his way to all of 'em except one <br /> ‘Cause Mama's got a new husband and a stepson <br /> And you don't want a brother, do ya? <br /> Maybe when you're old enough <br /> To understand a little better, I'll explain it to ya <br /> But for now, we'll just say Mama was real, real bad <br /> She was bein' mean to Dad and made him real, real <span class="emotion">mad</span> <br /> But I still feel <span class="emotion">sad</span> that I put her on
         timeout <br /> Sit back in your chair, honey, quit tryna climb out! <br /> I told you it's okay, Hai-Hai, want a ba-ba? <br /> Take a night-night? Nan-a-boo, goo-goo ga-ga? <br /> Her make poo-poo ca-ca? Dada change your didee <br /> Clean the baby up so her can take a nighty-nighty <br /> Your dad'll wake her up as soon as we get to the water <br /> '97 Bonnie and Clyde: me and my daughter <br />  <br />  <br /> Just the two of us, just the two of us <br /> And when we ride <br /> Just the two of us, just the two of us <br /> Just you and I <br /> Just the two of us, just the two of us <br /> And when we ride <br /> Just the two of us, just the two of us <br /> Just you and I <br />  <br />  <br /> Wake up, sweepyhead, we're here, before we pway <br /> We're gonna take Mama for a wittle walk along the pier <br /> Baby, don't cry, honey, don't get the wrong idea <br /> Mama's too sweepy to hear you screamin' in her ear (Mama!) <br /> That's why you can't get her to wake, but don't worry <br /> Dada made a nice bed for Mommy at the bottom of the lake <br /> Here, you wanna help Dada tie a rope around this rock? (yea) <br /> We'll tie it to her footsie then we'll roll her off the dock <br /> Ready now, here we go, on the count of free <br /> One, two, free — whee! (woosh!) <br /> There goes Mama, spashin' in the water <br /> No more fightin' with Dad, no more restrainin' order <br /> No more stepdada, no more new brother <br /> Blow her kisses bye-bye, tell Mama you wuv her (Mommy!) <br /> Now we'll go play in the sand, build a castle and junk <br /> But first, just help Dad with two more things out the trunk <br />  <br />  <br /> Just the two of us, just the two of us <br /> And when we ride <br /> Just the two of us, just the two of us <br /> Just you and I <br /> Just the two of us, just the two of us <br /> And when we ride <br /> Just the two of us, just the two of us <br /> Just you and I <br />  <br />  <br /> Just me and you, baby, is all we need in this world <br /> Just me and you <br /> Your dada will always be there for you <br /> Your dada's always gonna love you, remember that <br /> If you ever need me I will always be here for you <br /> If you ever need anything, just ask <br /> Dada will be right there <br /> Your dada loves you — I love you, baby <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />
