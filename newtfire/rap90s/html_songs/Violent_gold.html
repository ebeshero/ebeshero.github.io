         <h4>Certification: Gold </h4> <br /> They claim that I'm violent <br /> Just cause I refuse to be silent <br /> These hypocrites are havin' fits <br /> ’Cause I'm not buyin' it, defyin' it <br /> <span class="emotion">Envious</span> because I will rebel against <br /> Any oppressor - and this is known as self defense <br /> I show no mercy, they claim that I'm the lunatic <br /> But when the <span class="profanity">shit</span> gets thick, I'm the one you go
         and get <br /> Don't look confused, the truth is so plain to see <br /> ’Cause I'm the <span class="profanity">nigga</span> that you sell-outs are
         <span class="emotion">ashamed</span> to be <br /> In every jeep and every car, brothers stomp this <br /> I'm Never Ignorant, Getting Goals Accomplished <br /> The Underground Railroad on an uprise <br /> This time the truth's gettin' told, heard enough lies <br /> I told 'em fight back, attack on society <br /> If this is violence, then violent's what I gotta be <br /> If you investigate you'll find out where it's comin' from <br /> Look through our history, America's the violent one <br /> Unlock my brain, break the chains of your misery <br /> This time the payback for evil <span class="profanity">shit</span> you did to
         me <br /> They call me militant, racist, cause I will resist <br /> You wanna censor somethin', <span class="profanity">motherfucker</span> censor
         this! <br /> My words are weapons and I'm steppin' to the silent <br /> Wakin' up the masses, but you, claim that I'm violent <br />  <br />  <br /> "They claimin' that I'm violent" <br /> "<span class="profanity">Fuck</span> the <span class="profanity">damn</span>
         cop!" <br /> "Just because we play what the people want" <br />  <br />  <br /> "They claimin' that I'm violent" <br /> "<span class="profanity">Fuck</span> the <span class="profanity">damn</span>
         cop!" <br /> "Just because we play what the people want" <br />  <br />  <br /> "They claimin' that I'm violent" <br /> "<span class="profanity">Fuck</span> the <span class="profanity">damn</span>
         cop!" <br /> "Just because we play what the people want" <br />  <br />  <br /> The cops can't stand me, but they can't touch me <br /> Call me a dope man, cause I rock dope beats <br /> Jacked by the police, didn't have my ID <br /> I said, "Excuse me, why you tryin' to rob me?" <br /> He had the nerve to, say that I had a curfew <br /> ("Do you know what time it is? <br /> Get out the <span class="profanity">fucking</span> car, or I'll hurt
         you!") <br /> Get out the car - or I'lI hurt you <br /> So here I go, I better make my mind up <br /> Pick my nine up or hit the line-up <br /> I chose B, stepped into the streets <br /> The first cop grabbed me, the other ripped my seat <br /> They grabbed my homie and they threw him to the concrete <br /> (Ay man... Aiyyo... Ay man, just c'mon?) <br /> ("What you doin man?") <br /> They tried to frame me <br /> They tried to say I had some dope in the back seat <br /> But I'm a rap fiend, not a crack fiend <br /> My homie panicked ("I'm out") he tried to run <br /> (Freeze <span class="profanity">nigga</span>!) I heard a bullet fire from the
         cop's gun <br /> My homie dropped, so I hit the cop <br /> I kept swingin', yo, I couldn't stop <br /> Before I knew it, I was beatin' the cop senseless <br /> The other cop dropped his gun, he was defenseless <br /> (Argh, <span class="">fuck</span> you! Ungh!) <br /> Now I'm against this cop who was racist <br /> Givin' him a taste, of trading places <br /> And all this, cause the peckerwood was tryin' this <br /> Frame up, but I came up <br /> Now they claimin' that I'm violent <br />  <br />  <br /> "They claimin' that I'm violent" <br /> "<span class="profanity">Fuck</span> the <span class="profanity">damn</span>
         cop!" <br /> "Just because we play what the people want" <br />  <br />  <br /> As I was beatin' on a cop, I heard a gun click (uh-ohh) <br /> Then the gun shot, but I wasn't hit <br /> I turned around it was my homie with the gun in hand <br /> He shot the cop (<span class="profanity">Damn</span>!) now he's a dead
         man <br /> I said, come on, it's time for us to get away <br /> (Let's go, we gotta get the <span class="profanity">fuck</span> outta
         here.) <br /> They called for backup, and they'll be on their way <br /> Jumped in the car and tried to get away quick <br /> The car wouldn't start (<span class="profanity">Damn</span>!) we in deep
         shit <br /> So we jumped out (C'mon, let's take the cop's car) <br /> We drove a little ways thinkin' that we got far <br /> But I looked up and all I saw was blue lights <br /> (that's a lotta of one time) <br /> If I die tonight, I'm dying in a gunfight <br /> I grabbed the AK, my homie took the 12 gauge <br /> (yeah, it's on now) <br /> Load 'em up quick, it's time for us to spray <br /> We'll shoot 'em up with they own <span class="profanity">fuckin'</span>
         weapons <br /> And when we through sprayin' then we steppin' <br /> This is a lesson, to the rednecks and crooked cops <br /> You <span class="profanity">fuck</span> with real <span class="profanity">niggas</span>, get ya <span class="profanity">fuckin'</span>
         <span class="profanity">ass</span> dropped <br /> So here we go, the police against us <br /> Dark as dusk, waitin' for the guns to bust <br /> (What's next man?) What's next, I don't know and I don't care <br /> One thing fo' sho', tommorrow I won't be here <br /> But if I go, I'm takin' all these punks with me <br /> (Pass me a clip) Pass me a clip, G, now come and get me <br /> You wanna sweat me, never get me to be silent <br /> Givin' them a reason, to claim that I'm violent <br />  <br />  <br /> "They claimin' that I'm violent" <br /> "<span class="profanity">Fuck</span> the <span class="profanity">damn</span>
         cop!" <br /> "Just because we play what the people want" <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />
