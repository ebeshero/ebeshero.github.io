            me</span> <br /> Poppa was a nasty old man, like the rest <br /> <span class="lifeEvent">He's feelin' on my chest, with his hand in my
            dress</span> <br /> Just another pest and yes I was nervous <br /> Was this a test? I just don't deserve this <br /> I wanna tell mom, but would she listen <br /> She's bound to be <span class="profanity">bitchin'</span> if she hasn't got a
         fix in, so <br /> Now I lay me down to sleep, Lord don't let him rape me <br /> If he does my soul to keep, don't let the devil take me <br /> Can't concentrate I contemplate in my classroom <br /> <span class="lifeEvent">Thinkin' how my step dad raped me in the
            bathroom</span> <br /> <span class="lifeEvent">Every day I make class and yet I'm missin'
            periods</span> <br /> The thought of pregnancy is in my head and now I'm <span class="emotion">fearin'</span>
         it <br /> I gotta tell mom before she sees me <br /> <span class="lifeEvent">I told her how he treated me and she didn't believe
            me</span> <br /> Callin' me a slut cause my butt's kinda big so <br /> Still that ain't no way to be talkin' to your kids though <br /> I can't believe the way he caught her <br /> Got her believin' him and dissin' her own daughter <br /> Time for me to break and find another <br /> That's when I discovered <br /> The ways of the days of a part time mutha <br />  <br />  <br /> Singer: [2Pac] <br />  <br /> I gotta live with a part time <br />  <br />  <br /> She's a part time mutha <br />  <br />  <br /> Singer: 2Pac <br />  <br /> I rush to tend her, talked as I touch her <br /> She blushed, the clothes came off and I bust her <br /> I'm up now, ready to get drunk on the block <br /> Here, take a cab, thanks a lot for the cock <br /> She's gone and I'm thinkin' that my game's so strong <br /> Pat myself on the back and move on <br /> Is this just how it is <span class="profanity">hell</span> no <br /> <span class="lifeEvent">Cause she came back with the kid and yo</span> <br /> I been payin' ever since <br /> The clothes the food the cars and, oh, the rent <br /> All of my time gets spent at the workplace <br /> No time to kiss her got me this in the first place <br /> So, I do the dishes and clean the floor <br /> When I sleep I can't dream no more <br /> Oh no, now I'm a part time mutha <br /> And I change the diapers and clean the <span class="profanity">shit</span> <br /> The tables are turned I can't take this <br /> Oh no, now I'm a part time mutha <br />  <br />  <br /> She's a part time mutha <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />
