         <h1>Song Title: Tonite</h1>
         <h2>Artist: Eminem</h2>
         <h4>Producer: Jeff Bass and Mr. Porter</h4>
         <h4>Album: Infinite</h4>
         <h4>Certification: Gold</h4> <br /> I'm gettin' mad love, I'm snugglin' hugs <br /> Strugglin' thugs, smugglin' drugs <br /> Jugglin' jobs, guzzlin' jugs <br /> So here's a toast to federal checks <br /> Hetero sex, unaffordable medical debts <br /> We travel in packs, unravelin' facts <br /> And gravel in cracks to find babblin' max, gafflin' tracks <br /> I grapple an axe for them bafflin' acts <br /> Of mysterious stab-in-the-backs who dabble in wax <br /> Stealin' my art when I sculpt it <br /> The culprit that stole <span class="profanity">shit'll</span> end up with his
         skull split <br /> Then I buried the hatchet, I carry the fat <span class="profanity">shit</span> <br /> Butterfingers is here when it's necessary to scratch it <br /> Baby, all I wanna do is swallow one or two <br /> Smoke a little bit and follow one of you <br /> Back home when the party ends <br /> So tonight I'm droppin' naughty hints <br /> To the finest women in the audience <br />  <br />  <br /> ’Cause we came here to do this tonight <br /> We don't wanna fight <br /> We don't want no one feelin' uptight <br /> ’Cause we came here to do this tonight <br /> ’Til the morning light <br /> Hope that everyone's feelin' alright <br />  <br />  <br /> Ayo, biters are like tarantulas, vandalous <br /> Livin' as scandalous as a television evangelist <br /> But I can handle this; I'm the rhyme biter, crime fighter <br /> Caped crusader, takin' care of undeservin' lime lighters <br /> I think we live in era meant for me <br /> Experimentally I found a way to spread the terror mentally <br /> When I stumbled upon this resolution <br /> By usin' a special fusion <br /> Of chemical solution for this fresh illusion <br /> You couldn't see me with binoculars <br /> I'm armed like an octopus <br /> Step on stage and you'll get socked and pushed <br /> Talkin' that junk like you had Black Bart at your back <br /> Come to battle me and you get smacked hard as you act <br /> When I rep-a-resent it, and will have a referee in it <br /> Every minute, so when I win it you never resent it <br /> I'm forever demented <br /> Come up with funk, I'll never be scented <br /> You got the point when I cleverly sent it <br />  <br />  <br /> ’Cause we came here to do this tonight <br /> We don't wanna fight <br /> We don't want no one feelin' uptight <br /> ’Cause we came here to do this tonight <br /> ’Til the morning light <br /> Hope that everyone's feelin' alright <br />  <br />  <br /> Eminem is headed skyward <br /> For those who thought that I would <br /> Make you bored and treat you like a piece of plywood <br /> I've got miracle lyrical capability all in me <br /> With the agility to escape a killer bee colony <br /> So get your cameras and capture how miraculous <br /> I rap for all you Draculas <br /> And showed you all how wack you was <br /> I meant it as a diss <br /> ‘Cause you don't posses the pizazz of this <br /> I'm hazardous enough already as it is <br /> Without you addin' fuel to the fire; I'm cruel to the liar <br /> Who fails to recognize my reign and hail rule to the sire <br /> <span class="lifeEvent">Clinical studies show that I'm cynical
            </span> <br /> There's no one who's identical <br /> To my fresh and authentic flow <br /> I'm sure the party people can agree <br /> That I'm enchantin' rhythm romantically <br /> Freakin' vocals so frantically <br /> So throw your hands up in the atmosphere <br /> And let them know the only party that was phat was here <br />  <br />  <br /> ’Cause we came here to do this tonight <br /> We don't wanna fight <br /> We don't want no one feelin' uptight <br /> ’Cause we came here to do this tonight <br /> ’Til the morning light <br /> Hope that everyone's feelin' alright <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />
