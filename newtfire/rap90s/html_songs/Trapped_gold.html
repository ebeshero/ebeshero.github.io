         <h4>Certification: Gold</h4> <br /> You know they got me trapped in this prison of seclusion <br /> <span class="emotion">Happiness</span>, living on the streets is a
         delusion <br /> Even a smooth criminal one day must get caught <br /> Shot up or shot down with the bullet that he bought <br /> Nine millimeter kickin' thinkin' about what the streets do to me <br /> Cause they never talk peace in the black community <br /> All we know is violence, do the job in silence <br /> Walk the city streets like a rat pack of tyrants <br /> Too many brothers daily heading for the big pen <br /> <span class="profanity">Niggas</span> comin' out worse-off than when they went
         in <br /> Over the years I done a lot of growin' up <br /> Gettin drunk, throwin' up <br /> Cuffed up <br /> Then I said I had enough <br /> There must be another route, way out <br /> To money and fame, I changed my name <br /> And played a different game <br /> Tired of being trapped in this vicious cycle <br /> If one more cop harrasses me I just might go psycho <br /> And when I get 'em, I'll hit 'em with the bum rush <br /> Only a lunatic would like to see his skull crushed <br /> Yo, if you're smart you'll really let me go, G <br /> But keep me cooped up in this ghetto and catch the Uzi <br /> They got me trapped <br />  <br />  <br /> Uh uh, they can't keep the black man down <br /> They got me trapped <br /> Naw, they can't keep the black man down <br /> Trapped <br /> Uh uh, they can't keep the black man down <br /> Trapped <br /> Naw, they can't keep the black man down <br />  <br />  <br /> They got me trapped <br /> Can barely walk the city streets <br /> Without a cop harrassing me, searching me <br /> Then asking my identity <br /> Hands up, throw me up against the wall <br /> Didn't do a thing at all <br /> I'm telling you one day these suckers gotta fall <br /> Cuffed up throw me on the concrete <br /> Coppers try to kill me <br /> But they didn't know this was the wrong street <br /> Bang bang, count another casualty <br /> But it's a cop who's shot for his brutality <br /> Who do you blame? It's a shame because the man's slain <br /> He got caught in the chains of his own game <br /> How can I feel guilty after all the things they did to me? <br /> Sweated me, hunted me <br /> Trapped in my own community <br /> One day I'm gonna bust <br /> Blow up on this society <br /> Why did ya lie to me? <br /> I couldn't find a trace of equality <br /> Work me like a slave while they laid back <br /> Homie don't play that <br /> It's time I let 'em suffer the payback <br /> I'm tryin to avoid physical contact <br /> I can't hold back, it's time to attack jack <br /> They got me trapped <br />  <br />  <br /> Uh uh, they can't keep the black man down <br /> They got me trapped <br /> Naw, they can't keep the black man down <br /> Trapped <br /> Uh uh, they can't keep the black man down <br /> Trapped <br /> Naw, they can't keep the black man down <br />  <br />  <br /> Now I'm trapped and want to find my getaway <br /> All I need is a 'G' and somewhere safe to stay <br /> Can't use the phone <br /> Cause I'm sure someone is tapping in <br /> Did it before <br /> Ain't scared to use my gat again <br /> I look back in hindsight the fight was irrelevant <br /> But now he's the devils friend <br /> Too late to be tellin' him <br /> He shot first and I'll be <span class="profanity">damned</span> if I run
         away <br /> Homie is done away I should've put my gun away <br /> I wasn't thinkin' all I heard was the ridicule <br /> Girlies was laughin', Tup sayin "<span class="profanity">Damn</span> homies is
         dissin you" <br /> I fired my weapon <br /> Started steppin' in the hurricane <br /> I got shot so I dropped <br /> Feelin' a burst of pain <br /> Got to my feet <br /> Couldn't see nothin' but bloody blood <br /> Now I'm a fugitive to be hunted like a murderer <br /> Ran through an alley <br /> Still lookin' for my getaway <br /> Coppers said, "Freeze, or you'll be dead today." <br /> Trapped in a corner <br /> Dark and I couldn't see the light <br /> Thoughts in my mind was the nine and a better life <br /> What do I do? Live my life in a prison cell? <br /> I'd rather die than be trapped in a living hell <br /> They got me trapped <br />  <br />  <br /> Uh uh, they can't keep the black man down <br /> They got me trapped <br /> Naw, they can't keep the black man down <br /> Trapped <br /> Uh uh, they can't keep the black man down <br /> Trapped <br /> Naw, they can't keep the black man down <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />
