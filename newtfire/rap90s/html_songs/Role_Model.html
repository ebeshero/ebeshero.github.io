         <h1>Song Title: Role Model</h1>
         <h2>Artist: Eminem</h2>
         <h4>Producer: Dr. Dre</h4>
         <h4>Producer: Mel-Man</h4>
         <h4>Album: The Slim Shady EP</h4>
         <h4>Certification: Diamond</h4> <br /> Okay, I'm going to attempt to drown myself <br /> You can try this at home <br /> You can be just like me <br /> Mic check, one-two, we recording? <br />  <br />  <br /> I'm cancerous <br /> So when I diss, you wouldn't wanna answer this <br /> If you responded back with a battle rap you wrote for Canibus <br /> I'll strangle you to death, then I'll choke you again <br /> And break your <span class="profanity">fucking</span> legs 'til your bones poke
         through your skin <br /> You beef with me, I'ma even the score equally <br /> Take you on Jerry Springer and beat your <span class="profanity">ass</span>
         legally <br /> I get too blunted off of funny home grown <br /> ‘Cause when I smoke out I hit the trees harder than Sonny Bono <br /> (Oh no!) So if I said I never did drugs <br /> That would mean I lie and get <span class="profanity">fucked</span> <br /> More than the President does <br /> Hilary Clinton tried to slap me and call me a pervert <br /> I ripped her <span class="profanity">fucking</span> tonsils out and fed her
         sherbet (<span class="dt">Bitch</span>) <br /> My nerves hurt, and lately I'm on edge <br /> Grabbed Vanilla Ice and ripped out his blond dreads <br /> Every girl I ever went out with has gone les <br /> Follow me and do exactly what the song says <br /> Smoke weed, take pills, drop out of school, kill people <br /> And drink, jump behind the wheel like it was still legal <br /> I'm dumb enough to walk in a store and steal <br /> So I'm dumb enough to ask for a date with Lauryn Hill <br /> Some people only see that I'm white, ignorin' skill <br /> ‘Cause I stand out like a green hat with a orange bill <br /> But I don't get pissed, y'all don't even see through the mist <br /> How the <span class="profanity">fuck</span> can I be white? I don't even
         exist <br /> I get a clean shave, bathe, go to a rave <br /> Die from an overdose and dig myself up out of my grave <br /> My middle finger won't go down, how do I wave? <br /> And this is how I'm supposed to teach kids how to behave? <br />  <br />  <br /> Now follow me and do exactly what you see <br /> Don't you wanna grow up to be just like me? <br /> I slap women and eat shrooms then OD <br /> Now don't you want to grow up to be just like me? <br />  <br />  <br /> Me and Marcus Allen went over to see Nicole <br /> When we heard a knock at the door, must've been Ron Gold <br /> Jumped behind the door, put the orgy on hold <br /> Killed them both, then smeared blood on the white Bronco <br /> (We did it!) My mind won't work if my spine don't jerk <br /> I slapped Garth Brooks out of his rhinestone shirt <br /> I'm not a player, just a ill rhyme sayer <br /> That'll spray a aerosol can up at the ozone layer <br /> My rap style's warped, I'm running out the morgue <br /> With your dead grandmother's corpse to throw it on your porch <br /> Jumped in a Chickenhawk cartoon with a cape on <br /> And beat up Foghorn Leghorn with an acorn <br /> I'm 'bout as normal as Norman Bates with deformative traits <br /> A premature birth that was four minutes late <br /> Mother, are you there? I love you <br /> I never meant to hit you over the head with that shovel <br /> Will someone please explain to my brain <br /> That I just severed the main vein with a chainsaw and I'm in pain? <br /> I take a breather and sigh; either I'm high <br /> Or I'm nuts, ‘cause if you ain't tilting this room, neither am I <br /> So when you see your mom with a thermometer <br /> Shoved in her <span class="profanity">ass</span>, then it probably is obvious I
         got it on with her <br /> ‘Cause when I drop this solo <span class="profanity">shit</span>, it's over
         with <br /> I bought Cage's tape, opened it, and dubbed over it <br />  <br />  <br /> I came to the club drunk with a fake ID <br /> Don't you wanna grow up to be just like me? <br /> I've been with ten women who got HIV <br /> Now don't you wanna grow up to be just like me? <br /> I got genital warts and it burns when I pee <br /> Don't you wanna grow up to be just like me? <br /> I tie a rope around my penis and jump from a tree <br /> You probably wanna grow up to be just like me <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />
