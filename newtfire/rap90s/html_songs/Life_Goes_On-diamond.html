         a G <br /> Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death <br /> My <span class="profanity">niggas</span>, we the last ones left, but life goes
         on <br /> How many brothers fell victim to the streets? <br /> Rest in peace, young <span class="profanity">nigga</span>, there's a heaven for
         a G <br /> Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death <br /> My <span class="profanity">niggas</span>, we the last ones left, but life goes
         on <br />  <br />  <br /> As I bail through the empty halls, breath stinkin' in my jaws <br /> Ring, ring, ring — quiet, y'all, incomin' call <br /> Plus this my homie from high school, he gettin' by <br /> It's time to bury another brother, nobody cry <br /> Life as a baller: alcohol and booty calls <br /> We used to do 'em as adolescents, do you recall? <br /> Raised as G's, loc'ed out, and blazed the weed <br /> Get on the roof, let's get smoked out, and blaze with me <br /> Two in the morning and we still high, <span class="profanity">assed</span>
         out <br /> Screamin', "Thug 'til I die!" before I passed out <br /> But now that you're gone, I'm in the zone <br /> Thinkin' I don't wanna die all alone, but now you gone <br /> And all I got left are stinkin' memories <br /> I love them <span class="profanity">niggas</span> to death, I'm drinkin'
         Hennessy <br /> While tryin' to make it last <br /> I drank a fifth for that ass when you passed, 'cause life goes on <br />  <br />  <br /> How many brothers fell victim to the streets? <br /> Rest in peace, young <span class="profanity">nigga</span>, there's a heaven for
         a G <br /> Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death <br /> My <span class="profanity">niggas</span>, we the last ones left, but life goes
         on <br /> How many brothers fell victim to the streets? <br /> Rest in peace, young <span class="profanity">nigga</span>, there's a heaven for
         a G <br /> Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death <br /> My <span class="profanity">niggas</span>, we the last ones left, but life goes
         on <br />  <br />  <br /> Yeah <span class="profanity">nigga</span>, I got the word it's hell <br /> You blew trial and the judge gave you 25 with an L <br /> Time to prepare to do fed time, won't see parole <br /> Imagine life as a convict that's gettin' old <br /> Plus with the drama, we're lookin' out for your baby's mama <br /> Takin' risks, while keepin' cheap tricks from gettin' on her <br /> Life in the hood is all good for nobody <br /> Remember gamin' on dumb hotties at yo' party <br /> Me and you, no truer two, while schemin' on hits <br /> And gettin' <span class="dt">tricks</span> that maybe we can slide into <br /> But now you buried — rest, <span class="profanity">nigga</span>, 'cause I ain't
         worried <br /> Eyes blurry, sayin' goodbye at the cemetery <br /> Though memories fade <br /> I got your name tatted on my arm so we both ball 'til my dyin' days <br /> Before I say goodbye <br /> Kato and Mental, rest in peace! Thug 'til I die! <br />  <br />  <br /> How many brothers fell victim to the streets? <br /> Rest in peace, young <span class="profanity">nigga</span>, there's a heaven for
         a G <br /> Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death <br /> My <span class="profanity">niggas</span>, we the last ones left, but life goes
         on <br /> How many brothers fell victim to the streets? <br /> Rest in peace, young <span class="profanity">nigga</span>, there's a heaven for
         a G <br /> Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death <br /> My <span class="profanity">niggas</span>, we the last ones left, but life goes
         on <br />  <br />  <br /> Bury me smilin' with G's in my pocket <br /> Have a party at my funeral, let every rapper rock it <br /> Let the <span class="dt">hoes</span> that I used to know <br /> From way befo' kiss me from my head to my toe <br /> Give me a paper and a pen, so I can write about my life of sin <br /> A couple bottles of gin, in case I don't get in <br /> Tell all my people I'm a Ridah <br /> Nobody cries when we die, we Outlawz, let me ride <br /> Until I get free <br /> I live my life in the fast lane, got police chasin' me <br /> To my <span class="profanity">niggas</span> from old blocks, from old
         crews <br /> <span class="profanity">Niggas</span> that guided me through back in the old
         school <br /> Pour out some liquor, have a toast for the homies <br /> See, we both gotta die, but you chose to go before me <br /> And brothers miss you while you gone <br /> You left your <span class="profanity">nigga</span> on his own; how long we
         mourn? Life goes on <br />  <br />  <br /> Life goes on, homie <br /> Gone on, 'cause they passed away <br /> <span class="profanity">Niggas</span> doin' life <br /> <span class="profanity">Niggas</span> doin' 50 and 60 years and <span class="profanity">shit</span> <br /> I feel you, <span class="profanity">nigga</span>! Trust me, I feel you <br /> You know what I mean? <br /> Last year we poured out liquor for ya <br /> This year, <span class="profanity">nigga</span>, life goes on <br /> We're gonna clock now <br /> Get money, evade <span class="profanity">bitches</span>, evade tricks <br /> Give playa haters plenty of space <br /> And basically just represent for you, baby <br /> Next time you see your <span class="profanity">niggas</span>, we gon' be on
         top, <span class="profanity">nigga</span> <br /> You gon' be like, "Goddamn, them <span class="profanity">niggas</span> came
         up!" <br /> That's right, baby, life goes on <br /> And we up out this <span class="profanity">bitch</span> <br /> Hey, Kato! Mental! <br /> Y'all <span class="profanity">niggas</span> make sure it's poppin' <br /> When we get up there, man, don't front <br /> Life goes on <br /> Hold me no more, hold me no more <br /> Yes it do, yes it do, yes it do <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />
