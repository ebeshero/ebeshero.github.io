         <h1>Song Title: Still Don't Give a Fuck</h1>
         <h2>Artist: Eminem</h2>
         <h4>Producer: Eminem and Bass Brothers</h4>
         <h4>Album: The Slim Shady LP</h4>
         <h4>Certification: Diamond</h4> <br /> A lot of people ask me, am I <span class="emotion">afraid</span> of
         death? <br /> <span class="profanity">Hell</span> yeah, I'm <span class="emotion">afraid</span> of death <br /> I don't want to die yet <br /> A lot of people think that I worship the devil <br /> That I do all types of retarded <span class="profanity">shit</span> <br /> Look, I can't change the way I think <br /> And I can't change the way I am <br /> But if I offended you, good! <br /> ‘Cause I still don't give a <span class="profanity">fuck</span> <br />  <br />  <br /> I'm zonin' off of one joint, stoppin' a limo <br /> Hopped in the window, shoppin' a demo at gunpoint <br /> A lyricist without a clue, what year is this? <br /> <span class="profanity">Fuck</span> a needle, here's a sword, body pierce with
         this! <br /> Livin' amok, never givin' a <span class="profanity">fuck</span> <br /> Give me the keys, I'm drunk, and I've never driven a truck <br /> But I smoke dope in a cab <br /> I'll stab you with the sharpest knife I can grab <br /> Come back the next week and re-open your scab <br /> A killer instinct runs in the blood <br /> Emptyin' full clips and buryin' guns in the mud <br /> I've calmed down now, I was heavy once into drugs <br /> I could walk around straight for two months with a buzz <br /> My brain's gone, my soul's worn, and my spirit is torn <br /> The rest of my body's still bein' operated on <br /> I'm ducked the <span class="profanity">fuck</span> down while I'm writin' this
         rhyme <br /> ‘Cause I'm probably gonna get struck with lightnin' this time <br />  <br />  <br /> For all the weed that I've smoked – yo, this blunt's for you <br /> To all the people I've offended – yeah, <span class="profanity">fuck</span> you
         too! <br /> To all the friends I used to have – yo, I miss my past <br /> But the rest of you <span class="profanity">assholes</span> can kiss my <span class="profanity">ass</span> <br /> For all the drugs that I've done – yo, I'm still gonna do <br /> To all the people I've offended – yeah, <span class="profanity">fuck</span> you
         too! <br /> For every time I reminisce – yo, I miss my past <br /> But I still don't give a <span class="profani             ty">fuck</span>,
         y'all can kiss my <span class="profanity">ass</span> <br />  <br />  <br /> I walked into a gunfight with a knife to kill you <br /> And cut you so fast, when your blood spilled it was still blue <br /> I'll hang you till you dangle and chain you with both ankles <br /> And pull you apart from both angles <br /> I wanna crush your skull 'til your brains leaks out of your veins and bust open
         like broken water mains <br /> So tell Saddam not to bother with makin' another bomb <br /> ‘Cause I'm crushin' the whole world in my palm <br /> Got your girl on my arm, and I'm armed with a firearm <br /> So big my entire arm is a giant firebomb <br /> Buy your mom a shirt with a Slim Shady iron-on <br /> And the pants to match ("Here, Momma, try 'em on!") <br /> I get imaginative with a mouth full of adjectives <br /> A brain full of adverbs, and a box full of laxatives <br /> (<span class="profanity">Shittin'</span> on rappers) Causing hospital
         accidents <br /> God, help me, before I commit some irresponsible acts again <br />  <br />  <br /> For all the weed that I've smoked – yo, this blunt's for you <br /> To all the people I've offended – yeah, <span class="profanity">fuck</span> you
         too! <br /> To all the friends I used to have – yo, I miss my past <br /> But the rest of you <span class="profanity">assholes</span> can kiss my <span class="profanity">ass</span> <br /> For all the drugs that I've done – yo, I'm still gonna do <br /> To all the people I've offended – yeah, <span class="profanity">fuck</span> you
         too! <br /> For every time I reminisce – yo, I miss my past <br /> But I still don't give a <span class="profani                 ty">fuck</span>,
         y'all can kiss my <span class="profanity">ass</span> <br />  <br />  <br /> I wanted an album so rugged nobody could touch it <br /> <span class="lifeEvent">Spent a million a track and went over my
            budget</span> <br /> Now how in the <span class="profanity">fuck</span> am I supposed to get out of
         debt? <br /> I can't rap anymore, I just murdered the alphabet <br /> Drug sickness got me doin' some bugged twitches <br /> I'm withdrawin' from crack so bad my blood itches <br /> I don't rap to get the women—<span class="profanity">fuck</span>
         <span class="dt">bitches</span>! <br /> Give me a fat <span class="dt">slut</span> that cooks and does dishes <br /> Never ran with a clique, I'm a posse <br /> Kamikaze, strappin' a <span class="profanity">motherfuckin'</span> bomb across
         me <br /> From the second I was born my momma lost me <br /> I'm a cross between Manson, Esham and Ozzy <br /> I don't know why the <span class="profanity">fuck</span> I'm here in the first
         place <br /> My worst day on this earth was my first birthday <br /> Retarded? What did that nurse say? <br /> Brain damage? <span class="profanity">Fuck</span>! I was born during an
         earthquake <br />  <br />  <br /> For all the weed that I've smoked – yo, this blunt's for you <br /> To all the people I've offended – yeah, <span class="profanity">fuck</span> you
         too! <br /> To all the friends I used to have – yo, I miss my past <br /> But the rest of you <span class="profanity">assholes</span> can kiss my <span class="profanity">ass</span> <br /> For all the drugs that I've done – yo, I'm still gonna do <br /> To all the people I've offended – yeah, <span class="profanity">fuck</span> you
         too! <br /> For every time I reminisce – yo, I miss my past <br /> But I still don't give a <span class="profani                     ty">fuck</span>, y'all can kiss my <span class="profanity">ass</span> <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />
