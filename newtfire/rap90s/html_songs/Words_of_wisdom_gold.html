         <h1>Song Title: Words of Wisdom</h1>
         <h2>Artist: 2Pac</h2>
         <h4>Producer: Produced by 2Pac and Shock G</h4>
         <h4>Album: 2Pacalypse Now</h4>
         <h4>Certification: Gold</h4> <br /> Killing us one by one <br /> In one way or another <br /> America will find a way to eliminate the problem <br /> One by one <br /> The problem is the troublesome black youth of the ghetto's <br /> And one by one <br /> We are being wiped off the face of this earth <br /> At an extremly alarming rate <br /> And even more alarming is the fact <br /> That we are not fighting back <br /> Brothers, sisters, <span class="profanity">niggas</span> <br /> When I say "<span class="profanity">nigga</span>" it is not the <span class="profanity">nigga</span> we have grown to fear <br /> It is not the <span class="profanity">nigga</span> we say as if it has no
         meaning <br /> But to me it means Never Ignorant Getting Goals Accomplished, <span class="profanity">nigga</span> <br /> <span class="profanity">Niggas</span>, what are we going to do? <br /> Walk blind into a line or fight <br /> Fight and die if we must die, like <span class="profanity">niggas</span> <br />  <br />  <br /> This is for the masses, the lower classes <br /> The ones you left out, jobs were giving, better living <br /> But we were kept out <br /> Made to feel inferior, but we're superior <br /> Break the chains in our brains that made us fear ya <br /> Pledge allegiance to a flag that neglects us <br /> Honour a man that that refuses to respect us <br /> Emancipation Proclamation? Please! <br /> Lincoln just said that to save the nation <br /> These are lies that we all accepted <br /> Say no to drugs but the governments' kept it <br /> Running through our community, killing the unity <br /> The war on drugs is a war on you and me <br /> And yet, they say this is the Home of The Free <br /> But if you ask me, it's all about hypocrisy <br /> The constitution, yo, it don't apply to me <br /> And Lady Liberty? Stupid <span class="profanity">bitch</span> lied to me <br /> This made me strong, and no one's gonna like what I'm pumpin' <br /> But its wrong to keep someone from learning something <br /> So get up, its time to start nation building <br /> I'm fed up, we gotta start teach the children <br /> That they can be all that they wanna to be <br /> There's much more to life than just poverty <br />  <br />  <br /> This is definitely uh... words of wisdom <br /> AMERICA! AMERICA! AMERIK-K-KA <br /> I charge you with the crime of rape, murder, and assault <br /> For suppressing and punishing my people <br /> I charge you with robbery for robbing me of my history <br /> I charge you with false imprisonment for keeping me <br /> Trapped in the projects <br /> And the jury finds you guilty on all accounts <br /> And you are to serve the consequences of your evil schemes <br /> Prosecutor, do you have any more evidence? <br />  <br />  <br /> Words of Wisdom <br /> Based upon the strength of a nation <br /> Conquer the enemy armed with education <br /> Protect yourself, reach for what you want to do <br /> Know thyself, teach by what we've been through <br /> Armed with the knowledge of the place we've been <br /> No one will ever oppress this race again <br /> No Malcolm X in my history text, why's that? <br /> ’Cause he tried to educate and liberate all blacks <br /> Why is Martin Luther King in my book each week? <br /> He told blacks, if they get smacked, turn the other cheek <br /> I don't get it, so many questions went through my mind <br /> I get sweated, they act like asking questions is a crime <br /> But forget it, cause one day I'm gonna prove them wrong <br /> Not every brother had his mother on the welfare line <br /> The American Dream, though it seems like it's attainable <br /> They're pulling your sleeve, don't believe <br /> ’Cause it will strangle ya <br /> Pulling the life of your brain, I can't explain <br /> Beg as you can obtain from which you came <br /> Swear that your mother is living in equality <br /> Forgetting your brother that's living in poverty <br /> Thought they had us beaten when they took out King <br /> But the battle ain't over till the black man sings <br /> Words of Wisdom <br /> The battle ain't over 'till the black man sings <br /> Words of Wisdom <br />  <br />  <br /> NIGHTMARE! That's what I am <br /> America's Nightmare <br /> I am what you made me <br /> The hate and the evil that you gave me <br /> I shine as a reminder of what you've done to my people <br /> For four hundred plus years <br /> You should be scared <br /> You should be running <br /> You should be trying to silence me <br /> Ha, but you can not escape fate <br /> For it is my turn to come <br /> Just as you rose you will fall <br /> By my hands <br /> America, you reap what you sow <br /> 2Pacalypse, America's Nightmare <br /> Ice Cube and Da Lynch Mob, America's Nightmare <br /> Above The Law, America's Nightmare <br /> Paris, America's Nightmare <br /> Public Enemy, America's Nightmare <br /> KRS-One, America's Nightmare <br /> New Afrikan Panthers, America's nightmare <br /> Mutulu Shakur, America's Nightmare <br /> Geronimo Pratt, America's Nightmare <br /> Assata Shakur, America's Nightmare <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />
