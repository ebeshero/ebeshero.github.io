         jackin' <br /> I see no justice, all I see is <span class="profanity">niggas</span> dying
         fast <br /> The sound of a gun blast, then watch the hearse pass <br /> Just another day in the life, G <br /> Gotta step lightly, cause cops tried to snipe me <br /> The cabs, they don't wanna stop for a brother, man <br /> But <span class="profanity">damn</span> near have an accident to pick up
         another man <br /> I went to the bank to cash my check <br /> I get more respect from the <span class="profanity">mothafucking</span> dope
