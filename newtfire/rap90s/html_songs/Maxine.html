         tryna clear it <br />  <br />  <br /> Featured Singer: Kon Artis <br />  <br /> Sometimes I wonder, what's your purpose in life? <br /> That is to get with every brother <br /> And unveil one of his kids <br /> <span class="profanity">Shit</span>, you livin' trife <br /> Got three kids at home, and club-hoppin' every night <br /> You say it's gonna stop <br /> But it just… slows… down… <br /> And then speeds back to a regular pace <br /> There is no end to this <br /> Mystery, whatever your reason even is to be <br /> <span class="lifeEvent">You say you wanna be with me, but how can you say
            that</span> <br /> When you got <span class="profanity">niggas</span> hidin' in your
         closet? <br /> I refrain from gettin' <span class="emotion">angry</span> <br /> But you keep on actin' strangely <br />  <br />  <br /> Featured Singer: Three <br />  <br /> I met this girl last week <br /> She was a <span class="profanity">freak</span>, and she liked me <br /> So I stepped on it and then asked my homies <br /> And chilled on the side and then watched they <span class="profanity">niggas</span> <br /> Big game over there and take notes, while I get this number <br /> I stepped to her, first I cleared my throat <br /> And said: "Hey, <span class="dt">bitch</span>, haven't I seen you
         before?" <br /> Looked at my <span class="profanity">nigga</span>, turned around and got
         slapped <br /> Throughout my hands, and said: "Oh, it's like that?" <br /> She said she just broke up with her <span class="profanity">nigga</span> and
         <span class="profanity">shit</span> <br /> She started cryin', and asked me to forgive her and <span class="profanity">shit</span> <br /> She said her name was Maxine <br /> So I told her I wanted her number <br /> She asked could I give her mine too <br /> Got to the crib and called her up <br /> We got into a good conversation <br /> That's when she asked me could I fuck <br /> I said: "Maxine, check this out <br /> Give me your address I'll be through and you'll find out." <br /> Got to the crib, she let me in <br /> She didn't waste time, she grabbed my hand <br /> And proceeded to the bedroom <br /> I said "Hold up, and stop proceedin', you rushin' things" <br /> What the <span class="profanity">fuck</span> are you doin'? <br /> So I went for my protection <br /> Took off my clothes and started flexin' <br /> As she went for my midsection <br /> I threw her down as I tore off her shirt <br /> Pulled out my jimmy and I thought about puttin' in work <br /> Before I hit it she said: "3, don't get mad <br /> But there's somethin' that I gotta tell your <span class="profanity">ass</span>." <br /> I said "What is it? Another <span class="profanity">nigga</span>? It's
         okay." <br /> She said: "No I forgot to tell you <br /> That I got AIDS, I got a problem." <br />  <br />  <br /> Featured Singer: Maxine <br />  <br /> Featured Singer: Denaun Porter <br />  <br /> Hey, Maxine <br /> What? <br /> You thinkin' about suckin' my dick? <br /> Yeah, for a small price <br /> For a small price? What you mean? <br /> You know, money, <span class="profanity">nigga</span> <br /> You don't need no damn money; I can't give you no money anyways, I heard you got
         some <span class="profanity">shit</span> <br /> What you, what you hear I got? <br /> AIDS <br /> Who told you that <span class="profanity">bullshit</span>? <br /> My <span class="profanity">nigga</span> Kyu, he wouldn't lie <br /> Well, if that's the case, Kyu got it then <br /> Oh for real, it's like that? <br /> Well, I ain't got <span class="profanity">shit</span>, so he ain't got <span class="profanity">shit</span> <br /> And if he do, he ain't get that <span class="profanity">shit</span> from
         me <br /> I ain't <span class="profanity">fuckin'</span> around with no third <span class="profanity">nigga</span> <br /> <span class="profanity">Fuck</span> that, I ain't <span class="profanity">fuckin'</span> with you <br /> No, see… <br /> You got that <span class="profanity">shit</span>, I ain't gotta <span class="profanity">fuck</span> with you <br /> Hold on, why it ain't even like that <br /> I want y'all to get paid, <span class="profanity">fuckin'</span> <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />
