         <h1>Song Title: Rock Bottom</h1>
         <h2>Artist: Eminem</h2>
         <h4>Producer: Bass Brothers</h4>
         <h4>Album: The Slim Shady LP</h4>
         <h4>Certification: Diamond</h4> <br /> Ayo, this song is dedicated <br /> To all the happy people <br /> All the happy people <br /> Who have real nice lives <br /> And have no idea <br /> What it's like to be broke as <span class="profanity">fuck</span> <br />  <br />  <br /> I feel like I'm walkin' a tight rope without a circus net <br /> Poppin' Percocet, I'm a nervous wreck <br /> I deserve respect but I work a sweat for this worthless check <br /> I'm about to burst this TEC at somebody to reverse this debt <br /> Minimum wage got my adrenaline caged <br /> Full of venom and <span class="emotion">rage</span>, especially when I'm
         engaged <br /> And my daughter's down to her last diaper, it's got my <span class="profanity">ass</span> hyper <br /> I pray that God answers — maybe I'll ask nicer <br /> Watchin' ballers while they're flossin' in their Pathfinders <br /> These overnight stars becomin' autograph-signers <br /> We all long to blow up and leave the past behind us <br /> Along with the small fries and average half-pinters <br /> But player-haters turnin' <span class="dt">bitch</span> like they have
         vaginas <br /> ‘Cause we see them dollar signs and let the cash blind us <br /> Money'll brainwash you and leave yo' <span class="profanity">ass</span>
         mindless <br /> Them snakes slither in the grass spineless <br />  <br />  <br /> That's rock bottom <br /> When this life makes you <span class="profanity">mad</span> enough to
         kill <br /> That's rock bottom <br /> When you want somethin' bad enough to steal <br /> That's rock bottom <br /> When you feel like you've had it up to here <br /> ‘Cause you're <span class="profanity">mad</span> enough to scream <br /> But you're <span class="profanity">sad</span> enough to tear <br />  <br />  <br /> My life is full of empty promises and broken dreams <br /> I'm hopin' things look up, but there ain't no job openings <br /> I feel <span class="emotion">discouraged</span>, hungry and malnourished <br /> <span class="lifeEvent">Livin' in this house with no furnace,
            unfurnished</span> <br /> And I'm sick of workin' dead-end jobs with lame pay <br /> And I'm tired of bein' hired and fired the same day <br /> But <span class="profanity">fuck</span> it — if you know the rules to the game,
         play! <br /> ‘Cause when we die, we know we all goin' the same way <br /> ‘Cause it's cool to be the player, but it sucks to be the fan <br /> When all you need is bucks to be the man, plus a luxury sedan <br /> Or comfortable and roomy in a 6 <br /> But they threw me in the mix with all these gloomy lunatics <br /> Who walk around <span class="emotion">depressed</span>, and smoke a pound of
         cess a day <br /> And yesterday went by so quick it seems like it was just today <br /> My daughter wants to throw the ball, but I'm too stressed to play <br /> Live half my life and throw the rest away <br />  <br />  <br /> That's rock bottom <br /> When this life makes you <span class="emotion">mad</span> enough to kill <br /> That's rock bottom <br /> When you want somethin' bad enough to steal <br /> That's rock bottom <br /> When you feel like you've had it up to here <br /> ‘Cause you're <span class="emotion">mad</span> enough to scream <br /> But you're <span class="emotion">sad</span> enough to tear <br />  <br />  <br /> There's people that love me and people that hate me <br /> But it's the evil that made me <br /> This backstabbin', deceitful and shady <br /> I want the money, the women, the fortune and fame <br /> If it means I end up burnin' in Hell, scorchin' in flames <br /> If it means I'm stealin' your checkbook and forgin' your name <br /> This lifetime bliss for eternal torture and pain <br /> ‘Cause right now, I feel like I've just hit the rock bottom <br /> I've got problems — now everybody on my block's got 'em <br /> I'm screamin' like them two cops when 2Pac shot 'em <br /> Holdin' two Glocks, hope your doors got new locks on 'em <br /> My daughter's feet ain't got no shoes or socks on 'em <br /> And them rings you wearin' look like they got a few rocks on 'em <br /> And while you flaunt 'em <br /> I could be takin' 'em to shops to pawn 'em <br /> I got a couple of rings and a brand-new watch — you want 'em? <br /> ‘Cause I ain't never went gold off one song <br /> I'm runnin' up on someone's lawn, with guns drawn <br />  <br />  <br /> That's rock bottom <br /> When this life makes you <span class="emotion">mad</span> enough to kill <br /> That's rock bottom <br /> When you want somethin' bad enough to steal <br /> That's rock bottom <br /> When you feel like you've had it up to here <br /> ‘Cause you're <span class="emotion">mad</span> enough to scream <br /> But you're <span class="emotion">sad</span> enough to tear <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />
