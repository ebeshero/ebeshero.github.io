         style from <br /> You ain't gon' sell two copies if you press a double album <br /> Admit it, <span class="profanity">fuck</span> it, while we comin' out in the
         open <br /> I'm doin' acid, crack, smack, coke and smokin' dope then <br /> My name is Marshall Mathers, I'm an alcoholic (hi, Marshall) <br /> I have a disease, and they don't know what to call it <br /> Better hide your wallet, ‘cause I'm comin' up quick to strip yo' cash <br /> Bought a ticket to yo' concert just to come and whip yo' <span class="profanity">ass</span> <br /> Bitch, I'm comin' out swingin', so fast it'll make yo' eyes spin <br /> You gettin' knocked the <span class="profanity">fuck</span> out like Mike
         Tyson <br /> The proof is in the pudding, just ask DeShaun Holton <br /> I'll slit your <span class="profanity">motherfuckin'</span> throat worse than
         Ron Goldman <br />  <br />  <br /> So when you see me on yo' block with two Glocks <br /> Screamin', "<span class="profanity">Fuck</span> the world!" like 2Pac <br /> I just don't give a <span class="profanity">fuck</span> <br /> Talkin' that <span class="profanity">shit</span> behind my back <br /> Dirty mackin', tellin' your boys that I'm on crack <br /> I just don't give a <span class="profanity">fuck</span> <br /> So put my tape back on the rack <br /> Go run and tell your friends my <span class="profanity">shit</span> is
         wack <br /> I just don't give a <span class="profanity">fuck</span> <br /> But see me on the street and duck <br /> ‘Cause you gon' get stuck, stole, and snuffed <br /> ‘Cause I just don't give a <span class="profanity">fuck</span> <br />  <br />  <br /> I'm nicer than Pete, but I'm on a search to crush a milkbone <br /> I'm everlastin', I melt vanilla ice like silicone <br /> I'm ill enough to just straight up diss you for no reason <br /> I'm colder than snow season when it's 20 below freezin' <br /> Flavor with no seasonin', this is the sneak preview <br /> I'll diss your magazine and still won't get a weak review <br /> I'll make your <span class="dt">freak</span> leave you, smell the Folgers
         crystals <br /> This is lyrical combat—gentlemen, hold your pistols! <br /> But I form like Voltron and blast you with my shoulder missiles <br /> Slim Shady; Eminem was the old initials (bye bye!) <br /> Extortion, snortin', supportin' abortion <br /> Pathological liar, blowin' shit out of proportion <br /> The looniest, zaniest, spontaneous, sporadic <br /> Impulsive thinker, compulsive drinker, addict <br /> Half animal, half man <br /> Dumpin' yo' dead body inside of a <span class="profanity">fuckin'</span> trash
         can <br /> With more holes than an afghan <br />  <br />  <br /> So when you see me on yo' block with two Glocks <br /> Screamin', "<span class="profanity">Fuck</span> the world!" like 2Pac <br /> I just don't give a <span class="profanity">fuck</span> <br /> Talkin' that <span class="profanity">shit</span> behind my back <br /> Dirty mackin', tellin' your boys that I'm on crack <br /> I just don't give a <span class="profanity">fuck</span> <br /> So put my tape back on the rack <br /> Go run and tell your friends my <span class="profanity">shit</span> is
         wack <br /> I just don't give a <span class="profanity">fuck</span> <br /> But see me on the street and duck <br /> ‘Cause you finna get stuck, stole, and snuffed <br /> I just don't give a <span class="profanity">fuck</span> <br />  <br />  <br /> Somebody, let me out this limousine! I'm a caged demon <br /> On stage screamin' like Rage Against the Machine <br /> I'm convinced I'm a fiend <br /> Shootin' up while this record is spinnin' <br /> Clinically brain-dead, I don't need a second opinion <br /> <span class="profanity">Fuck</span> droppin' a jewel, I'm flippin' a sacred
         treasure <br /> I'll bite yo' <span class="profanity">motherfuckin'</span> style, just to make
         it fresher <br /> I can't take the pressure, I'm sick of <span class="dt">bitches</span> <br /> Sick of naggin' bosses <span class="profanity">bitchin'</span> while I'm
         washin' dishes <br /> In school I never said much, too busy havin' a headrush <br /> Doin' too much rush had my face flushed like red blush <br /> Then I went to Jim Beam, that's when my face grayed <br /> Went to gym in 8th grade, raped the women's swim team <br /> Don't take me for a joke, I'm no comedian <br /> Too many mental problems got me snortin' coke and smokin' weed again <br /> I'm goin' up over the curb, drivin' on the median <br /> Finally made it home, but I don't got the key to get in <br />  <br />  <br /> So when you see me on yo' block with two Glocks <br /> Screamin', "<span class="profanity">Fuck</span> the world!" like 2Pac <br /> I just don't give a <span class="profanity">fuck</span> <br /> Talkin' that <span class="profanity">shit</span> behind my back <br /> Dirty mackin', tellin' your boys that I'm on crack <br /> I just don't give a <span class="profanity">fuck</span> <br /> So put my tape back on the rack <br /> Go run and tell your friends my <span class="profanity">shit</span> is
         wack <br /> I just don't give a <span class="profanity">fuck</span> <br /> But see me on the street and duck <br /> ‘Cause you finna get stuck, stole, and snuffed <br /> I just don't give a <span class="profanity">fuck</span> <br />  <br />  <br /> <span class="profanity">Shit</span>, <span class="profanity">fuck</span>
