         <span class="profanity">motherfuckers</span> love it <br /> To be a soldier, must maintain composure at ease <br /> Though life is complicated, only what you make it to be <br /> Uh, and my ambitions as a ridah <br /> To catch her while she hot and horny, go up inside her <br /> Then I spit some game in her ear, "Go to the telly, <span class="dt">hoe</span>!" <br /> Equipped with money in a Benz ‘cause, <span class="profanity">bitch</span>, I'm
         barely broke <br /> I'm smokin' <span class="profanity">bomb-ass</span> weed, feelin'
         crucial <br /> From player to player the game's tight, the feeling's mutual <br /> From hustlin' and prayers to breakin' <span class="profanity">motherfuckers</span> to pay up <br /> I got no time for these <span class="profanity">bitches</span>, ‘cause these
         <span class="dt">hoes</span> try to play us <br /> I'm on a meal ticket mission, want a mill, so I'm wishin' <br /> Competition got me ripped on that <span class="profanity">bullshit</span> they
         stressin' <br /> I'ma rhyme though, clown hoes like it's mandatory <br /> No guts, no glory, my <span class="profanity">nigga</span>, <span class="profanity">bitch</span> got the game distorted <br /> Now it's on and it's on because I said so <br /> Can't trust a <span class="profanity">bitch</span> in the business, <span class="lifeEvent">so I got with Death Row</span>
          <br /> Now these money-hungry bitches gettin' suspicious <br /> Started plottin' and plannin' on schemes to come and trick us <br /> But thug niggas be on point and game tight <br /> Me, Syke and Bogart strapped up the same night <br /> Got problems, then handle it, <span class="profanity">motherfuckers</span> see
         me <br /> These <span class="profanity">niggas</span> is <span class="emotion">jealous</span> <br /> ‘Cause deep in they heart they wanna be me <br /> Uh, yeah, and now you got me right beside ya, hopin' you listen <br /> I catch you payin' attention to my ambitions as a ridah <br />  <br />  <br /> I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah <br /> You don't wanna <span class="profanity">fuck</span> with me <br /> Got the police bustin' at me <br /> But they can't do nothin' to a G <br /> Let's get ready to rumble <br />  <br />  <br /> It was my only wish to rise <br /> Above these <span class="emotion">jealous</span> coward <span class="profanity">motherfuckers</span> I despise <br /> When it's time to ride I was the first off this side, give me the 9 <br /> I'm ready to die right here tonight and <span class="profanity">motherfuck</span> they life <br /> That's what they screamin' as they drill me, but I'm hard to kill <br /> (That's all you <span class="profanity">niggas</span> got?!) <br /> So open fire, I see you kill me, witness my steel <br /> Spittin' at adversaries, <span class="emotion">envious</span> and after
         me <br /> I'd rather die before they capture me, watch me bleed <br /> Mama, come rescue me, I'm suicidal, thinkin' thoughts <br /> I'm innocent, so there'll be bullets flyin' when I'm caught <br /> (Shoot!) <span class="profanity">Fuck</span> doin' jail time, better day,
         sacrificin' <br /> Won't get a chance to do me like they did my <span class="profanity">nigga</span> Tyson <br /> Thuggin' for life, and if you right, then <span class="profanity">nigga</span>
         die for it <br /> Let them other brothers try, at least you tried for it <br /> When it's time to die, to be a man and pick the way you leave <br /> <span class="profanity">Fuck</span> peace and the police, my ambitions as a
         ridah <br />  <br />  <br /> I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah <br /> You don't wanna <span class="profanity">fuck</span> with me <br /> Got the police bustin' at me <br /> But they can't do nothin' to a G <br /> Let's get ready to rumble <br />  <br />  <br /> My murderous lyrics, equipped with spirits of the thugs before me <br /> <span class="lifeEvent">Pay off the block, evade the cops ‘cause I know they
            comin' for me</span> <br /> I been hesitant to reappear, been away for years <br /> Now I'm back, my adversaries been reduced to tears <br /> Question my methods to switch up speeds <br /> Sure as some <span class="profanity">bitches</span> bleed <br /> <span class="profanity">Niggas'll</span> feel the fire of my mother's corrupted
         seed <br /> Blast me, but they didn't finish, didn't diminish my powers <br /> (Buck buck buck buck buck!) <br /> So now I'm back to be a <span class="profanity">motherfuckin'</span> menace,
         they cowards <br /> That's why they tried to set me up <br /> Had <span class="profanity">bitch-ass niggas</span> on my team, so indeed they
         wet me up <br /> But I'm back reincarnated, incarcerated <br /> At the time I contemplate the way that God made it <br /> Lace'em with lyrics that's legendary, musical mercenary <br /> For money I'll have these <span class="profanity">motherfuckers</span>
         buried <br /> I been gettin' much mail in jail, niggas tellin' me to kill it <br /> Knowin' when I get out they gon' feel it <br /> Witness the realest! A hoo-ridah when I put the <span class="profanity">shit</span> inside <br /> The cry from all your people when they find her <br /> Just remind ya, my history'll prove authentic <br /> Revenge on them <span class="profanity">niggas</span> that played me <br /> And all the cowards that was down with it <br /> Now it's your <span class="profanity">nigga</span> right beside ya, hopin' you
         listenin' <br /> Catch you payin' attention to my ambitions as a ridah <br />  <br />  <br /> I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah <br /> You don't wanna <span class="profanity">fuck</span> with me <br /> Got the police bustin' at me <br /> But they can't do nothin' to a G <br /> Let's get ready to rumble <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />
