         <h4>Certification: Gold</h4> <br /> Ever since you was a pee-wee, down by my knee with a wee-wee <br /> We been coochie-coo all through school, you and me, G <br /> Back in the days we played practical jokes on <br /> Everybody smoked with they locs and they yokes on <br /> <span class="lifeEvent">All through high school, girls by the
            dozens</span> <br /> <span class="lifeEvent">Saying we cousins, knowing that we wasn't</span> <br /> But like the old saying goes <br /> Times goes on, and everybody grows <br /> Grew apart, had to part, went our own ways <br /> You chose the dope game, my microphone pays <br /> In many ways we were paid in the old days <br /> So far away from the crazies with AK's <br /> And though I been around clowning with the Underground <br /> I'm still down with my homies from the hometown <br /> And if you need, need anything at all <br /> I drop it all for y'all, if my homies call <br />  <br />  <br /> "If you ever need a place to stay" <br /> “Well, alright, y'all” <br /> “Brothers and sisters” <br />  <br />  <br /> It's a shame, you chose the dope game <br /> Now you slang 'caine on the streets with no name <br /> It was plain that your aim was mo' 'caine <br /> You got game now you run with no shame <br /> I chose rapping tracks to make stacks <br /> In fact I travel the map with raps that spray cats <br /> But now I don't wanna down my homie <br /> No matter how low you go, you're not lowly <br /> And I, hear that you made a few enemies <br /> But when you need a friend you can depend on me, call <br /> If you need my assistance, there'll be no resistance <br /> I'll be there in an instant <br /> Who am I to judge another brother, only on his cover <br /> I'd be no different than the other <br /> H-to-the-O-to-the-M-to-the-I-to-the-E <br /> I'm down to the E-N-D <br /> Cause it's a fall in no time at all <br /> I'm down for y'all, when my homies call <br /> Word, if my homies call <br />  <br />  <br /> "If you ever need a place to stay" <br /> “Well, alright, y'all” <br /> “Brothers and sisters” <br />  <br />  <br /> Well, it's ninety-one and I'm living kinda swell now <br /> But I hear that you're going through some hell, pal <br /> But life making records ain't easy <br /> It ain't what I expected, it's hectic, it's sleazy <br /> But I guess that the streets is harder <br /> Trying to survive in the life of a young godfather <br /> My homies is making it elsewhere <br /> Striving, working nine to five with no health care <br /> We both had dreams of being great <br /> But his deferred and blurred and changed in shape <br /> It's fate, it wasn't my choice to make <br /> To be great, I'm giving it all it takes <br /> Trying to shake, the crates and fakes and snakes <br /> I gotta take my place or fall from grace <br /> The foolish way, the pace is quick and great <br /> Smiling face to hide the trace of hate <br /> But my homie would never do me wrong <br /> <span class="lifeEvent">That's why I wrote this song, if you ever need me, it's
            on</span> <br /> No matter who the foe they must fall <br /> Us against them all I'm down to brawl if my homies call <br />  <br />  <br /> "If you ever need a place to stay" <br /> “Well, alright, y'all” <br /> “Brothers and sisters” <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />
