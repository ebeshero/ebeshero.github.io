Yo, I done heard worse <br /> We can get in two cars and accelerate at each other <br /> To see which one'll swerve first <br /> Two blind bandits panic whose mental capacity holds that of a globe on top of nine
         other planets <br /> Kissed the cheek of the Devil <br /> Intelligence level is hellier than treble peakin' <br /> On speakers in the ghetto <br /> Dismissal, I'm not a fair man <br /> Disgraced the race of an atheist <br /> Interceptin' missiles with my bare hands like a patriot <br /> One track sliced without swords <br /> I buried the Christ corpse, in my past life <br /> When the black knight mounted the white horse <br /> And stay over-worked <br /> It's like the Nazis and the Nation <br /> Collaboratin', attemptin' to take over the Earth <br />  <br />  <br /> Singer: Eminem <br />  <br /> ‘Cause this is what happens when Bad meets Evil <br /> And we hit the trees 'til we look like Vietnamese people <br /> He's Evil, and I'm Bad like Steve Seagal <br /> Above the law ‘cause I don't agree with police either <br /> (<span class="profanity">Shit</span>, me neither) <br />  <br />  <br /> Singer: Eminem <br />  <br /> We ain't eager to be legal <br /> So please leave me with the keys to your Jeep Eagle <br /> I breathe ether in three lethal amounts <br /> While I stab myself in the knee with a diseased needle <br /> Releasin' <span class="emotion">rage</span> on anybody in squeezin'
         range <br /> Cold enough to make the seasons change into freezin' rain <br /> (He's insane) No I'm not, I just want to shoot up <br /> And I'm pissed off, ‘cause I can't find a decent vein <br />  <br />  <br /> Featured Singer: Royce da 5'9" <br />  <br /> The disaster with dreads <br /> I'm bad enough to commit suicide <br /> And survive long enough to kill my soul after I'm dead <br /> When in danger, it's funny <br /> Actually my flavor's similar to a waiter <br /> ‘Cause I serve any stranger with money <br /> I spray a hundred <br /> Man, until they joint chains, while slippin' bullets at point-blank range like
         they was punches <br /> Piss on a flag and burn it <br /> Murder you then come to your funeral <br /> Service lobby and strangle your body to confirm it <br /> Whippin' human <span class="profanity">ass</span>, throwin' blows, crackin'
         jaws <br /> With my fists wrapped in gauze, dipped in glue and glass <br /> I'm blazin' emcees, at the same time amazin' emcees <br /> Somehow, emcees ain't that eyebrow-raisin' to me <br /> From all of angles of us, flash a MAC loud enough <br /> To cast a avalanche and bust 'til volcanoes erupt <br />  <br />  <br /> Singer: Eminem <br />  <br /> Hello? Ayo, what’s up? <br /> We’re coming to get you! <br /> Stop! THEY KNOW IT’S US!!! <br />  <br />  <br /> Singer: Eminem <br />  <br /> I used to be a loudmouth, remember me? <br /> I'm the one who burned your house down, well, I'm out now <br /> And this time I'm comin' back to blow your house up <br /> And I ain't gon' leave you a window to jump out of <br /> Give me two fat tabs and three shrooms <br /> And you won't see me, like fat people in steam rooms <br /> And when I go to hell and I'm gettin' ready to leave <br /> I'ma put air in a bag and charge people to breathe <br />  <br />  <br /> Featured Singer: Royce da 5'9" <br />  <br /> ‘Cause this is what happens when Bad meets Evil <br /> And we hit the trees 'til we look like Vietnamese people <br /> He's Evil, and I'm Bad like Steve Seagal <br /> Against peaceful, see you in Hell for the sequel <br /> (We'll be waiting) See you in Hell <br /> Wall Street, Royce Da 5'9", Slim Shady <br /> See you in Hell for the sequel (bye-bye) <br /> Bad Meets Evil, what ('til next time) <br />  <br />  <br /> Featured Singer: Jeff Bass <br />  <br /> And so that's the story when Bad meets Evil <br /> Two of the most wanted individuals in the county <br /> Made Jesse James and Billy the Kid <br /> Look like law-abiding citizens <br /> It's too bad they had to go out the way they did <br /> Got shot in the back coming out of that old saloon <br /> But their spirits still live on 'til this day <br /> Shhh… wait, did y'all hear that? <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />
