         less <br /> And win a slug fest, I get physical like physicians <br /> Invisible like magicians with mystical mic traditions <br /> Wicked wizardry like a sorcerer, no <span class="emotion">remorse</span> for
         you <br /> When I torture you throughout the course of my orchestra <br /> So feel the force of my spiritual images <br /> Slicin' up an enemy's appendages 'til he hemorrhages <br /> My skin itches every time a rapper recites <br /> And when he's through with his verse <br /> I'm all covered in flea bites <br /> You wanna see fights, I got a match for ya <br /> You couldn't flip <span class="profanity">shit</span> playin' in toilets with a
