         <h4>Certification: Diamond</h4> <br /> "Life," by Marshall Mathers <br /> What is life? Life is like a big obstacle <br /> Put in front of your optical to slow you down <br /> And every time you think you've gotten past it <br /> It's gonna come back around <br /> And tackle you to the <span class="profanity">damn</span> ground <br /> What are friends? <br /> Friends are people that you think are your friends <br /> But they're really your enemies, with secret identities <br /> And disguises to hide their true colors <br /> So just when you think you're close enough to be brothers <br /> They wanna come back <br /> And cut your throat when you ain't lookin' <br /> What is money? <br /> Money is what makes a man act funny <br /> Money is the root of all evil <br /> Money'll make them same friends come back around <br /> Swearin' that they was always down <br /> What is life? I'm tired of life <br />  <br />  <br /> I'm tired of backstabbin'-ass snakes with friendly grins <br /> I'm tired of committin' so many sins <br /> Tired of always givin' in when this bottle of Henny wins <br /> Tired of never havin' any ends <br /> Tired of havin' skinny friends, hooked on crack and Mini Thins <br /> I'm tired of this DJ playin' your shit when he spins <br /> Tired of not havin' a deal <br /> Tired of havin' to deal with the bullshit without grabbin' a steel <br /> Tired of drownin' in my sorrow <br /> Tired of havin' to borrow a dollar for gas to start my Monte Carlo <br /> I'm tired of <span class="profanity">motherfuckers</span> sprayin' <span class="profanity">shit</span> and dartin' off <br /> I'm tired of jobs startin' off <br /> At $5.50 an hour, then this boss wonders why I'm smartin' off <br /> I'm tired of bein' fired every time I fart and cough <br /> Tired of havin' to work as a gas station clerk <br /> For this jerk, breathin' down my neck, drivin' me berserk <br /> I'm tired of usin' plastic silverware <br /> Tired of workin' at Builder's Square <br /> Tired of not bein' a millionaire <br />  <br />  <br /> But if I had a million dollars <br /> I'd buy a <span class="profanity">damn</span> brewery and turn the planet into
         alcoholics <br /> If I had a magic wand <br /> I'd make the world suck my dick without a condom on <br /> While I'm on the john <br /> If I had a million bucks, it wouldn't be enough <br /> Because I'd still be out robbin' armored trucks <br /> If I had one wish, I would ask <br /> For a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss <br />  <br />  <br /> I'm tired of bein' white trash, broke and always poor <br /> Tired of takin' pop bottles back to the party store <br /> I'm tired of not havin' a phone <br /> Tired of not havin' a home to have one in if I did have one on <br /> Tired of not drivin' a BM <br /> Tired of not workin' at GM, tired of wantin' to be him <br /> Tired of not sleepin' without a Tylenol PM <br /> Tired of not performin' in a packed coliseum <br /> Tired of not bein' on tour <br /> Tired of <span class="profanity">fuckin'</span> the same blonde <span class="dt">whore</span> <br /> After work, in the back of a Contour <br /> I'm tired of fakin' knots with a stack of ones <br /> Havin' a lack of funds and resortin' back to guns <br /> Tired of bein' stared at <br /> Tired of wearin' the same <span class="profanity">damn</span> Nike Air
         hat <br /> Tired of steppin' in clubs, wearin' the same pair of Lugz <br /> Tired of people sayin' they're tired of hearin' me rap about drugs <br /> Tired of other rappers who ain't bringin' half the skill as me <br /> Sayin' they wasn't feelin' me on "Nobody's As Ill As Me" <br /> And I'm tired of radio stations tellin' fibs <br /> Tired of JLB sayin', "where hip-hop lives" <br />  <br />  <br /> But if I had a million dollars <br /> I'd buy a <span class="profanity">damn</span> brewery and turn the planet into
         alcoholics <br /> If I had a magic wand <br /> I'd make the world suck my dick without a condom on <br /> While I'm on the john <br /> If I had a million bucks, it wouldn't be enough <br /> Because I'd still be out robbin' armored trucks <br /> If I had one wish, I would ask <br /> For a big enough <span class="profanity">ass</span> for the whole world to
         kiss <br />  <br />  <br /> You know what I'm sayin'? <br /> I'm tired of all of this <span class="profanity">bullshit</span>, tellin' me to
         be positive <br /> How am I 'posed to be positive when I don't see <span class="profanity">shit</span> positive? <br /> You know what I'm sayin'? <br /> I rap about <span class="profanity">shit</span> around me, shit I see <br /> You know what I'm sayin'? <br /> And right now, I'm tired of everything <br /> Tired of all this player-hatin' that's goin' on in my own city <br /> Can't get no airplay, you know what I'm sayin'? <br /> But hey, it's cool though, you know what I'm sayin'? <br /> I'm just fed up, that's my word <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />
