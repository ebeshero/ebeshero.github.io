Oh my God! <br /> D: We're gonna have to shock him <br /> N: Oh my God! <br />  <br />  <br /> These are the results of a thousand electric volts <br /> A neck with bolts (Nurse, we're losin' him, check the pulse!) <br /> A kid who refused to respect adults <br /> Wore spectacles with taped frames and a freckled nose <br /> A corny-lookin' white boy, scrawny and always ornery <br /> ‘Cause I was always sick of brawny bullies pickin' on me <br /> And I might snap, one day just like that <br /> I decided to strike back, and flatten every tire on the bike rack <br /> My first day in Junior High, this kid said: "It's you and I <br /> Three o'clock sharp this afternoon you die" <br /> I looked at my watch, it was 1:20 <br /> "I already gave you my lunch money! <br /> What more do you want from me?" <br /> He said: "Don't try to run from me, you'll just make it worse" <br /> My palms were sweaty, and I started to shake at first <br /> Somethin' told me: "Try to fake a stomach ache, it works!" <br /> I screamed: "Oww! My appendix feel like they could burst <br /> Teacher, teacher! Quick, I need a naked nurse" <br /> "What's the matter?" — I don't know, my leg, it hurts <br /> "Leg? I thought you said it was your tummy" <br /> Oh, I mean it is, but I also got a bum knee <br /> "Mr. Mathers, the fun and games are over <br /> And just for that stunt, you're gonna get some extra homework" <br /> But don't you wanna give me after school detention? <br /> "Nah, that bully wants to beat your <span class="profanity">ass</span> and I'ma
         let him" <br />  <br />  <br /> Brain damage, ever since the day I was born <br /> Drugs is what they used to say I was on <br /> They say I never knew which way I was goin' <br /> But everywhere I go they keep playin' my song <br /> Brain damage, ever since the day I was born <br /> Drugs is what they used to say I was on <br /> They say I never knew which way I was goin' <br /> But everywhere I go they keep playin' my song <br />  <br />  <br /> Way before my baby daughter Hailie <br /> I was harassed daily by this fat kid named D'Angelo Bailey <br /> An eighth grader who acted obnoxious, ‘cause his father boxes <br /> So every day he'd shove me in the lockers <br /> One day he came in the bathroom while I was pissin' <br /> And had me in the position to beat me into submission <br /> He banged my head against the urinal 'til he broke my nose <br /> Soaked my clothes in blood, grabbed me and choked my throat <br /> I tried to plead and tell him we shouldn't beef <br /> But he just wouldn't leave <br /> He kept chokin' me and I couldn't breathe <br /> He looked at me and said: "You gonna die, <span class="dt">honky</span>!" <br /> The Principal walked in and started helpin' him stomp me <br /> I made them think they beat me to death <br /> Holdin' my breath for like five minutes before they finally left <br /> Then I got up and ran to the janitor's storage booth <br /> Kicked the door hinge loose <br /> And ripped out the four-inch screws <br /> Grabbed some sharp objects, brooms and foreign tools <br /> This is for every time you took my orange juice <br /> Or stole my seat in the lunchroom and drank my chocolate milk <br /> Every time you tipped my tray and it dropped and spilt <br /> I'm gettin' you back, bully, now once and for good <br /> I cocked the broomstick back and swung hard as I could <br /> And beat him over the head with it 'til I broke the wood <br /> Knocked him down, stood on his chest with one foot <br /> Made it home later that same day <br /> Started readin' a comic, and suddenly everything became gray <br /> I couldn't even see what I was tryin' to read <br /> I went deaf and my left ear started to bleed <br /> My mother started screamin': "What are you on, drugs?! <br /> Look at you! You're gettin' blood all over my rug!" (sorry!) <br /> She beat me over the head with the remote control <br /> Opened a hole and my whole brain fell out of my skull <br /> I picked it up and screamed: "Look, <span class="dt">bitch</span>, what have
         you done?!" <br /> "Oh my God, I'm sorry, son!" — shut up, you <span class="dt">cunt</span>! <br /> I said <span class="profanity">fuck</span> it, took it and stuck it back up in
         my head <br /> Then I sewed it shut and put a couple of screws in my neck <br />  <br />  <br /> Brain damage, ever since the day I was born <br /> Drugs is what they used to say I was on <br /> They say I never knew which way I was goin' <br /> But everywhere I go they keep playin' my song <br /> Brain damage, ever since the day I was born <br /> Drugs is what they used to say I was on <br /> They say I never knew which way I was goin' <br /> But everywhere I go they keep playin' my song <br />  <br />  <br /> Brain damage, it's brain damage <br /> I got brain damage, it's brain damage <br /> It's probably brain damage, it's brain damage <br /> Brain damage, I got brain damage <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />
