            family</span> <br /> Who really didn't care to see, or give a <span class="lifeEvent">damn</span> if
         she <br /> Went out and had a church of kids <br /> As long as when the check came they got first dibs <br /> Now Brenda's belly's gettin' bigger <br /> But no one seems to notice any change in her figure <br /> <span class="lifeEvent">She's twelve years old and she's havin' a
            baby</span> <br /> In love with a molester, who's sexin' her crazy <br /> And yet and she thinks that he'll be with her forever <br /> And dreams of a world where the two of them are together Whatever, <br /> <span class="lifeEvent">he left her and she had the baby solo</span> <br /> <span class="lifeEvent"> She had it on the bathroom floor and didn't know,
            so</span> <br /> She didn't know what to throw away and what to keep <br /> She wrapped the baby up and threw him in a trash heap <br /> I guess she thought she'd get away, wouldn't hear the cries <br /> She didn't realize how much the little baby had her eyes <br /> Now the baby's in the trash heap, bawlin' <br /> Momma can't help her, but it hurt to hear her callin' <br /> Brenda wants to run away <br /> Momma say you makin' me lose pay <br /> There's social workers here every day <br /> Now Brenda's gotta make her own way <br /> Can't go to her family, they won't let her stay <br /> No money, no babysitter, she couldn't keep a job <br /> <span class="lifeEvent">She tried to sell crack but end up gettin'
            robbed</span> <br /> So now, what's next? There ain't nothin' left to sell <br /> So she sees sex as a way of leavin' hell <br /> It's payin' the rent, so she really can't complain <br /> Prostitute, found slain, and Brenda's her name She's got a baby <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />
