            shitty</span> <br /> If he's actin' soft and he cowers, he better come cleaner <br /> Than Jeru jackin' off when he showers <br /> You flowers got no clout with a thing <br /> You could date a stick of dynamite <br /> And wouldn't go out with a bang <br /> I shout with a slang, simple as ABC's <br /> Skip over the D's and rock the microphone with ease <br /> Dethrone MC's, and I'ma max alone <br /> Relax your dome, like a solo from a saxophone <br /> So facts are known, biters get treated with shots <br /> I rock a beat harder than you could beat it with rocks <br /> I'm greeted with flocks of fellow followers' singers <br /> You couldn't make the fans throw up their hands <br /> If they swallowed their fingers <br /> But you can bring yours, let's see what you got <br /> But don't front, and never try to be what you're not <br /> 'Cause you can be quick <br /> Jump the candlestick, burn your back <br /> And <span class="profanity">fuck</span> Jill on a hill, but you still ain't
