         (really) <br /> Only God can judge me now <br />  <br />  <br /> Singer: 2Pac <br />  <br /> Perhaps I was blind to the facts, stabbed in the back <br /> I couldn't trust my own homies, just a bunch of dirty rats <br /> Will I succeed? Paranoid from the weed <br /> And hocus pocus, I try to focus, but I can't see <br /> And in my mind I'm a blind man doin' time <br /> Look to my future, ‘cause my past is all behind me <br /> Is it a crime to fight for what is mine? <br /> Everybody's dyin', tell me what's the use of tryin' <br /> I've been trapped since birth, cautious ‘cause I'm cursed <br /> And fantasies of my family in a hearse <br /> And they say it's the White man I should fear <br /> But it's my own kind doin' all the killin' here <br /> I can't lie, ain't no love for the other side <br /> <span class="emotion">Jealousy</span> inside, make 'em wish I died <br /> Oh my Lord, tell me what I'm livin' for <br /> Everybody's droppin', got me knockin' on Heaven's door <br /> <span class="lifeEvent">And all my memories of seein' brothers
            bleed</span> <br /> And everybody grieves, but still nobody sees <br /> Recollect your thoughts, don't get caught up in the mix <br /> ‘Cause the media is full of dirty tricks <br />  <br />  <br /> Singer: 2Pac <br />  <br /> Only God can judge me <br /> Only God can judge me, only God <br /> Only God can judge me <br /> Only God can judge me <br /> Only God can judge me, only God <br /> Only God can judge me now <br /> Only God can judge me, only God <br /> Only God can judge me <br /> Only God can judge me, only God <br /> Only God can judge me <br />  <br />  <br /> Flatline <br />  <br />  <br /> Singer: 2Pac <br />  <br /> I hear the doctor standin' over me, screamin' I can make it <br /> Got a body full of bullet holes, layin' here naked <br /> Still I can't breathe, something's evil in my IV <br /> ‘Cause everytime I breathe I think they killin' me <br /> I'm havin' nightmares, homicidal fantasies <br /> I wake up stranglin', dangled in my bed sheets <br /> I call the nurse ‘cause it hurts to reminisce <br /> How did it come to this? I wish they didn't miss <br /> Somebody help me, tell me where to go from here <br /> ‘Cause even thugs cry, but do the Lord care? <br /> Try to remember but it hurts <br /> I'm walkin' through the cemetery, talkin' to the dirt <br /> I'd rather die like a man than live like a coward <br /> There's a ghetto up in Heaven and it's ours <br /> "Black Power!" is what we scream <br /> As we dream in a paranoid state <br /> And our fate is a lifetime of hate <br /> Dear Mama, can you save me? And <span class="profanity">fuck</span>
         peace <br /> ‘Cause the streets got our babies, we gotta eat <br /> No more hesitation, each and every black male's trapped <br /> And they wonder why we suicidal running 'round strapped <br /> Mr. Police, please try to see <br /> That there's a million <span class="profanity">motherfuckers</span> stressin'
         just like me <br />  <br />  <br /> Singer: 2Pac <br />  <br /> Only God can judge me <br /> Only God can judge me, only God <br /> Only God can judge me <br /> Only God can judge me <br /> Only God can judge me, only God <br /> Only God can judge me now <br /> Only God can judge me, only God <br /> Only God can judge me <br /> Only God can judge me, only God <br /> Only God can judge me <br />  <br />  <br /> Singer: 2Pac <br />  <br /> That which does not kill me can only make me stronger <br /> That's for real <br /> And I don't see why everybody feel as though <br /> That they gotta tell me how to live my life <br /> You know? <br /> Let me live, baby, let me live <br />  <br />  <br /> Featured Singer: Rappin' 4-Tay <br />  <br /> Pac, I feel ya, keep servin' it on the reala <br /> For instance, say a playa-hatin' mark is out to kill ya <br /> Would you be wrong for buckin' a <span class="profanity">nigga</span> to the
         pavement? <br /> He gon' get me first, if I don't get him fool start prayin' <br /> Ain't no such thing as self-defense in the court of law <br /> So judge us when we get to where we're goin wearin' a cross <br /> That's real, got him, lurked him, crept the <span class="profanity">fuck</span>
