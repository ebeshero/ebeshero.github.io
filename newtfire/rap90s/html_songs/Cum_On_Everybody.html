         <h4>Certification: Diamond</h4> <br /> Yeah, haha, whoo, <span class="profanity">shit</span> <br /> Yo, mic check, testing <br /> One, two, um… twelve <br /> Whattup whattup whattup! (Outsidaz) <br /> This is my dance song, can you hear me? <br /> (Rah Digga, Pacewon, Young Zee) <br /> Alright, aye, turn my headphones up <br />  <br />  <br /> My favorite color is red, like the blood shed <br /> From Kurt Cobain's head when he shot himself dead <br /> Women all grabbin' at my shish-kabob <br /> Bought Lauryn Hill's tape so her kids could starve <br /> (“I can’t stand white people”) <br /> You thought I was ill and now I'm even more so <br /> <span class="profanity">Shit</span>, I got full-blown AIDS and a sore
         throat <br /> I got a wardrobe with an orange robe <br /> I'm in the fourth row, signin' autographs at your show <br /> I just remembered that I'm absent-minded <br /> Wait, I mean I've lost my mind, I can't find it <br /> I'm freestylin' every verse that I spit <br /> ‘Cause I don't even remember the words to my <span class="profanity">shit</span> <br /> I told the doc I need a change in sickness <br /> And gave a girl herpes in exchange for syphilis <br /> Put my LP on your Christmas gift list <br /> You want to get high? Here, <span class="dt">bitch</span>, just sniff
         this! <br />  <br />  <br /> Cum on everybody <br /> (Get down tonight) <br />  <br />  <br /> <span class="lifeEvent">I tried suicide once and I'll try it
            again</span> <br /> That's why I write songs where I die at the end <br /> ‘Cause I don't give a <span class="profanity">fuck</span>, like my middle
         finger was stuck <br /> And I was wavin' it at everybody, screaming, "I suck!" <br /> I go on stage in front of a sell-out crowd <br /> And yell out loud: "All y'all get the <span class="profanity">hell</span> out
         now!" <br /> <span class="profanity">Fuck</span> rap, I'm givin' it up, y'all, I'm
         sorry <br /> (But Eminem, this is your record release party!) <br /> I'm bored out of my gourd, so I took a hammer and nailed my foot to the floorboard
         of my Ford <br /> Guess I'm just a sick sick <span class="dt">bastard</span> <br /> Who's one sandwich short of a picnic basket <br /> One Excedrin tablet short of a full medicine cabinet <br /> I feel like my head has been shredded <br /> Like lettuce and cabbage <br /> And if you ever see a video for this <span class="profanity">shit</span> <br /> I'll probably be dressed up like a mummy with my wrists slit <br />  <br />  <br /> Cum on everybody <br /> (Get down tonight) <br />  <br />  <br /> Got <span class="profanity">bitches</span> on my jock out in East
         Detroit <br /> ‘Cause they think that I'm a <span class="profanity">motherfuckin'</span>
         Beastie Boy <br /> So I told 'em I was Mike D <br /> They was like, "Gee, I don't know, he might be!" <br /> I told 'em, "Meet me at Kid Rock's next concert <br /> I'll be standin' by the Loch Ness Monster." <br /> Peace out, then I jetted to the weed house, smoked out <br /> 'Til I started bustin' freestyles, broke out <br /> Then I dipped quick back to the crib, put on lipstick <br /> Crushed up the Tylenol and ate it with a dipstick <br /> Made a couple of crank calls collect (*brrrrrrring, click*) <br /> "It's Ken Kaniff from Connecticut, can you accept?" <br /> I want to make songs all the fellas dub <br /> And murder every rich rapper that I'm <span class="emotion">jealous</span>
         of <br /> So just remember when I bomb your set <br /> Yo, I only cuss to make your mom <span class="emotion">upset</span> <br />  <br />  <br /> Cum on everybody <br /> (Get down tonight) <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />
