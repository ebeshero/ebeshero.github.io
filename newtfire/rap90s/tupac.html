            <h2>About Tupac:</h2>
            <p> Tupac Shakur was a rapper who was the face of the 1990s gansta-rap era. He is one of
                the top-selling artists of all time and has sold over 75 million albums. Tupac used
                rapping as a medium to communicate the injustices for the African-American
                population. (More on the album)</p>
            <p> Tupac was born to Alice Faye Williams, a member of the Black Panther Party, on June
                16, 1971. Similarly to Eminem, he spent most of his childhood moving around to
                different locations. The family then settled in Baltimore and he ended up attending
                the elite Baltimore School of the Arts. He excelled as a student, receiving
                distinguished honors. However, before he could graduate, his family had to relocate
                once again to Marin City, California. There he started to sell drugs and got
                involved with the gang culture. This new lifestyle contributed to some of his rap
                lyrics later on. He then joined Digital Underground in 1990. He performed two albums
                called This is an EP Release and Sons of the P. before coming out with 2Pacalypse
                Now (a selected album for the project).</p>
            <p> 2Pacalypse Now was a divergence from the typical dance party music of Digital
                Underground and was more similar to Public Enemy and West Cost gangsta rappers. Even
                the album was limited to radio appeal and criticism made by Vice President Dan
                Quayle on the song “Soulja’s Story” during the 1992 presidential campaign, it still
                sold very well. Tupac then was ranked amongst the other famous rappers like Ice Cube
                and Ice-T. As Tupac became more successful, his gangsta lifestyle was magnified even
                more. He was convicted of sexual assault on a number accounts in 1994 and then
                served eight months in prison. He signed with Death Row Records for his next album
                release, which ended up being All Eyez on Me (other album being analyzed). This
                two-disc album refers to his embodiment of his gangsta lifestyle. The album sold
                more than five million copies in the first year and debuted at number one on the
                Billboard charts.</p>
            <p> Unfortunately, Tupac was shot various times by an unknown person when he was leaving
                a Las Vegas casino on September 7, 1996. It is believed that this occurred due to
                the strong, ongoing feud between the East Coast and West Coast rap scenes. He died a
                week later. Although he had a short career, his legacy still carries on to this day
                and he is an icon for the rap community. Even into the 21st century, more 2Pac
                albums have been released, which are mostly repackaged or remixed existing
                songs.</p>
