               <i> (Opening shot: the full moon in the quiet night sky. A distant flash is seen, and after a moment this resolves into a red-and-yellow alien
                  spacecraft that zooms toward the camera and off to one side. Cutting a path straight
                  through the clouds, it cruises over Jump City Bay and heads straight for the urban center. As it passes the bridge and Titans Tower, the wake of its passage throws up a wall of water.) </i>
               
               <i> (Cut to an alley, where several dogs are nosing through the trash in search of something to eat. They
                  cut off their search and bark angrily at the passing vessel, which now sets course
                  for the mountains outside the city. A quick dive behind a ridge puts it out of view; the subsequent
                  crash and cloud of smoke mark a very hard landing in deed. Cut to a close-up of the
                  fresh furrow cut in the dirt by the skidding craft and tilt up to point along its
                  length toward the final point of rest, then zoom in and dissolve to a closer view.
                  Within the haze, a red-eyed silhouette rears up and leaps clear to land near us. It
                  is a green dog, tongue hanging out, and it gives the camera an enthusiastic lick.
                  Fade to black as drool covers the lens.) </i>

               <i> (Opening shot: the exterior of Titans Tower, zooming in slowly. It is now the following day. Inside, <span class="char">Cyborg</span> is tuning up the engine of the T-Car, with the help of the acetylene torch built
                  into his finger. Pull back and pan across the garage; <span class="char">Beast Boy</span>, as a lizard, scuttles up the side of a storage container and reaches the ceiling.
                  Hanging there, upside down, he surveys the budding mechanic hard at work. Close-up
                  of <span class="char">Cyborg</span>, who gets an unexpected visit in the form of <span class="char">Beast Boy</span> landing on his arm. The former's eyes bug out.) </i>

                  parts <span class="char">Cyborg</span> was using scatter everywhere. Both get up, <span class="char">Beast Boy</span> returning to human form, and <span class="char">Cyborg</span>'s face goes bright red as he growls in rage.) </i>

Working on your car? Bet you could use a few extra hands.</p>
               
               <i> (He becomes a squid.) </i>

               <i> (<span class="char">Cyborg</span> looks over at him and drops all the equipment again with a panicked little stutter.
                  Close-up of <span class="char">Beast Boy</span>; the item comes to life and emits a beam of energy. A scream from the o.c. <span class="char">Cyborg</span> drifts back in time with a dense cloud of smoke. When it clears, we see that a good
                  portion of the T-Car's bodywork has been badly singed. <span class="char">Cyborg</span> snorts furiously at his green comrade.) </i>

               <i> (<span class="char">Beast Boy</span> takes the hint and runs out of the place. Dissolve to the exterior of the Tower, seen from ground level, and tilt down to the rock outcroppings that line the island's shores. On one is a control panel, while on a lower level a couple of man-shaped cutout targets
                  pop up-operated remotely from the panel. <span class="char">Robin</span> sails into view and strikes one, then the other, destroying both; he then goes into
                  a fast run and breaks three more with various kung fu moves. As he hurls himself at
                  another one, <span class="char">Beast Boy</span> pops up right in front of it.) </i>

               <i> (His face goes slack as he realizes what is about to happen; an instant later, he takes
                  the full force of the hit and is sent tumbling high and far. Woozily, he peels himself
                  halfway up.) </i>

               <i> (His face falls. Zoom in as he looks away, frustrated and dejected, then cut to inside the Tower's open main entrance and tilt down to floor level. <span class="char">Beast Boy</span> backs into view.) </i>

                  him; the camera pointing across the street from the pizza joint seen in "Final Exam." Two girls are at a sidewalk table. Stars appear in his eyes as he grins hopefully.) </i>

                  in the center of their pizza by mistake. The hand slides away through the cheese and
                  sauce; he loses his balance and comes down hard to bang his chin on the table edge.) </i>

                  down on his head. Laughing, the two girls get up and leave; cut to a close-up of him.
                  He stands up and pulls the pitcher loose after a moment's effort, then cocks an ear
                  at the sound of assorted cooing words from the o.c. pair. Cut to a long shot of them, now in the park across the street, and zoom in. They are talking to and petting a large brown dog whose young male owners stand nearby.) </i>

               <i> (Acting quickly on the brainstorm, he turns himself into a green dog with large dark
                  spots and runs barking toward the park. He stops on the grass, wagging and panting
                  as endearingly as he knows how-only to get puzzled stares from both girls and the

                  an alley, where the green dog seen in the prologue barks and pokes its head up from a Dumpster.
                  It leaps out and begins to gnaw at a boot left on the pavement; but after a few chews,
                  the sound of something approaching makes it drop the item and yip worriedly. In the
                  sky above, the spacecraft is moving over the alley. It hovers above the dog, and a broad beam of light pours from a hatch on the underisde.
                  The boot is sucked up into this-a tractor beam-and the canine takes off running to

               <i> (They run for the door. Dissolve to a slow pan across an unoccupied section of the park. Stop after a short distance as <span class="char">Beast Boy</span> comes up over a hill. He stops and whines softly at his twofold rejection-first as
                  a teenager, then as a dog-but a distant bit of yapping shakes him out of it. Cut to
                  over his shoulder and zoom in a bit; the real pooch skids out from behind a bush and
                  runs straight at him. A head-on collision sends both to the ground and stuns them
