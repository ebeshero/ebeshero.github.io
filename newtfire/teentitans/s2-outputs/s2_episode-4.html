                  pummeled by<span class="char">Robin</span> in the gym. Alternate twice between closer zooms on the Tower's top floor and the spiky-haired Titan attacking the bag. On the last of these gym
                  shots,<span class="char">Starfire</span> flies past, followed by a barrage of lasers and the shooters; several small flying
                  spheres. Flipping onto her back, she throws a handful of starbolts and turns one after
                  another into scrap metal. She stops in midair to look back at one explosion, only
                  to find three more spheres coming at her from that direction; she bails out.) </i>

                  wipe out very badly. From here, cut to a digital readout panel on the wall. It shows
                  a set of bar graphs, a human outline, and the number 002 next to the letters "BST
                  BOY." Pan/tilt down to a nearby treadmill, on which <span class="char">Beast Boy</span> is running as a turtle: the number is his speed in miles per hour. Back to the display,
                  the digits ticking up from 005 to 006; he turns into a bighorn sheep and starts to
                  move faster. Now the readout quickly increases from 032 to 038, and he transforms

                  loaded onto an enormous sled, and the camera tilts down to show<span class="char">Cyborg</span> straining to hold the immense burden aloft. His forearm panel shows a reading of

                  and overall. It ticks up to 95% as he groans under the load, sweat pouring down his
