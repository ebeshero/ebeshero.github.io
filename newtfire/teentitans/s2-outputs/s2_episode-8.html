               <i> (Opening shot: a long view of Titans Tower, with the sun setting behind it. Zoom in slowly, then cut to <span class="char">Robin</span> in mid-leap, a fierce growl in his throat and one fist pulled back past his head.
                  He swings it forward and nails a flying volleyball; pull back to follow it over a
                  net toward <span class="char">Cyborg</span> and <span class="char">Starfire</span>, on the other side. A metal-handed bump sends the ball up, and the camera pulls back
                  again to frame the entire court: it is on the Tower's roof, and <span class="char">Beast Boy</span> is <span class="char">Robin</span>'s teammate. <span class="char">Raven</span> is nowhere to be seen for the moment.) </i>
               
               <i> (After a few more volleys, pull back to the edge of the roof. The fifth Titan floats into view, meditating a foot or so above the surface.) </i>
               
               
               <p><span class="raven">Raven: </span> <i> (chanting) </i> Azarath Metrion Zinthos... Azarath Metrion Zinthos..<i> (Cut to behind her; she faces the sun.) </i> Azarath Metrion Zinthos...</p>
               
               <i> (Back to the court. The ball sails across, but <span class="char">Beast Boy</span> hops up as a kangaroo and kicks it back hard. <span class="char">Starfire</span> flies up to deliver a killer spike, <span class="char">Robin</span> jumps for a counter-move, she slides across to bump, and now <span class="char">Cyborg</span> rushes in for the follow-up. As the ball descends toward the net, the big man gets
                  ready to spike and suddenly finds himself facing an even bigger green gorilla with
                  the same idea in mind. <span class="char">Beast Boy</span> smashes the ball past both members of the opposition; it hurtles straight toward
                  the back of <span class="char">Raven</span>'s head. An instant after he comes down from his jump, he resumes human form and panics.) </i>
               
               
               <p><span class="beastBoy">Beast Boy: </span> <span class="char">Raven</span>, heads up!</p>
               
               <i> (The ball continues its flight, but stops dead an inch short of her cranium thanks
                  to an annoyed glance and a bit of telekinesis. Rocketing back toward the four players
                  as she faces forward to resume meditation, it slams into <span class="char">Beast Boy</span>'s breadbasket.) </i>
               
               
               <p><span class="beastBoy">Beast Boy: </span> Yow!...Thanks, uh..<i> (collapses) </i> ...good save</p>
               
               <i> (<span class="char">Robin</span> looks worriedly at him, then the camera.) </i>

               <i> (Close-up of her face. On the start of the next line, pan slightly to one side, putting
                  the rest of the Titans in view at a distance.) </i>

               <p><span class="raven">Raven: </span> <i> (from o.c.) </i> I can't. I have to meditate.</p>
               
               <i> (Shrugs all around, after which <span class="char">Cyborg</span> puts his arm back on and they resume the game. Close-up of the ball in <span class="char">Beast Boy</span>'s hand; he transforms while raising it to serve, and the camera pulls back to show
                  that he has again become a gorilla. After pounding it ahead, he hits the court and
                  returns to human form, blowing his cool a second time.) </i>
               
               
               <p><span class="beastBoy">Beast Boy: </span> Heads up, again!</p>
               
               <i> (The ball zooms toward <span class="char">Raven</span> as before; this time, though, she does not stop it, but instead floats off to one
                  side and lets it continue toward the edge.) </i>
               
               
               <p><b>Robin, Beast Boy, Cyborg and Starfire: </b> OH, NO!!</p>
               
               <i> (All scream. The ball goes into space; cut to a view of the Tower from a couple of stories up, the camera pointing toward the roof, and tilt down to
                  follow the tumbling sphere. It bounces among the rocks and toward the shore. Back
                  to the four players, whose panic gives way to resignation.) </i>
               
               
               <p><span class="beastBoy">Beast Boy: </span> <i> (as the others groan) </i> I'll get it.</p>
               
               <i> (He trudges toward the edge, but is brought up short by the reappearance of the ball,
                  which sails back up from below to roll across the concrete and stop at his feet. Close-up
                  of him, looking up puzzled as something begins to rumble o.c., then cut to the edge.
                  A slender silhouette rises into view, long hair blowing in the breeze, hands planted
                  on hips, standing on a floating object. The voice instantly gives away this person's
                  identity and part in returning the ball.) </i>
               
               
               <p><b>Terra: </b> So...</p>
               
               <i> (Her perch can only be a levitated rock, then. That one word is enough to demonstrate
                  that something has fundamentally changed in her nature; not a lick of panic or fear
                  or trepidation, all of which surfaced during her brief visit in "Terra." Close-up
                  of her face, set in a confident half-smile; instead of the crop top she wore in that
                  episode, she now sports a turtleneck collar.) </i>

               <i> (Opening shot: an overhead view of the Tower's roof, zooming in, then cut to the surface. <span class="char">Terra</span>'s rock floats down to it and she leaps off; seen from the waist down in this shot,
                  she has traded her denim shorts for yellow-orange ones, but still wears her old brown
                  hiking boots.) </i>

                  Titan insignia on the chest, and no second shirt underneath. Same leather gloves,
                  a matching belt, and a new pair of goggles around her neck. She tosses her hair back.) </i>

                  did when they first met. This time, however, each squeeze makes <span class="char">Terra</span>'s head bulge more and more, as of air being forced into one end of a balloon.) </i>
