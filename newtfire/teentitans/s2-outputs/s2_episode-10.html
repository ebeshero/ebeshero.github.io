                  to the floor, and several of<span class="char">Slade</span>'s commando robots, one carrying a large canister, walk past him. Overhead view: many other guards lie knocked out as well. Outside, a section of the
                  wall is blown out and the screen fills with dust, which clears to show the robots
                  making their exit.<span class="char">Robin</span>'s birdarang flashes across the screen and smashes away part of the leader's head;
                  cut to a close-up of it in flight and follow it back to the thrower's hand. Pull back
                  to show the original five Titans on the scene.) </i>

               <i> (We see that she has forgone the goggles she used in "Terra" and "Titan Rising." She
                  sends all the spare rocks across the open area and neatly crushes several robots.) </i>

               <i> (All six move in,<span class="char">Terra</span> bringing a few more rocks along. She changes positions and lowers the one she was
                  standing on so that<span class="char">Robin</span> can hop aboard. Laser blasts from the surviving robots slash the air, but he swerves
                  expertly around them. Finally, he leaps off; the stone crashes into one shooter, and
                  he delivers a flying kick to another. More shots emerge from farther back, zeroing
                  in on the approaching<span class="char">Starfire</span>. She returns fire with her eye beams, tracing a blazing path through three other
                  robots; it explodes after a moment and throws them in all directions.) </i>

                  as<span class="char">Raven</span> lets go. Down it comes like a few dozen loads of bricks to crush a knot of robots
                  to pancakes.) </i>

               <i> (She creates a shield in front of herself; a laser shot immediately blasts it apart
                  and throws her backward. The robot that fired it flies up behind her, using its boot-mounted
                  rockets to stay aloft, and cuts loose with another blast that shatters<span class="char">Terra</span>'s stone platform. She tumbles to the ground and very soon finds herself staring up
                  at a couple of the burglars, but <span class="char">Beast Boy</span>, as a large gorilla, jumps down behind her and roars, pounding his chest in fury.
                  Cut to one robot, which gets a huge green smack across the face, then pan to the other
                  just in time for it to receive the same. A third runs toward<span class="char">Beast Boy</span> and is swatted away; a fourth jumps on his back, but he picks it off, slams it to
                  the ground, and throws it against a charging fifth. Finally, he roars, scoops<span class="char">Terra</span> up, and returns to human form.) </i>
               
               
               <p><b>Terra: </b> You saved me.</p>
               
               
               <p><span class="beastBoy">Beast Boy: </span> <i> (blushing, hearts in eyes) </i> Yeah. That was cool.</p>
               
               
               <p><b>Terra: </b> Uh,<span class="char">Beast Boy</span>? You can put me down now. <i> (He comes to his senses with a little yelp and does so, then backs up.) </i></p>

               <i> (A robot being thrown past them cuts him off; he gives her a big sheepish grin and
                  runs in the direction it came from. Brief close-up of<span class="char">Terra</span>'s suddenly worried face, then cut to another part of the plain, where<span class="char">Robin</span> and a commando charge at each other. His fighting staff out and at full length, he
                  nails the enemy with a backward flip kick to the chin and swings the weapon to knock
                  away another one when it rushes in. A roar and jump carry him in range to bash a third
                  upside the head, the camera panning to follow. As he lands the blow, there is a brief
                  flicker and click as of a camera shutter snapping. After this, we see him in freeze
                  frame; his name appears on the screen along with a few computer graph readouts.) </i>
               
               <i> (Cut to<span class="char">Raven</span>, rising higher in the air with a black aura surrounding her body. She forms this
                  into a group of energy streams and hurls them downward; freeze frame just like<span class="char">Robin</span>'s. From here, cut to <span class="char">Cyborg</span> running at a commando. He drills it with a killer uppercut, then brings out his sonic
                  cannon and fires in a different direction, and he too is seen in freeze frame. Cut
                  to a group of robots, fleeing from a hail of starbolts, and as smoke pours up from
                  the points of impact,<span class="char">Starfire</span> flies out of it and hurls another one. Freeze frame. Cut to<span class="char">Beast Boy</span> and pan to follow him as he becomes a bighorn sheep and rams another of the thieves.
                  Freeze frame.) </i>
               
               <i> (Smoke billows up to cover the entire screen. It clears to show a silhouetted figure
                  watching a wall of small monitors; each of the preceding five shots appears several
                  times on them. This person's back is to us, but the voice is a dead giveaway.) </i>

               <i> (Close-up of a desk, panning across the surface. It is littered with notes, books,
                  maps, and Titan equipment; some of<span class="char">Robin</span>'s discs, dismantled communicator, grappling hook, fighting staff.) </i>
               
               
               <p><b>Slade: </b> <i> (from o.c.) </i> You've done well. Very well. All your hard work is about to pay off. <i> (Cut to behind him.) </i> Tonight we strike.</p>
               
               <i> (Pull back a bit to partially frame a second shadowy figure at a distance.) </i>
               
               
               <p><b>Slade: </b> And by sunrise tomorrow... <i> (Extreme close-up of a large blue eye; he continues o.c.) </i> ...the Titans will be annihilated.</p>

                  view and sits down at the keyboard. Zoom in slightly as she looks warily over each
                  shoulder to make sure she is alone. She then lets out a huge breath and starts typing;
