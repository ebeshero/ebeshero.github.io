               <i> (Opening shot: a dark pane of glass, which shakes a bit as several pairs of glowing
                  eyes open behind it. Pull back slightly and pan across the area as a voice begins to speak male, but distorted
                  somewhat. The camera movement reveals a dimly lit room and ranks of glass holding pens stuffed with black silhouettes; the whirring sound
                  of many beating wings is heard.) </i>
               
               
               <p><b>Male Voice: </b> Patience, my children. Soon, you shall wreak the havoc you crave.</p>
               
               <i> (On the end of this line, the speaker comes into view. Standing at a worktable with
                  his back to the camera, he is humanoid, covered with black and white fuzz; two pairs of striated insect wings
                  sprout from his back. This is <span class="char">Killer Moth</span>, working under the illumination provided by an overhead skylight. He is in the basement of a house.) </i>
               
               
               <p><b>Killer Moth: </b> Soon, I shall have the power I deserve. Soon, the entire city will bow before its
                  new master..<i> (turns to face the camera) </i> ...Killer Moth!</p>
               
               <i> (His head is that of the aforementioned insect, and the fuzz stops short of his abdomen
                  and legs; these are covered with tough gray hide. He laughs madly, but a second voice
                  cuts him off in a heartbeat. This one is young, female, and very petulant. Those of
                  you who watch The Powerpuff Girls regularly, imagine Princess Morebucks at sixteen
                  or so and you have the idea.) </i>
               
               
               <p><b>Female voice: </b> DADDY!! DAAAADDDDDYYYYY!!</p>

                  an extreme close-up of the screaming mouth, them pull back to frame her. She is a teenager, blond, wearing pink pajamas and sitting on a bed. The room is done out in the same color, marking it as hers. This is <span class="char">Kitten</span>.) </i>
               
               <i> (Cut to inside the closed door. <span class="char">Killer Moth</span> smashes it open and runs in.) </i>
               
               
               <p><b>Killer Moth: </b> Daddy's working, <span class="char">Kitten</span>. Can't this wait until--?</p>
               
               
               <p><b>Kitten: </b> <i> (storming back and forth) </i> No! He broke up with me. My stupid ex-boyfriend <span class="char">Fang</span> broke up with me! And now, I don't have a date for the prom!</p>
               
               <i> (As she crosses before him, we see that she wears a pink band in her hair to hold it
                  back. A telephone is flung across the room, then a pillow, and then she pulls at her
                  hair and throws herself facedown on the bed with a groan that turns into a sobbing
                  jag. Her father sits down next to her and holds his hand uncertainly out toward her
                  back, not having much of an idea what to do in this crisis. Finally, he strokes her
                  hair. Through the bedroom window, the sky is seen to be darkening into the purple
                  of early evening.) </i>
               
               
               <p><b>Killer Moth: </b> Uh...there, there. I'm sure you'll find another date</p>
               
               <i> (She sits up.) </i>
               
               
               <p><b>Kitten: </b> <i> (groans disgustedly) </i> Prom is tomorrow, Daddy. I don't have time to find another date. So you're gonna
                  find one for me!</p>
               
               <i> (Sight gag: on the end of this, her head inflates to jumbo size and his figure shrinks
                  ten or twelve notches as she leans over him. He stands up; the gag ends.) </i>
               
               
               <p><b>Killer Moth: </b> Now, <span class="char">Kitten</span>, be reasonable! You don't seriously expect me to--</p>
               
               
               <p><b>Kitten: </b> <i> (sits up to face him) </i> And I don't want just anyone. I want someone handsome, and popular, and totally cool.
                  Someone no other girl could get<i> (Extreme close-up of her mouth.) </i> Someone who'll drive <span class="char">Fang</span> wild with jealousy! I want--</p>
               
               <i> (Cut to <span class="char">Robin</span> in mid-leap. He lands neatly in the driver's seat of a red motorcycle whose windshield
                  hugs the front fender as it sweeps back toward him. A large R is stenciled onto a
                  circular protrusion near the footrest. This is the R-Cycle, <span class="char">Robin</span>'s personal mode of transport. Close-up of a red crash helmet held aloft and marked
                  with an R; pull back as he brings it down onto his head. He revs the engine, brings
                  the chopper around in a tearing skid, and speeds toward the camera. Snap to black
                  just as he is about to collide with it.) </i>
               
               
               OPENING THEM

               <i> (Opening shot: <span class="char">Robin</span> bent over the handlebars, his cape blowing nearly straight out behind him due to the high velocity.) </i>
               
               
               <p><span class="robin">Robin: </span> Range to target!</p>
               
               <i> (In another street, the T-Car is rolling up fast. Close-up of<span class="char">Raven</span> in the front passenger seat; pan to <span class="char">Cyborg</span> at the wheel on the next line.) </i>
               
               
               <p><span class="cyborg">Cyborg: </span> Five hundred and closing. Should have a visual any--</p>
               
               <i> (Cut to <span class="char">Starfire</span> in flight. <span class="char">Beast Boy</span>, as a vulture, keeps pace with her.) </i>

               <i> (Close-up of a hand reaching into a jewelry store window to scoop out the contents. As <span class="char">Cyborg</span>'s tires are heard screeching in the distance and his headlights play over the area,
                  the camera pulls back to frame the thief who has a teen male's body and a gargantuan spider's head. A complete carapace,
                  with four legs, is attached to the latter; its legs are long enough to reach the ground. Across the street, the R-Cycle has pulled up and <span class="char">Robin</span> glares at this creature, and <span class="char">Cyborg</span> brings his vehicle in a moment later.) </i>
               
               <i> (The thief raises a weapon and lifts his human body clear of the ground as the camera
                  pulls back from him. <span class="char">Robin</span> gasps in surprise, and he and <span class="char">Cyborg</span> peel out in opposite directions to avoid the blast, which rips across the pavement.
                  Both drivers skid to a stop; the cross-breed howls in anger and leaps straight toward
                  the sky. Tilt up to follow him to roof level, where he touches down and starts to
                  bound away. <span class="char">Robin</span> watches him jump across the street with ease.) </i>
               
               <i> (Now those long legs carry the store-breaker down the facades, and the Titans set off
                  after him on wheels and in the air. <span class="char">Starfire</span> sends a few starbolts toward him, but he easily dodges and continues his sideways
                  run; a huge leap carries him to the buildings on the other side of the street. Here
                  comes <span class="char">Robin</span>, gunning his engine and extending a blaster by each handlebar. He pops off a string
                  of shots that barely miss the semi-arachnid, who crosses the street again and keeps
                  right on going.) </i>
               
               <i> (The T-Car pulls ahead of the R-Cycle and opens its sunroof. Instead of the proton
                  cannon used in Car Trouble, though, a missile pops out and is launched. It streaks
                  through the evening sky and zeroes in on the thief, who jumps clear to avoid the impact
                  and explosion. Close-up of him in midair; he does a 180-degree turn and spits a large
                  wad of gray slime as the camera pulls back to frame <span class="char">Beast Boy</span> and <span class="char">Starfire</span> in hot pursuit. He takes the brunt of it and is engulfed in the goo, which splatters
                  itself all over a wall at ground level. Back in human form, he pokes his head, one
                  arm, and both legs out and struggles to get free of the viscous material super-strength
                  spider silk that has not yet dried.) </i>

               <i> (The shooter spews out another mouthful, forcing <span class="char">Starfire</span> to get out of the way. Dodging one gobbet after another, she keeps the pressure on.
                  Overhead view of the street; from o.c., he spits a stream of adhesive back and forth,
                  layering it to create a thick sheet that stretches to block the entire way. Tilt up
                  to frame <span class="char">Robin</span> and <span class="char">Cyborg</span> bearing down on this. <span class="char">Robin</span> gasps, while <span class="char">Raven</span> puts her powers to work and extends them over the entire block. Pavement cracks and
                  a fire hydrant opens up, gushing water along the sidewalk; both vehicles sail up the
                  incline created by the shifting roadbed and pass neatly over the barrier.) </i>
               
               <i> (The smash-and-grab artist scuttles flat out, his human body waving in the wind, and
                  turns to spit more silk. <span class="char">Robin</span> swerves expertly to avoid <span class="char">Beast Boy</span>'s fate, but a load hits the T-Car's windshield and completely blankets it.) </i>
               
               
               <p><span class="cyborg">Cyborg: </span> I can't see!</p>
               
               <i> (He cuts his steering wheel hard to one side and skids to a stop as the R-Cycle roars
                  past. More sludge comes down on the windshield. Now <span class="char">Starfire</span> starts to catch up again, but a well-placed burst sends her to the sidewalk and pins
                  her. She tries vainly to free herself as <span class="char">Robin</span> zooms by, then cuts through it with a handful of starbolts and returns to the chase.
                  The thief races down the street and around a corner; <span class="char">Robin</span> and <span class="char">Starfire</span> follow it, and the camera cuts to the end of a street that faces an elevated highway.
                  Up comes the creature, making straight for a car parked to face the highway and jumping
                  onto its rear end. Close-up of that windshield, through which a young man and his
                  girlfriend are seen about to enjoy one another's company. They gasp as those four
                  slender legs push off from the bodywork; pull back to show him leaping over the highway,
                  then cut to the close-up again. The two look up after him, then at each other, then
                  get right back to the business at hand.) </i>
               
               <i> (They are quickly interrupted again by the sound of the R-Cycle's engine. A shocked
                  stare and second gasp are all they can manage before <span class="char">Robin</span> speeds in and onto the car's rear end, launching himself over the highway. As he
                  sails through space, he fires off a grappling hook and is yanked away on its line,
                  letting the chopper drop. The swinging trajectory carries him toward a wall, while
                  the large R's on both sides of the plummeting R-Cycle extend outward from the body
                  and each fire a beam from underneath. Cut to street level; the vehicle descends smoothly
                  to the curb and touches down with the help of these, and the emitters retract.) </i>
               
               <i> (The camera shifts to point straight up at the sky between the buildings on opposite
                  sides of the street. The man-spider charges down the facade, followed closely by <span class="char">Robin</span>, whose line trails out ahead of him, and proceeds to climb the architecture on the
                  other side. Long shot of the rooftops, panning to follow him as he leaps from one
                  to the next. <span class="char">Robin</span>'s hook shoots after him, the line pulls taut, and he is yanked along. The chase moves
                  up yet another building, but the runner stops halfway up and spits a pair of short
                  beams down at <span class="char">Robin</span> to knock him loose. Overhead view of the street; the Boy Wonder drops toward it,
                  his skin turning gray and his limbs frozen in place.) </i>
