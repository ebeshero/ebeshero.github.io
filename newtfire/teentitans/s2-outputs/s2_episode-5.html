               <i> (Opening shot: the night sky, filled with dark storm clouds and flashes of lightning.
                  Tilt down to the exterior of a video store in Jump City; a crowd of panicking customers bursts out and breaks for cover. Inside, a clerk screams and backs across the floor. Some large thing with many long,
                  sparking appendages rears up before her, causing her to stumble down, and the camera
                  cuts to behind her to show these as coaxial cables. Tilt up to reveal the main body,
                  a large television set whose static-filled screen frames an evilly grinning face with
                  narrowed red eyes.) </i>
               
               <i> (It brings two of the cable ends together, striking an arc, and leans toward the imperiled
                  young woman; she cries out and shields her face. Now we see a close-up of a remote
                  control, its front end fashioned into a menacing creature's head, held in someone's
                  hand. The press of a button stops the big screen in its tracks, wipes out the static,
                  and leaves just a blank expression on the face. Pan to the remote's user, standing
                  atop the shelves near a wall of video screens, and cut to a close-up. Fat, long straggly hair, dressed after the fashion of Obi-Wan Kenobi in Star Wars,
                  a dark gray overcoat topping off the ensemble: this is <span class="char">Control Freak</span>.) </i>
               
               
               <p><b>Control Freak: </b> Okay. Either you admit that Warp Trek Five, which reunited the entire original cast
                  of the classic TV series, deserved to be on your "Favorite Rentals" list, or...</p>
               
               <i> (When he says the movie name, he points the remote at the screens and brings up an
                  image of a green-skinned starship crewman to make his point. After he finishes the
                  line, he aims the device toward the o.c. television monster; it comes back to life.
                  The clerk scuttles back toward the candy counter.) </i>
               
               
               <p><b>Clerk: </b> Please! I-I don't even know what Warp Trek is!</p>
               
               
               <p><b>Control Freak: </b> And that, my little tribble, is why you must be destroyed!</p>
               
               <i> (Another button pressed; the screen roars, strikes sparks from two cables, and reaches
                  toward her. She screams and dives over the counter to get out of striking range. Close-up
                  of her, behind the display and looking up fearfully; tilt up to show the thing floating
                  steadily toward her hiding place. Before it can get to her, though, a sonic cannon
                  blast drives it off to one side. <span class="char">Control Freak</span> covers his face as dust flies back from the area of its collision with the far wall.
                  He looks up with a gasp; cut to inside the entrance, where the Titans have arrived
                  on the scene and <span class="char">Cyborg</span> has his weapon at the ready. Pan slowly across the group as he disarms.) </i>
               
               [Animation goof: The cannon is on his left arm in this shot.]
               
               <i> (The overweight movie nut hops nimbly from one shelf to the next, approaching them.) </i>
               
               
               <p><b>Control Freak: </b> Well, well, well. If it isn't my old arch-nemesis...ses...the Teen Titans!</p>

               <i> (<span class="char">Cyborg</span> shrugs, equally puzzled, and both get their answer when the screens all come up showing
                  an image of <span class="char">Control Freak</span> at the click of his remote. Close-up of one.) </i>
               
               
               <p><b>Control Freak: </b> <i> (on all screens) </i> I am the master of monsters <i> (Pull back to frame more of the wall.) </i> I am your darkest nightmares come to life <i> (Pull back again.) </i> I am...<span class="char">Control Freak</span>!</p>
               
               <i> (The genuine article stands up into view on the end of this and produces applause and
                  clapping with the right button.) </i>

               <p><b>Control Freak: </b> You will be <i> (approaches the camera) </i> You will be.</p>
               
               <i> (Pull back. He laughs and fires up the controller; near <span class="char">Raven</span>, a video drop box grows considerably and turns its deposit slot into a toothy mouth.
                  She gasps and backs up from its expanding shadow as it growls in a very rusty manner.
                  Close-up of her wide-eyed, startled face, zooming in slowly, and fade to black.) </i>
               
               <i> (Fade to black.) </i>

                  growling, then cut to it as it stomps toward her. <span class="char">Cyborg</span> leaps in and hits the thing broadside with a flying shoulder to knock it away, but
                  it soon recovers and locks up with him.) </i>

               <i> (He tosses it across the store; it fetches up against several sets of shelves, and
                  he leaps in with a yell to do a little old-school clobbering.) </i>

               <i> (He aims his remote at the two cash registers; as the cowering clerk cries out in fear,
                  evil faces appear on the price displays and the handheld scanners float up of their
                  own accord. The Titans, save <span class="char">Cyborg</span>, look from here to <span class="char">Control Freak</span>, who has dropped to the floor and now brings a set of shelves to life. The video
                  boxes on the top level are red while those below are white, and most of them fall
                  away to leave the unit with two eyes and a snarling mouth. It moves in.) </i>
               
               <i> (Now the four look elsewhere and see the portly enemy twirling around the floor. Another
                  click, this one with the remote aimed under his upraised leg, and the camera shifts
                  to a large cardboard cutout of an alien in samurai armor. Its eyes glow red as it
                  brings the blade back for a swing, to the sound of the geek's laughter; cut to the
                  four bewildered Titans, then to <span class="char">Control Freak</span>, who waves derisively at them.) </i>

                  it, and leaps away. He comes down behind it and sends it flying with a well-placed
                  swing; in an instant, though, it stretches its body and strikes at him like a snake.
                  <span class="char">Robin</span> is sent flying across the room.) </i>

                  <span class="char">Starfire</span>, swooping through with the two cash registers in hot pursuit and spitting their change
                  at her. The chase swings low down one aisle as <span class="char">Beast Boy</span> backs into view at its far end. The mutated set of shelves is bearing down on him
                  here. In no time flat, he has transformed into a roaring tyrannosaurus rex; the unit
                  screams shrilly, all its "teeth" and "eyes" falling out, and he tears into it.) </i>
               
               <i> (Snap to black, which immediately resolves into <span class="char">Raven</span>'s outfit as she skids backward away from the camera. <span class="char">Control Freak</span> approaches at a leisurely pace.) </i>

                  is to work the remote, bringing them to a stop in midair.) </i>

                  of dominoes laid end to end, and wrap her up from shoulders to waist. <span class="char">Cyborg</span>, meanwhile, has hoisted up the shelving unit <span class="char">Beast Boy</span> fought, its "face" is back together, and slams it to the floor. He wipes his hands
                  smugly, but his mood quickly changes to one of surprise.) </i>

               <i> (<span class="char">Control Freak</span>, once again spinning across the floor, hits a button. Behind <span class="char">Cyborg</span>, the candy counter is affected; all the goodies leap off the shelves and come snarling
                  after him.) </i>

                  and tries to back away.) </i>

                  takes evasive action and slows down to fall in behind her. It then starts to fire
                  off coins; she is thrown briefly off balance, but gets herself under control and bounces
                  off a wall straight back at the thing. One point-blank shot puts the crazed piece
                  of retail hardware out of action for good.) </i>

                  tilt up to frame the rest of her as she picks up a coin and looks at it with a curious
                  smile. An instant later, one of the big-screen monster's cables whips into view, wraps
                  her up, and gives her a shock that forces a loud squeal out of her. She is quickly
                  hauled toward the face as <span class="char">Robin</span> backs into view, trading hits with the cardboard samurai-now back to original humanoid
                  form. It goes into a new charge, and he gets a birdarang ready. Snap to black, with
                  a brilliant white streak slashing across the screen: the weapon finding its mark,
                  then to him coming down from a leap. Behind him, the figure has stopped in its tracks.
                  He runs o.c.; after a moment, it falls apart, having been split down the middle by
                  his throw.) </i>
               
               <i> (That set of deranged shelves slides backward into view. Its "face" shows how scared
                  it is, and for good reason, as we see when <span class="char">Beast Boy</span> charges in as a bull and gores it. The thing skids farther and crashes into other
                  shelves, throwing up a curtain of dust. Out comes the green Titan, back in human form
                  and badly dazed from the collision. He staggers a bit, the camera panning to follow,
                  and stops when another cardboard cutout is partially in view. This snaps his brain
                  back into its groove; he stares silently for a second and them flails his arms with

                  from under the hem of a long, tattered robe. Tilt up to show the rest of the figure;
