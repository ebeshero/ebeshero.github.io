               <i> (Opening shot: the sun gradually brightening against a black screen. When the view is fully illuminated, we see a rocky landscape, with outcroppings on
                  either side of a broad canyon. It is not long after sunrise. Tilt down slightly to
                  an overhead view of a large scorpion racing toward the first bend, then cut to a close-up
                  of a young girl who runs as if trying to beat the devil in the hundred-yard dash.
                  Seen from the shoulders down, she is very thin, with spindly arms and legs, and roughly the same age as the Titans.
                  Her clothing consists of denim shorts, a light gray long-sleeved shirt, and a dark
                  gray crop top with black sleeves over this. Her hair is long, blond, and straight,
                  and she wears thick brown leather gloves and hiking boots. This is Terra) </i>
               
               <i> (The camera shifts to frame all of her from behind; this shot reveals that she is heading
                  toward the shore of Jump City Bay and Titans Tower. A butterfly-shaped hair clip can now be seen over her right ear. She turns to look
                  over her shoulder as the pursuer's shadow falls over her, revealing large, light blue
                  eyes that broadcast her fear quite clearly. The scorpion has nearly closed the gap
                  and works its mandibles in anticipation of a meal. As <span class="char">Terra</span> charges ahead, the giant tail is lifted for a strike; it comes down inches from her
                  and throws her off balance. She skids across the ground and rubs her head, finding
                  that her hair clip has been knocked loose to fall nearby. As she reaches for it, that
                  enormous stinger punches into the dirt and again just misses her; she is off and running
                  in an instant, with the creature giving chase.) </i>
               
               <i> (Now she swerves to avoid an outcropping, which is destroyed by a sweep of the scorpion's
                  claws, and vaults over a lower formation to keep ahead. She runs flat out, and the
                  camera cuts to an overhead view and pans quickly ahead to her, then farther ahead
                  to show a dead end not too distant. Cut to it; she stops at the wall of rock and turns
                  to find the beast's shadow falling over her. She cowers against the sheer face as
                  the scorpion prepares to lunge. However, it looks up instead, and the camera tilts
                  up quickly to the ledge on one side of the canyon.<span class="char">Robin</span>leaps down onto it from above. A quick flash of the sun as the camera pulls back,
                  and the other four Titans have joined him there;<span class="char">Beast Boy</span>has become a wolf.) </i>

               <i> (Before any of them can move, though, a tremor shakes the ground. Cut to<span class="char">Terra</span> whose eyes are now glowing yellow and whose mouth has assumed a cruel smile; her
                  hair blows all around her. The rock beneath the Titans' feet begins to crack and shift,
                  and one end of a natural bridge across the canyon breaks loose and is lifted into
                  the air. Pan to the other side to show that end pulling free as well. Pull back to
                  ground level; she raises her hands and groans with the effort as the slab goes higher
                  and higher. Now her hands are glowing as well: this is her own particular superpower
                  at work. Finally, she brings them down, and the rock drops squarely on top of the
                  scorpion to crush it flat. One final tail spasm and scream of pain, and the thing
                  falls silent.) </i>

Cut to just behind<span class="char">Terra</span>and zoom in slowly on the smashed robots lying among the rocks in front of her. One
                  of them starts to crawl out, its bottom half is gone, and others get to their feet
                  and advance as well. Her ruined goggles now hanging around her neck, she gathers herself
                  for a mighty effort; once again her eyes and fists glow yellow, white light surrounds
                  her, and columns of stone descend from the ceiling to crush every robot. The last
                  spasm of movement is from a sparking hand. When it stops, she runs off into the tunnel.) </i>

               <i> (A cut to farther down that tunnel gives the answer. Winded and exhausted, she stumbles
                  over to a wall and leans against it for support. After a moment to catch her breath,
                  she slides down to the ground and looks at her hands.) </i>
               
               
               <p><b>Terra: </b> Why can't I do this?</p>
               
               <i> (Extreme close-up; her eyes are squeezed shut. Echoing, running footsteps from o.c.
                  draw her attention. Long shot of a junction with another tunnel, where a figure dashes
                  past.) </i>

               <i> (In a closer shot, we see that she has correctly identified the runner. She goes after
                  him as fast as her legs will carry her. After a few hundred yards, she skids to a
                  stop and raises one hand to cave in the ceiling just ahead of him. Now she walks up,
                  both hands glowing.) </i>

               <i> (A huge leap gets him airborne and deposits him just behind her, and with a swift low
                  kick he dumps her to the ground. Straightening up, he produces a sphere with his insignia
                  on it.) </i>

               <i> (He throws it upward; it sticks to the ceiling and starts to beep as a red light flashes.
                  She gets to her feet.) </i>

               <i> (The device explodes in a mighty blast that wipes out the entire view. When it clears,
                  more rocks are falling from the ceiling behind him and<span class="char">Terra</span>has been floored again by the shock wave. Clouds of dust wash over the screen as the
                  view fades to black.) </i>
               
               <i> (Fade in to a shot of<span class="char">Slade</span>walking implacably away from this second cave-in. Emergency lights switch on at the
                  bases of the tunnel walls, bathing the enclosed space in eerie yellow-green light.
                  His approaching silhouette puts fresh fear into<span class="char">Terra</span> who scuttles backward a little bit and finds herself staring directly into that black-and-red-orange
                  masked face. Fade to black.) </i>

               <i> (He tries a jab, but she dodges easily and counters by launching a stone at him from
                  the wall. It zips past him, a near miss.) </i>
               
               
               <p><b>Slade: </b> Hmm. I see we have much to talk about.</p>

               <i> (Fragments fly as she causes two large stone snakes to emerge, one from each wall.
                  They hurtle toward<span class="char">Slade's</span> position, but he dives to avoid being crushed between them. He ends up in a kneeling
                  crouch at her feet.) </i>
               
               
               <p><b>Slade: </b> Good,<span class="char">Terra</span> but not good enough.</p>
               
               <i> (He swings the staff and follows up with a jab; she sidesteps both attacks and somersaults
                  away. An overhead swing also misses its mark when she rolls out of range. Before she
                  can move again, he brings the staff down to cut off her anticipated movement. Hands
                  to head, she huddles on the ground under his next descending blow, and a chunk of
                  rock surges up from the ground to send him staggering backward across the tunnel.) </i>
               
               <i> (<span class="char">Terra</span>, still behind this makeshift shield, peers cautiously around the edge and sees<span class="char">Slade</span>approaching. She steps out and heaves the mass toward him; planting the end of his
                  staff in the ground, he swings himself up along its length. The rock hits the staff
                  and breaks it, but leaves him untouched. As it crashes into the wall, he regains his
                  footing.) </i>
               
               
               <p><b>Slade: </b> Impressive, unless, of course, you were aiming for me.</p>
               
               <i> (He drops the piece of the staff he is still holding and advances slowly toward her.
                  She backs up a bit and launches several medium-size stones from the tunnel wall at
                  him. A mighty punch shatters the biggest of them, and as she sends out another volley,
                  he moves in and knocks several out of the air. Now she slings a colossal boulder at
                  him, but one blow smashes it and drives her back against the wall in the bargain.
                  She collapses to the ground.) </i>
               
               
               <p><b>Terra: </b> Back off</p>
               
               <i> (She stands up.) </i> I'm with the Titans! They'll be coming to--

               <i> (He produces her missing hair clip in that hand-evidently he palmed it after the prologue,
                  and her face goes slack when she sees it.) </i>

               <i> (Pull back a bit; he releases his hold.) </i> And everywhere you fail
               
               <i> (leans to her) </i> So everyone turns against you.
               
               <i> (Back to her. She has turned her face away, and without the clip, her hair has once
                  again fallen forward to obscure its right half.) </i>
               
               
               <p><b>Slade: </b> <i> (from o.c.) </i> You lack control, <span class="char">Terra</span></p>
               
               <i> (reaches into frame to replace hair clip) </i> And when you lose control, you are more dangerous than anything I've ever seen.
               
               <i> (She looks up at him wonderingly; he turns away.) </i>

               <p><b>Slade: </b> <i> (from o.c.) </i> Right now, you are...rough around the edges.</p>
               
               <i> (On the end of this, cut to her. He holds the stone into view, and the camera shifts
                  back to him.) </i>
               
               
               <p><b>Slade: </b> You need more than obstacle courses to overcome your problem.</p>
               
               <i> (Pan to his hand; he squeezes the stone viciously, and it starts to crumble.) </i>
               
               
               <p><b>Slade: </b> <i> (from o.c.) </i> You need a teacher. A mentor.

               <i> (He opens his fist on the end of this line, revealing a diamond in his palm: it had
                  been hidden at the center of the rock. She looks on, completely befuddled, then up
                  at him, and finally backs away.) </i>
