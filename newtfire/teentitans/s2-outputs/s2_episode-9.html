                  for a few seconds before <span class="char">Robin</span> makes his play. The card he throws down shows a funnel cloud; he leans back confidently

                  paneling tell that it is nighttime in this place. A sudden flash leaves the three boys standing here and very confused; another one
                  rips through, and suddenly, they are not alone. Joining them, just as flummoxed, are
                  <span class="char">Gizmo</span> and <span class="char">Aqualad</span>, along with three other teenage males. One is human, with short red-blond hair, a mask similar to <span class="char">Robin</span>'s, a sleeveless, dark red tunic marked with an S over the heart, matching wrist guards
                  and pants, a yellow belt, and a quiver of arrows slung on his back; this is <span class="char">Speedy</span>. Another wears a black outfit trimmed with red, and his skin appears to be transparent
                  and filled with fire; this is <span class="char">Hot Spot</span>. The last is <span class="char">Wildebeest</span>; very tall, muscular, broad-shouldered, with the head of the creature for which he

                  as a loincloth-like garment similar to that worn by Roman soldiers. The chest and
