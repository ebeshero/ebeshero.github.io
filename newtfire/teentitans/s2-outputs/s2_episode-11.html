               <i> (Opening shot: the rooftops of Jump City at night, under a driving rain. Cut to ground level, the camera moving swiftly down the street to the sound of a
                  motorcycle engine. A laser blast flashes into view and blows out a streetlight; pull
                  back as the shooter streaks down the block on his chopper, which is red and black.
                  Seen from behind, he has gray skin, long black hair under a steel helmet, and jagged
                  stripe tattoos of the same color on muscular arms that extend from his sleeveless
                  black T-shirt. This is <span class="char">Johnny Rancid</span>.) </i>
               
               
               <p><b>Rancid: </b> Yeah!</p>
               
               <i> (He laughs and shoots out more lights as exhaust fumes drift over the pavement.) </i>
               
               
               <p><b>Rancid: </b> Boom!</p>
               
               <i> (Close-up. Rather an unsavory-looking motorcycle thug.) </i>
               
               
               <p><b>Rancid: </b> <i> (scraps his blaster's barrel on the street) </i> Yeah! Whoo-hoo!</p>
               
               <i> (More laughter as he approaches the camera; he then pulls back, brings up a weapon
                  in each hand, and fires at will.) </i>
               
               
               <p><b>Rancid: </b> Yeah!</p>
               
               <i> (A young man and woman approach their car, parked at the curb, only to see it blown
                  away by <span class="char">Rancid</span>'s barrage. The girl screams and both run for cover as the phone booth near them gets
                  it, and he zooms past the area.) </i>
               
               
               <p><b>Rancid: </b> That's right! Run and hide! The streets belong to <span class="char">Johnny Rancid</span>!</p>
               
               <i> (A second engine revs o.c.; he looks ahead, and the camera shifts to point up between
                  the buildings from ground level. That sound came from <span class="char">Robin</span>'s R-Cycle, plunging to the street with him on it. <span class="char">Rancid</span>'s eyes pop at the sight, and he guns the engine to pull ahead and avoid having all
                  that weight come down on his head. <span class="char">Robin</span> hits the street at a distance; both riders put their wheels into a tearing skid and
                  stop facing each other. Close-up of <span class="char">Robin</span>'s wheel, then tilt up to frame him.) </i>
               
               
               <p><span class="robin">Robin: </span> End of the road, Johnny.</p>
               
               
               <p><b>Rancid: </b> <span class="char">Robin</span>, a little birdie name for a little birdie boy. You can't stop me. <i> (He revs up and pops a wheelie.) </i> You can't even catch me!</p>
               
               <i> (Robin looks as if he would like to make <span class="char">Rancid</span> eat that bike; laughing, the street tough peels out past him, and he flips onto his
                  own rear wheel and starts the chase. Lightning tears the stormy sky as <span class="char">Rancid</span> hunches over his handlebars and starts shooting at <span class="char">Robin</span>. <span class="char">The Boy Wonder</span> swerves to avoid the blasts, fishes out a couple of discs, and hurls them ahead.
                  Two well-placed shots blow them to dust.) </i>
               
               
               <p><b>Rancid: </b> Awww. Did big bad Johnny break the birdie's favorite toys?</p>
               
               <i> (He speeds ahead; <span class="char">Robin</span> feeds gas and tries to catch up. Off they go around a corner, with <span class="char">Robin</span> pulling almost even with <span class="char">Rancid</span>. The armed hooligan levels a blaster and fires off a new volley; one shot ricochets
                  off the R-Cycle's windshield, while <span class="char">Robin</span> steers expertly to dodge the others. He comes up on the other side and <span class="char">Rancid</span> draws a new bead, but <span class="char">Robin</span> strikes the gun from his hand and rams his chassis against the red-and-black one.) </i>
               
               [Animation goof: One of the forearm tattoos briefly turns red in this shot.]
               
               <i> (Pull back. <span class="char">Rancid</span> has been forced almost to the sidewalk. He nearly collides with a stack of crates,
                  then kicks one loose from the next group he passes. It breaks open, releasing a great
                  many oranges to go tumbling toward <span class="char">Robin</span>; a few smash on his helmet and windshield, and he looks up through the pulp to find
                  <span class="char">Rancid</span> at close-quarters. The thug steers against the R-Cycle, causing it to overbalance.
                  Both it and <span class="char">Robin</span> slide across the pavement as <span class="char">Rancid</span> stops for a moment.) </i>
               
               
               <p><b>Rancid: </b> Looks like you still need training wheels!</p>
               
               <i> (He is off again, leaving the Titan to pound the pavement with a frustrated groan.
                  A flash of lightning fills the screen and clears to show a patch of dark sky. Pull back to show it over the bridge that spans Jump City Bay. Another strike, and we are in the street again; <span class="char">Rancid</span> drives into view from around a corner, the camera panning to follow his turn onto
                  a parallel road as <span class="char">Robin</span> gets after him once more. They are heading for the bridge.) </i>
               
               
               <p><b>Rancid: </b> You can't fight, you can't ride, and you can't win!</p>
               
               <i> (Now on the bridge, he pops a wheelie and runs his bike straight up the rear end of
                  a nearby car. The elevation boost allows him to slide onto one of the suspension cables.
                  <span class="char">Robin</span> widens his eyes at this feat of handling, then proceeds to match it. Up the incline
                  they go, headlights blazing in the torrential storm, as the camera pulls back and
                  dissolves to a long shot of the bridge. A lightning strike puts us back on the cable.) </i>
               
               
               <p><b>Rancid: </b> Face it, Bird-Boy. You're just a stupid little kid!</p>
               
               <i> (He races ahead. This insult hits <span class="char">Robin</span> exactly the wrong way, judging from his gritted teeth. <span class="char">Rancid</span> pops a wheelie as he reaches the column to which the cable is attached and launches
                  himself high over its top. Just as before, <span class="char">Robin</span> stares wide-eyed and matches the move. Cut briefly to a midair shot of the two riders,
                  <span class="char">Robin</span> starting to descend from his impossible jump, then to a head-on view of <span class="char">Rancid</span>. Pull back as he brings his wheels down neatly on the high end of a different cable
                  and rides down. In midair, the R-Cycle is dropping fast, but when <span class="char">Robin</span>'s face comes into view, his eyes are bugging out with fear. The camera shifts behind
                  him to reveal that he is about to have a head-on collision with one of the columns.) </i>
               
               <i> (Cut to a long shot of the bridge. An explosion at the pinnacle marks the crash and is accompanied by <span class="char">Rancid</span>'s derisive laughter from o.c. Fade to black.) </i>
               
               
               <i> (OPENING THEME) </i>
               
               <i> (The words are in Japanese, but the primary melody is not sung by Puffy AmiYumi. Rather,
                  the voice is male, high, and having a hard time staying on pitch Rocky Toy-C. At every
                  Teen Titans shout, a short, fat, bucktoothed fellow rides across the screen on a little
                  chopper that matches the design of the R-Cycle. His helmet copies <span class="char">Robin</span>'s as well, and he is dressed like the Boy Wonder. However, his bike, helmet, and
                  tunic are all marked with an L rather than an R; the last two items have their L's
                  in a square, rather than the circle on <span class="char">Robin</span>'s gear. The original harmony vocals kick in for the second half of the second verse.
                  The final Teen Titans, at the end of the sequence, is whispered and accompanied by
                  the little guy's head popping into the frame. This individual will later be identified
                  as <span class="char">Nosyarg Kcid</span>, then as <span class="char">Larry</span>.) </i>

In the operations center, <span class="char">Raven</span> raises one glowing hand and holds it palm first toward the camera; cut to <span class="char">Robin</span> on the couch.
