               <p><b>Terra: </b> <i> (voice over) </i> My name is <span class="char">Terra</span>, and I have done horrible things.</p>
               
               <i> (A towering image of <span class="char">Slade</span>, wreathed in flames, fades into view behind her.) </i>
               
               
               <p><b>Terra: </b> <i> (voice over) </i> I have sworn to serve a dark master. <i> (He raises one hand.) </i> I have obeyed his every command, <i> (It curls to a fist.) </i> and committed crimes in his name.</p>
               
               <i> (A lick of fire washes across the screen. When it clears, the view has shifted to a street in Jump City. Ranks of commando robots march along under the glow of sunset. From here, cut to
                  a black screen against which a vertical panel floats down; within it, the heart-shaped
                  box given to <span class="char">Terra</span> by <span class="char">Beast Boy</span> in "Betrayal" slowly falls. Fullscreen: more robots, matching the design of the secondary
                  black-and-white ones that attacked the Titans in "Masks", but with gray armor, are
                  on the march. The single panel again; now the lid flips open to expose the mirror
                  on its inner surface. Head-on view of both groups of robots, advancing in a single
                  body through the misty street, then the panel again. The box slowly shatters as it
                  reaches the bottom edge, after which we see a shot of <span class="char">Terra</span> in her Titan outfit. This cracks down the middle, the two halves falling together
                  to leave only the left half of her face exposed, a parallel for the way she now styles
                  her hair to hide the right side.) </i>
               
               <i> (The street again. Behind the marching androids, she rises into view on a piece of
                  pavement and floats overhead. Cut to a close outer-space view of part of the Earth's
                  surface; an image of his insignia is marked in one spot, and red-orange arrows extend
                  in all directions to represent his growing dominion. As they cross the shorelines,
                  the planet fades away to leave a black screen behind it all; cut to an overhead view
                  of a wide gorge. One by one, the Titans drop into it on the next line.) </i>
               
               
               <p><b>Terra: </b> <i> (voice over) </i> I have betrayed and attacked everyone who used to be my friend. <i> (She fades into view; the gorge closes.) </i> One by one, I have destroyed the Teen Titans.</p>
               
               <i> (Zoom in slightly on the end of this; her hands glow threateningly. Dissolve to a long
                  shot of her above the Jump City streets and pull back slowly. Shadowed outlines of fleeing people stand frozen in terror.) </i>
               
               
               <p><b>Terra: </b> <i> (voice over) </i> And with no one left to stop me...</p>
               
               <i> (Rumbling, followed by geysers of mud and stone dust, then a long shot of another ravaged
                  block. Wrecked cars are strewn about in the fog. Pull back slowly.) </i>
               
               
               <p><b>Terra: </b> <i> (voice over) </i> ...I have brought an entire city to its knees.</p>
               
               <i> (Slade's robots continue their unstoppable march, emerging from the dusty haze to approach
                  the camera. Cut to each of the following in turn. <span class="char">Robin</span> falling into the shadows. A slow pan across an empty street. <span class="char">Cyborg</span> falling. The commandos moving on. <span class="char">Raven</span> falling. <span class="char">Terra</span> standing before the flaming image of <span class="char">Slade</span>. <span class="char">Starfire</span> falling. The commandos. <span class="char">Beast Boy</span> falling.) </i>
               
               <i> (The screen remains black after he has dropped out of sight; against it, <span class="char">Terra</span> fades into view once more.) </i>
               
               
               <p><b>Terra: </b> <i> (voice over) </i> My name is <span class="char">Terra</span>. I have done horrible things.</p>
               
               <i> (Dissolve to an extreme close-up of <span class="char">Slade</span>'s eye and zoom in slowly toward its pupil.) </i>
               
               
               <p><b>Terra: </b> <i> (voice over) </i> And I have absolutely no regrets.</p>
               
               <i> (By now, the camera has passed through that black spot. She emerges from the darkness
                  and fixes the camera with a long, implacable glare before the screen snaps to black.) </i>

               <i> (Opening shot: a slow roof-level pan through Jump City. The fog obscuring the sky makes
                  it impossible to tell what time of day it is. Dissolve to a group of pay phones, all
                  off the hook, and pan across the deserted street. The next dissolve puts us at a curb;
                  a couple of cars sit abandoned by the parking meters as wisps of dust and fog drift
                  past. Long shot of the wreck-strewn block seen in the prologue, pulling back slowly.) </i>
               
               <i> (Cut to a battalion of the secondary robots. They stride across the street, leaving
                  commandos at attention on both sidewalks. Overhead view of the block, tilting ahead
                  of these massed advancing forces to show even more troops on the go. The view shifts
                  slightly and flickers with a bit of static; pull back to show <span class="char">Slade</span> watching it and other angles on a wall of monitors in his stained-glass-windowed
                  lair.) </i>
               
               
               <p><b>Slade: </b> A world without Titans. <i> (<span class="char">Overload</span> stands behind him.) </i> I was beginning to think I'd never see the day. <i> (Slow pan; <span class="char">Cinderblock</span> and <span class="char">Plasmus</span> are on his other side.) </i> But at long last, the city is ours, and victory is mine.</p>
               
               <i> (Cut to <span class="char">Terra</span>, riding her pavement platform slowly down, both arms tucked behind her back.) </i>
               
               
               <p><b>Slade: </b> <i> (heard in the receiver plugged into <span class="char">Terra</span>'s ear) </i> Fine work, apprentice. You have made me very proud.</p>
               
               
               <p><b>Terra: </b> Thanks. It was fun.</p>
               
               <i> (She passes the camera; behind the trailing edge of her hair, the view changes to show
                  her cruising down a street under that sick gray-black sky. A sound of young laughter;
                  the Titans brings her up short, and the blond bulldozer's image dissolves to one of
                  her in the old black/yellow-orange outfit. The sky behind her is clear and blue now,
                  and <span class="char">Beast Boy</span>'s hand reaches up to plant itself on her shoulder. She joins in the laughter.) </i>
               
               <i> (Pull back. All six are around an outdoor table at the team's favorite pizza joint,
                  with stacks of empty boxes everywhere. The tallest sits by <span class="char">Cyborg</span>, whose arm is held aloft by <span class="char">Starfire</span>, while <span class="char">Raven</span> just sits and reads. That burst of laughter was from <span class="char">Terra</span>'s memory, and we have gone back to the day of a pizza-eating contest that the big
                  man has just won handily. <span class="char">Beast Boy</span> looks very ill, while <span class="char">Robin</span> waves a white flag in surrender.) </i>
               
               <i> (Dissolve back to the present day; the table stands unused in the mist. <span class="char">Terra</span> eyes it for a long moment before speaking.) </i>
               
               
               <p><b>Terra: </b> Sector Five is secure. Pretty quiet up here since all the people cleared out.</p>
               
               
               <p><b>Slade: </b> Get used to it, my dear. This city is only the first of many. <i> (She starts away.) </i></p>
               
               
               <p><b>Terra: </b> I know.</p>
               
               <i> (She continues down the silent street. Pan across the building facades, whose windows
                  show her passing, stolid reflection, not a person in sight, and stop on a set of double
                  doors. Dissolve to put them in color, another flashback; <span class="char">the Amazing Mumbo</span> kicks them open, sacks of cash in hand, and runs off laughing. He has just pulled
                  a bank job. <span class="char">Robin</span> and <span class="char">Beast Boy</span> run out after him, and the camera pulls back across the street. Before the mad magician
                  can set foot on the opposite sidewalk, a huge stone fist shoots up, seizes him in
                  an unbreakable grip, and hoists him up o.c. After it has gone, the view clears to
                  show <span class="char">Cyborg</span>, <span class="char">Starfire</span>, and <span class="char">Raven</span> looking on as well, and amid a fluttering shower of loose bills, <span class="char">Terra</span> steps into view to look up at her work.) </i>

               Go! comic series "Magic &amp; Misdirection."]
               
               <i> (A bill drifts past, very near the camera, and behind its trailing edge the view changes
                  to the bank entrance, seen from across the street in the present day. <span class="char">Terra</span> floats past it and the commandos stationed on the sidewalk; she is now deep in thought
                  over these past moments. She passes a tree; behind it, the view changes to another
                  memory; she laughs and walks through the park with <span class="char">Beast Boy</span>.) </i>

               <i> (They pass another tree, behind which the view changes to the present. She continues
                  her patrol, eyeing the troops, and stops amid a group of secondary robots. All are
                  facing the Tower, standing alone and dark in the mist that covers Jump City Bay.) </i>

                  combo. The explosion sends <span class="char">Terra</span> sliding across the pavement; groaning in pain, she tries to lift her head.) </i>

               <i> (She follows orders, smashing their position to rubble, but when the dust clears, all
                  it reveals is a car that has been flipped upside down by the tremors. Panicking a
                  bit, she backs up and looks left and right, that curtain of hair over her right eye
                  swinging heavily with the motion. In the fog behind her, a large wolf-like shape races
                  by; an instant later, two booted feet pass in front. Now <span class="char">Terra</span> is really rattled, but her attention is distracted and she does not notice the big,
                  broad human shape coming up fast to throw a punch. <span class="char">Cyborg</span> catches her squarely in the back; the blow sends her down the street a bit, and as
                  soon as she gets up, a starbolt hits her broadside.) </i>
               
               [Recurring animation goof: From now until the end of the episode, the insignia on
               Terra's breastplate will occasionally reverse colors.]

                  of range, but another of <span class="char">Starfire</span>'s shots blows it apart under her feet. The caped outline of <span class="char">Robin</span> leaps high and hurls a handful of grenades down at her; she raises a rock sheet to
                  stop their explosions from reaching her, only to be flattened by <span class="char">Cyborg</span>'s cannon shot. Zoom in slightly on her.) </i>

                  is cut off when an enormous black hand reaches up from behind and seizes her. <span class="char">Raven</span>'s "soul-self" emerges entirely, carrying <span class="char">Terra</span> high into the air. Close-up of the apprentice's face, whose eyes register undiluted
                  fear and then narrow as the yellow glow starts anew. A stone spike shoots up to knock
                  her out of the apparition's grip, and she rises on a piece of it, but the silhouette
                  of <span class="char">Beast Boy</span>, once again a wolf, streaks across and plows her away.) </i>
