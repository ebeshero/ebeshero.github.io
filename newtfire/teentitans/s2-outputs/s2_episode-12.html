               <i> (Opening shot: a stained-glass window, such as might be found in a cathedral, seen
                  from inside. Orange-tinted sunlight shines through the panes into the dim chamber. Pull back in
                  steps to reveal more of the interior; a collapsed jumble of steel beams betrays the
                  fact that this place, wherever it is, has not been used in quite some time. Cut to
                  a slow pan along a row of windows. <span class="char">Slade</span> stands at one of them and turns to address the camera. Since his throw down with
                  <span class="char">Beast Boy</span> in "Betrayal", he has had a chance to replace his mask and armor.) </i>
               
               
               <p><b>Slade: </b> You have had doubts in the past. Made mistakes.</p>
               
               <i> (Cut to <span class="char">Terra</span> at another window. Seen in profile from the waist up, she stands with head bowed
                  and eyes closed. The black and yellow-orange outfit she sported in her last outing
                  with the Titans has been replaced by a very different rig: steel breastplate and shoulder/elbow
                  pads, a layer of cloth wrappings under the armor to cover her entire body, black codpiece,
                  a metal hair clip above the left ear.) </i>
               
               
               <p><b>Slade: </b> <i> (from o.c.) </i> But all that is behind you, isn't it?</p>
               
               <i> (Extreme close-up; she opens her eyes and lifts her face.) </i>
               
               
               <p><b>Terra: </b> Yes. <i> (Long shot, silhouette.) </i></p>
               
               
               <p><b>Slade: </b> <i> (from o.c.) </i> You belong to me now... <i> (steps into a view near the camera) </i> ...don't you? <i> (Close-up of his eye.) </i></p>
               
               
               <p><b>Terra: </b> <i> (from o.c.) </i> I do. <i> (Cut to her; he walks around behind.) </i></p>
               
               
               <p><b>Slade: </b> From this day forward, will you serve me and me only?</p>
               
               <i> (She turns her head slightly to look at him over her shoulder. The movement reveals
                  a second clip over her right ear, as well as the hair that has fallen forward to hide
                  that side of her face. Close-up of her, tilting up slightly to his face.) </i>
               
               
               <p><b>Terra: </b> I will.</p>
               
               <i> (She raises her hands, now clad in thick steel gloves like his. Close-up profile of
                  him.) </i>
               
               
               <p><b>Slade: </b> Will you obey my every command? <i> (Tilt down a bit; she steps forth.) </i></p>
               
               
               <p><b>Terra: </b> I will. <i> (Pull back to frame both.) </i></p>
               
               
               <p><b>Slade: </b> Will you fight at my side forever?</p>
               
               <i> (He holds out one hand, palm up, and she stares into it. Close-up: he has a disc marked
                  with his S insignia. She gives him a hard look, takes the item after a bit of hesitation,
                  and holds it over her breastplate.) </i>
               
               
               <p><b>Terra: </b> I will. <i> (She fixes it in place.) </i></p>
               
               
               <p><b>Slade: </b> And will you destroy the Teen Titans?</p>
               
               <i> (He looks searchingly at her. Close-up of her feet, now in steel boots, and tilt up
                  past her steel-padded knees to her head.) </i>
               
               
               <p><b>Terra: </b> I thought you'd never ask.</p>
               
               <i> (Cut to a close-up of her face, mouth curving up into a cruel smile, then to a silhouetted
                  shot of master and servant at the window. Pull back slowly and snap to black.) </i>

               <i> (Opening shot: a street in  Jump City during the day. A vehicle motors down the block; in close-up, it is seen to be the T-Car. On the
                  next line, cut to a pan across the Titans inside. <span class="char">Robin</span> rides shotgun next to <span class="char">Cyborg</span>.) </i>
               
               
               <p><span class="beastBoy">Beast Boy: </span> Okay, okay, I got one. Why are ducks so funny? <i> (Cut to <span class="char">Cyborg</span>; he continues o.c.) </i> Because they're always quacking jokes!</p>
               
               <i> (To the sound of his laughter, pan toward the back seats as <span class="char">Cyborg</span> and <span class="char">Robin</span> groan softly, then cut to just outside <span class="char">Raven</span>'s window.) </i>
               
               
               <p><span class="raven">Raven: </span> Pull over. I think I'm gonna be sick.</p>

               <p><span class="starfire">Starfire: </span> Oh, I see! It is humorous because ducks lack the large brain necessary for the telling

               <p><span class="robin">Robin: </span> <i> (from o.c.) </i> Actually, <span class="char">Starfire</span>, it just wasn't humorous.</p>
               
               
               <p><span class="beastBoy">Beast Boy: </span> Huh? <i> (Outside <span class="char">Raven</span>'s window.) </i></p>

               <i> (Cut to a stoplight, which shows yellow and then red, and tilt down to street level
                  on the next line as the T-Car rolls up and brakes.) </i>
               
               
               <p><span class="raven">Raven: </span> <i> (from o.c.) </i> To beat up the idiot telling jokes about him? <i> (Close-up of the windshield; the two boys in the front seats laugh at this one.) </i></p>

               <i> (Cut to behind the auto; <span class="char">Beast Boy</span>'s frustrated groan makes itself heard and the light turns green. As the T-Car rolls
                  through the intersection, a boulder slides into view along the cross street and bulldozes
                  it away. <span class="char">Cyborg</span>'s pride and joy tumbles over and over, the windshield cracking, and skids upright
                  to a stop in a horrible scream of smoldering rubber. Letterbox view, top third of
                  the screen; it glows brightly from within due to <span class="char">Starfire</span>'s efforts, and her door is blasted away just before the engine explodes and throws
                  a piece of itself toward the camera.) </i>
               
               <i> (Fullscreen, driver's side: she climbs out, groaning and rubbing her head, and <span class="char">Cyborg</span> opens his door. As soon as he steps to the street, it falls off the hinges and both
                  Titans stare ahead in surprise. Pan to the front end as the other three emerge bug-eyed;
                  <span class="char">Beast Boy</span> is the first to find his power of speech again.) </i>

               <i> (With a fierce yell, she raises her hands and brings them forward; many small chunks
                  of stone rise from the pavement and rocket toward the Titans. All five bail out, leaving
                  the T-Car to absorb the full bombardment. Glass, headlights, tires, frame, and body
                  panels all are mercilessly battered and smashed hopelessly out of shape. <span class="char">Beast Boy</span> has taken cover behind the large rock she first slung at them; its sudden ascension
                  takes him by surprise.) </i>

               <i> (He turns just in time to see it make a perfect one-point landing on the car, crushing
                  it flat. Now <span class="char">Terra</span> focuses her powers on the section of pavement beneath her feet and gets herself airborne
                  to zoom straight at the team.) </i>

Cut to an overhead shot of <span class="char">Terra</span> skimming her platform along the street; tilt down slightly to frame a long fissure
                  forming ahead of her. It rapidly widens while racing toward the Titans, and a huge
                  stone pillar rises to push <span class="char">Robin</span> and <span class="char">Raven</span> out of sight. The other three heroes continue their rush, <span class="char">Starfire</span> blasting away, but a boulder flies into view and knocks her backward.) </i>
               
               <i> (<span class="char">Cyborg</span> shoots one worried look back toward her, then trains his sonic cannon on <span class="char">Terra</span> and fires. The blast chops away part of her paving fragment and puts her off balance
                  for a moment; however, she quickly regains control and sends the broken piece down
                  at the two remaining Titans. It crashes into <span class="char">Cyborg</span>'s face and floors him, but <span class="char">Beast Boy</span> jumps away and becomes a falcon in midair. A fast swoop puts him in her face, at
                  which point he reverts to human form and hauls himself over her leading edge.) </i>

                  with an uppercut that knocks him clear. <span class="char">Starfire</span> catches him just short of the ground; behind her, <span class="char">Terra</span> flashes past and flips backward off her stone, leaving it to continue riderless.
                  Cut to <span class="char">Robin</span>, who has fallen near the T-Car's wreckage and been knocked out from the hard landing.
                  The mass slams down, bouncing over him, and she soon comes down after it.) </i>
               
               <i> (Close-up of him, tilting up to frame her a short distance away. She directs a vicious
                  smile at the prone Titan and levitates two large stones to crush him. As he starts
                  to sit up, the weights are lifted higher and moved directly over his head, but before
                  she can drop them, <span class="char">Raven</span> touches down and levitates a third stone. Close-up of each girl in turn.) </i>

               <i> (<span class="char">Raven</span>'s stone moves behind the blond head, but her hold on it is suddenly broken and <span class="char">Terra</span> sends all three boulders straight at her. The impact, just inches short, throws her
                  far down the block; she grabs a lamppost to slow down, spins on it at high speed,
                  and ends up hurtling down the street anyway. The friction of her contact with the
                  metal weakens it to the point that the section of the post above that spot topples
                  into the street.) </i>
               
               <i> (Back to <span class="char">Terra</span>. A swing of the o.c. <span class="char">Robin</span>'s arm knocks hers away, and in an instant, he has charged at her. The two swing at
                  each other energetically; <span class="char">Cyborg</span> leaps in to help double-team her, but she promptly kicks both boys away in opposite
                  directions. As soon as <span class="char">Robin</span> is on his feet, the pavement before him erupts into a jagged wall that blocks his
                  approach and stretches far down the block in both directions.) </i>

                  of debris tumble past him, followed by the human bulldozer herself. <span class="char">Robin</span>'s bomb has blown a hole in the wall.) </i>

               <i> (She kicks him away, breaking the staff, and flips up to her feet. Cut to him, leaping
                  away from the melee; the ground starts to tremble, and the camera cuts back to her,
                  striding toward him, on the next line.) </i>

                  fissures that send up curtains of dust and wind.) </i>

               <i> (A flick of her hand aims a boulder toward him. It crashes down just to one side, but
                  the shock wave puts him down. As he struggles to rise, she continues her steady approach
                  and directs a second stone; this one also lands short and knocks him flat. He labors
                  for breath after taking the one-two punch; cut to his perspective, she stands over
                  him and raises both hands.) </i>

               <i> (The hands come down. Pan slightly to put a third boulder in view, floating above the
                  camera, then dropping straight toward it. There is a flash of white upon impact, which
                  subsides to show a patch of floor under a spotlight. Skidding into view to stop near
                  the camera is a circular black disc marked with a big yellow R: <span class="char">Robin</span>'s insignia, pried from his tunic. Pull back; <span class="char">Slade</span> reaches into view and picks it up, this is his lair, and the camera shifts to frame
                  <span class="char">Terra</span> and the three prison escapees standing at a short distance. <span class="char">Overload</span> has put his body back together since his fight with <span class="char">Raven</span>.) </i>

               <i> (On the end of this line, the camera stops on the silhouettes of the four Titans at
                  the far end; they have all survived <span class="char">Terra</span>'s onslaughts, and one of <span class="char">Starfire</span>'s hands glows green as a torch.) </i>

                  voice. <span class="char">Raven</span> has cleaned up nicely after her extended mud bath. <span class="char">Starfire</span> raises her lit hand a bit higher; cut to a close-up of the fifth Titan's face, eyebrows
                  lowered in icy determination. He, too, is in one piece after getting bashed with that
                  boulder, though his clothes are a bit torn.) </i>
