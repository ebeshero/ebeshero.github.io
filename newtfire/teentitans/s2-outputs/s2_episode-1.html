               <i> (Opening shot: the exterior of Titans Tower at
                  night. As an alarm clock's ticking is heard, the sky pivots about the
                  center of the horizon; the dark panorama rotates out of view and is replaced by the
                  morning sun against wild blue yonder. The alarm begins to ring, and the camera cuts
                  to
                  an extreme close-up of the sleeping <span class="char">Starfire</span>'s closed eyes. She opens them
                  with a gasp, then squeezes them shut excitedly on the next line.) </i>
               
               
               <p><span class="starfire">Starfire: </span>The day has arrived!</p>
               
               <i> (She looks off to one side; cut to the source of the ringing, an alarm clock shaped
                  like
                  <span class="char">the Amazing Mumbo</span> that sits on her dresser. She reaches into view to shut it off, and we
                  see a close-up of a drawer, which she opens to reveal a pile of toys and party favors.
                  She sweeps up the lot and giggles o.c.; outside in the hall, her door opens and she
                  peeks cautiously back and forth. More bubbly little laughs escape her as she zips
                  out
                  and starts to ease toward the corner, whisking from one wall to the other as she goes.
                  Her armload jingles slightly. One item falls away when she ducks around the bend and
                  out
                  of sight, but she reaches back to pick it up.) </i>
               
               <i> (Now she makes her way past the stairs. Cut to inside a closed door; it slides open
                  to
                  admit her, and she lowers her goodies to expose her beaming face. Hearts float up
                  around
                  it.) </i>

                  <span class="char">Beast Boy</span> and <span class="char">Cyborg</span> are playing GameStation-the racing
                  game seen in "Sisters." A thundering hip-hop track drowns out all other sound at this
                  point. Close-up of <span class="char">Robin</span>, whose hair is being blown back by the wall of
                  sound, then of <span class="char">Cyborg</span> and <span class="char">Beast Boy</span>. They are having a

               <i> (Sight gag: roses bloom all around her head as she says this. When she finishes, she
                  grins broadly for several seconds-and then the flowers fall away, to the sound of
                  a
                  mental car wreck, as she realizes that no one is paying the least attention.
                  Disgruntled, she looks around the place and drops the items she has carried in, except
                  for a few strands of jingling bells that hang from her wrists. <span class="char">Cyborg</span> leans
                  into view, still struggling with the o.c. <span class="char">Beast Boy</span>, and she turns

                  zips
                  after him. A few seconds later, there is yell and a camera-shaking crash from the
                  two
                  boys' direction, and <span class="char">Beast Boy</span> hops into view as a frog, with the
