               <i> (Opening shot: a leather-bound book whose front cover displays the Titans' insignia. As the camera zooms in, it opens to the first page; a drawing of Earth, seen from outer space, and a kindly male voice begins to narrate.) </i>
               
               
               <p><b>Narrator: </b> Long ago, on a small blue planet called Earth...</p>
               
               <i> (Page turn: now a flying-saucer cutout floats against the cosmos, with <span class="char">Starfire</span> grinning and flashing a peace sign inside. On the next line, pan to follow it to
                  Titans Tower.) </i>
               
               
               <p><b>Narrator: </b> ...there was a young alien girl who lived in a T.</p>
               
               <i> (She beams and points to it as he finishes. Page turn: she smiles at the camera.) </i>
               
               
               <p><b>Narrator: </b> She had many friends.</p>
               
               <i> (The other four Titans pop up around her, causing that smile to widen even more. Page
                  turn: she strains to keep a flaming meteor from crushing Jump City.) </i>
               
               
               <p><b>Narrator: </b> She was very powerful...</p>
               
               <i> (Page turn: she holds a pair of smelly magenta boxer shorts at arm's length over the
                  washing machine while <span class="char">Robin</span>, <span class="char">Raven</span>, and <span class="char">Cyborg</span> keep their distance. The underwear is decorated with various animals; straight from
                  <span class="char">Beast Boy</span>'s wardrobe, and a small panel floats up the screen. He is within it, wearing only
                  a towel and shower cap and laughing his head off.) </i>
               
               
               <p><b>Narrator: </b> ...and very brave. And although she never thought much of it...</p>
               
               <i> (Page turn; we see her twirling feet, and she floats gently down in the soft light.) </i>
               
               
               <p><b>Narrator: </b> ...she was also very beautiful. Her life seemed entirely perfect...until one day.</p>
               
               <i> (A large bump pops out on her forehead; she gasps as the light returns to normal. This
                  gives way to a hysterical scream, and the view snaps to black.) </i>

               <i> (Opening shot: the exterior of the Tower, zooming in slowly. It is daytime. Cut to a close-up of <span class="char">Starfire</span>'s forehead; she is in the bathroom, and the glints show that she is looking in the
                  mirror.) </i>
               
               
               <p><span class="starfire">Starfire: </span> Huh?</p>
               
               <i> (A tentative poke at the bump makes it shiver slightly, as if it were filled with very
                  cold pudding. She leans closer, pressing it against the glass, and moans worriedly;
                  this is followed by a slow slide down the mirror and a little whine. Pull back to
                  frame all of her. She pushes down on the growth and succeeds in flattening it. However,
                  a relieved sigh is barely out of her mouth before it crops up again. Now, each time
                  she tries to mash it down, it simply appears in another spot beneath her hairline.
                  A few frantic prods put the thing out of sight, but only for a moment, as it comes
                  right back to the center of her forehead.) </i>
               
               <i> (<span class="char">Starfire</span> groans in frustration and pokes furiously at the protuberance, which shifts all over
                  her head as fast as she can get her finger after it, and finally jams down the spot
                  where it first cropped up. Now it has gone; a knock at the door draws her attention,
                  and it swells forth and draws another groan from her. In the hall, <span class="char">Beast Boy</span> is outside the bathroom, whining and doing the classic dance favored by little kids
                  with full bladders.) </i>
               
               
               <p><span class="beastBoy">Beast Boy: </span> <span class="char">Starfire</span>, hurry up! You've been in there for twenty minutes, and I'm not paper-trained</p>
               
               <i> (More whining, now doglike.) </i>
               
               
               <p><span class="starfire">Starfire: </span> <i> (from inside, through the door) </i> One moment more, please!</p>
               
               <i> (He hops slowly toward the door, which opens when he is just short of the threshold.
                  <span class="char">Starfire</span> peeks out, showing her forehead back under control, but the bump asserts itself anew
                  and she ducks back in, slamming the door. <span class="char">Beast Boy</span> rushes, but an instant too late; he slams into it face first and tumbles backward,
                  stopping himself from hitting the floor with a leg bent backward under his body.) </i>
               
               <i> (He staggers up and claps both hands over himself to hold it in, but the sound of flowing
                  water draws his attention elsewhere. Quick pan to <span class="char">Robin</span> outside; he is wearing an apron decorated with a potted plant and whistling happily
                  as he plays a hose over some bushes. Cut to a close-up of the groaning, sweating green
                  face, then pan quickly to a glass being held under a running faucet by <span class="char">Cyborg</span>. He leans into view, showing a hot, sweaty face with a towel draped around the neck;
                  that drink will come in handy indeed. Close-up of <span class="char">Beast Boy</span>, whose eyebrows twitch uncontrollably now as perspiration gushes from every pore,
                  then pan quickly to <span class="char">Raven</span> outside. She levitates two large boulders while floating in midair; pull back to
                  show the scene as a dry waterfall. Once the rocks are out of the way, a torrent gushes
                  over the precipice below her.) </i>
               
               <i> (Quick pan back to <span class="char">Beast Boy</span>, who looks and sounds as if he is about to explode. He starts to look around the
                  hall.) </i>

               <i> (Dissolve to a close-up of water swirling down a drain, accompanied by a toilet flush;
                  one way or another, he has finally found relief.) </i>

               <i> (She shudders a bit and prepares to lift the headgear; cut to behind her as she gets
                  it off. The sound of her new growth popping out is heard, but <span class="char">Raven</span> just stays deadpan.) </i>
               
               
               <p><span class="raven">Raven: </span> It's a zit. Everybody gets them. Deal with it.</p>

               <i> (The door opens to admit <span class="char">Robin</span>; she gasps in shock, a fresh sweat drop rolling down, then jams the hat back onto
                  her head and pulls it down to cover the top half of her face. He just crosses the
                  room to go about his business.) </i>
               
               
               <p><span class="raven">Raven: </span> Just so you know, that's not really dealing with it.</p>
               
               <i> (She walks o.c., leaving <span class="char">Starfire</span> to watch the blue-cloaked back. Zoom in slowly as she turns a very worried expression
                  to the camera.) </i>
               
               
               <p><b>Narrator: </b> But one little bump was only the beginning of her worries.</p>
               
               <i> (Dissolve to a close-up of her midsection and pull back slowly. She floats in a black
                  space, slowly rotating with arms spread wide, as question marks blink behind her.) </i>
               
               
               <p><b>Narrator: </b> Deep down inside, something strange was happening; something very strange indeed.</p>
               
               <i> (Dissolve to behind the couch. <span class="char">Starfire</span> sits in the center, flanked by <span class="char">Robin</span> and <span class="char">Cyborg</span>; a GameStation race is in progress on the window/screen. Close-up of the three; the
                  controllers are in the two boys' hands, while she huddles under her big green chapeau.) </i>
               
               
               <p><b>Narrator: </b> The next day, she grew tusks on her neck.</p>
               
               <i> (They pop out, one protruding from each side, and she gasps and tries to pull her head
                  down into her neck piece. A short squeal, two palms pressed to cover the new growths,
                  and a lightning-fast dive over the couch, but <span class="char">Robin</span> and <span class="char">Cyborg</span> are so engrossed in their game that they take no notice whatsoever. She puts her
                  eyes up over the cushions; now they give their thumbs a rest and glance her way, but
                  she ducks back out of sight. The two racers trade a puzzled look, shrug, and throw
                  crazed grins at the camera as they return to the game.) </i>
               
               <i> (Dissolve to a close-up of a belly-busting ice cream sundae in the kitchen, so tall that its top is cut off by the top edge of the screen. <span class="char">Beast Boy</span> leans into view, hearts in his eyes and drool oozing from the corner of his mouth.) </i>

                  care, and the camera pulls back to show him and <span class="char">Starfire</span> regarding the creation from opposite sides of the counter. She has put on a wide
                  scarf to hide her neck. He turns around to rummage in the cabinets; she leans eagerly
                  toward the sundae.) </i>
               
               
               <p><b>Narrator: </b> The day after that.. <i> (She gasps and jerks her hands from the counter; they are shaking.) </i> ...her fingernails grew long and ugly.</p>
               
               <i> (Close-up of those hands, dissolving to a shot that shows long striped nails and badly
                  swollen fingers. Pull back; she runs a panicked eye over the digits and hastily shoves
                  them into the sundae with a gasp. Towering scoops, chocolate syrup, and sprinkles
                  splatter in a heap on the counter. When <span class="char">Beast Boy</span> stands up from the cabinets, holding spoons for himself and <span class="char">Starfire</span>, he goggles at the destruction of his masterpiece, screams, and faints. Snap to black.) </i>
               
               <i> (The view resolves to the interior of the refrigerator as she opens the door to inspect
                  the moldy leftovers. Now she has added blue oven mitts to her ensemble.) </i>
               
               
               <p><b>Narrator: </b> And the day after that, she developed bizarre cravings for the most unusual foods.</p>

                  <span class="char">Starfire</span> whips out one padded hand and seizes it. What she does next is to turn her palm over
                  and peer carefully at it; close-up of the half-crushed fly, zooming in.) </i>
               
               
               <p><b>Fly: </b> Help me!</p>
               
               <i> (Pull back. The young Tamaranean lashes out her tongue, which is now considerably longer
                  than it has any right to be, and lays it squarely across the insect. Whisking it into
                  her mouth, <span class="char">Starfire</span> crunches down and swallows; a little hiccup comes back up after the meal, and she
                  claps a hand to her lips. The closing fridge door blacks out the screen.) </i>
               
               <i> (Snap to the exterior of the Tower. After the passage of all this time, it is day again.) </i>

               <p><b>Narrator: </b> ...the strange little alien grew stranger...</p>
