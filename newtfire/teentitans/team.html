               <div class="textContain" id="Shan"><p><b>Shannon Dunn</b> is an undergraduate English Literature major at the University of Pittsburgh at Greensburg, and is also pursuing the <a href="https://www.greensburg.pitt.edu/academics/majors-minors/digital-studies">Digital Studies Certificate</a>. She was drawn to this project solely because she binge-watched the entire series of Teen Titans before she came to school her freshman year, and thought it to be fate. Now a sophomore, she is already a member of the <a href="http://www.pitt.edu/~upgstd/">Alpha Alpha Delta Chapter</a> of <a href="http://www.pitt.edu/~upgstd/">Sigma Tau Delta</a>, the International English Honor Society, and does the social media for the university's <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Pitt-Greensburg-Gender-and-Sexuality-Alliance-GSA-221990461189688/">Gender and Sexuality Alliance</a>. She spends the sweet, sweet moments of free time she gets by hanging out with friends, writing, watching The Golden Girls (or Frasier), or going to concerts. Shannon hopes that you love the site and also have a beautiful rest of your day!</p></div>
            <div class="textContain" id="Lauren"><p><b>Lauren McNeill</b> is an undergraduate Engineering major at the University of Pittsburgh at Greensburg. She plans to double major with Film Studies by transferring to the University of Pittsburgh in the Fall of 2020. She's the project leader of Teen Titans and created the idea based on seeing a sticker from her friend's laptop of Teen Titans. Most of her designs are kind of hard to implement in real life, so it was nice to see this one come to life. She's also a sophomore and the Costume Co-coordinator/Costume Assistant for the university's theater. She's a part of Delta Psi Omega, the Theatre Honor Society.</p></div>
               <div class="textContain" id="Amber"><p><b>Amber Peddicord</b> is an undergraduate English Literature and Communication major at the University of Pittsburgh at Greensburg, where she is also pursuing a <a href="https://www.greensburg.pitt.edu/academics/majors-minors/digital-studies">Digital Studies Certificate</a>. She is joining the Teen Titans team in the project's second semester, as part of the <a href="https://newtfire.org/courses/dh/CDVSyll.html">Coding and Data Visualization</a> course at UPG, though she spent the Fall 2019 semester secretly geeking over the project from afar. When not working on this project, Amber worked as a Green Scholar research assistant for Dr. Elisa Beshero-Bondar on the <a href="https://digitalmitford.org/">Digital Mitford Project</a>. She is also Secretary of the Alpha Alpha Delta Chapter of Sigma Tau Delta. When not working on <em>any</em> of these projects, she spends her time reading, listening to music, and watching various reality competition shows on Netflix.</p></div>
