            <p>Thinking there's a bomb, Koriand'r and Raven go to a baseball game to find it and
               stop it; however, it's a ploy by the villian to kill them. He first tries to shoot
               Raven from a distance, but she senses it first and dodges it. Raven finds the location,
               third base, and Koriand'r rushes the bomb into space for the impending explosion.
               She throws it a bit too late and goes into shock due to the explosion. Raven, as an
               empath, can help her by taking her pain.</p>
