               her powers on Raven to make her see her worst fear, Trigon. Speedy is useless in the
               fight. Fran runs in right on time to Raven trying to kill Kid Flash who is Trigon
               in her mind. Worried she might stop their plan, Plasmus attacks her. However a turn
               of events occurs; Plasmus is taken down by an arrow and Fran takes down Phobia, freeing
               Raven. Now freed, Kid Flash is now afraid of the person Raven is. In anger, he shouts
               for her to leave.</p>
