                  and resolves into a red microchip rotating slowly in the light. Pull back a bit and
                  pan to one side to show darkness beyond this spot. A large figure stands up into
                  view; it is clad in black armor, with additional steel plating to reinforce key
                  areas, and wears a mask that hides the entire face. This is black, with a red-orange
                  circle in the center whose edges touch both eyes. The figure reaches toward the
                  chip, revealing a steel-gloved hand, and cocks one eyebrow in surprise. Cut to the
                  other side of the suspension field.<span class="char">Robin</span>is hanging upside down.) </i>

                  to a longer shot, pulling back to put the rest of the Titans in frame as well. The
                  place is a chamber stuffed with supercomputers. A laser beam lances down from above,
                  forcing<span class="char">Robin</span>to jump out of its way; cut to the ceiling, where a section is being
                  cut away from above. The piece falls in a cloud of dust, and several more intruders

                  the new arrivals coming right for him. He blocks or dodges several blows, then tries
                  a counter-kick that is deflected. The masked figure whips out a blaster, something
                  like a set of brass knuckles with a muzzle on the front edge, and opens fire. A few
                  acrobatic tricks carry<span class="char">Robin</span>out of danger; he retaliates with a jumping roundhouse
                  kick that sends the attacker crashing into the far wall.) </i>
               
               <i> (<span class="char">Starfire</span> just above, backs quickly across the screen to evade the shots from a
                  squad member who jumps up after her. She gathers herself and puts a starbolt right
                  where it belongs; her attacker is sent skidding across the floor. The next one jumps
                  even higher, up to the level of the large ceiling-mounted spotlights that illuminate
                  the place, and blasts at her. The lens of one light is struck and begins to fall
                  loose; she is directly underneath and about to be crushed, but<span class="char">Robin</span>leaps across
                  and plows her away just in time. The lens crashes to the ground.) </i>

                  <span class="char">Starfire</span> down. She is a bit dazed, but soon snaps to with a gasp.) </i>

                  shoot, a computer cabinet slides across and bulldozes them. Loud crash from o.c.
                  after it has passed; pan quickly in the opposite direction to<span class="char">Cyborg</span>, who is wiping
                  his hands; he pushed it at them.) </i>

                  just ahead of a laser beam. Another one is fired from midair; she creates a shield
                  around herself, and both it and the beam disintegrate when they make contact. The
                  enemy runs toward her and starts throwing punches, which she stops by forming small
                  barriers in front of herself as she slowly backs up. A low kick cuts her legs out
                  from under her; the blaster is aimed at point-blank range, but before it can be
                  fired, <span class="char">Beast Boy</span> as a bighorn sheep, rams its wielder into the wall. Cut to <span class="char">Raven</span>
                  standing and staring in genuine surprise, then to Beast Boy in human form. The
                  knocked-out commando lies crumpled in a heap.) </i>

                  ready to let him have it. As he finally turns to look, too late to save himself, two
                  computers slide into view from opposite directions under <span class="char">Raven's</span> control and crush
                  the would-be shooter between them.<span class="char">Beast Boy</span> yells in fright and throws up his arms
                  to protect himself; the hardware falls away and so does the smashed figure.<span class="char">Raven</span>
                  winds down her powers and gives<span class="char">Beast Boy</span> a hard stare, and a big drop of sweat
                  appears on his temple.) </i>

                  cannon, he starts to blaze away and soon has help in the form of <span class="char">Starfire's</span>
                  fusillade. One of the thieves leaps impossibly high to avoid the blasts, then pushes
                  off from the wall and sails straight toward the chip. A flying grab snares the
                  bounty, and those steel-booted feet are racing for the door.<span class="char">Robin</span>gives chase and
                  hurls his birdarang; it hits the thief's hand and knocks the chip away. Cut to<span class="char">Raven</span>

                  stop at the wall. An attacker's boot comes down on that tongue, which lets go of the
                  chip so it can be seized. This one vaults across the room to the door, where the
                  other survivors, four in all, have gathered, and throws down a smoke bomb. The
                  resulting gray clouds cover the screen and clear to reveal that the five have
                  escaped under cover of that diversion. Pull back to put<span class="char">Beast Boy</span> in frame; he is
                  back in human form and thoroughly dazed by what has just happened. Sight gag: a tear
                  of pain, in the shape of a clock pendulum, hangs from his eye and swings back and

                  leads here from the hatch, and drops into the water. One of the thieves is making

                  blaster. Cut to outside, near a mountainside at sunset. The beam emerges from within
                  and traces out a door-shaped outline, and the piece falls away; the sewers run
                  through the mountain. At the edge of the opening stands the thief, alone for only
