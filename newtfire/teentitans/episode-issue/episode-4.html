               <i> (Opening shot: a night sky filled with dark thunderhead clouds. Flashes of lightning
                  illuminate their contours. A bulky silhouette stands up among them and begins to
                  swing a pair of sticks against the clouds; every time it brings them down, there is
                  another strike and accompanying thunderclap. Dissolve to another patch of the sky,
                  where even more lightning crackles back and forth. A second silhouette, this one
                  much thinner and with spiky upswetpt hair, stands up and directs its hands here and
                  there. There is a new flare-up every time it does so.) </i>
               
               <i> (When the last one clears, the camera has moved to a point near the underside of the
                  clouds as the flashes continue from within. There is a huge strike, and the camera
                  pulls back to put Titans Tower in view. Inside, in the hall, <span class="char">Beast Boy</span> has become a
                  buffalo and is straining mightily at a rubber band looped over his horns, trying to
                  catch it on a nearby hook. He succeeds and ducks away, coming up in human form with
                  a mischievous smile on his face. Now he produces a large, filled water balloon that
                  sloshes a bit in his hands, and he lets off a wicked little chuckle.) </i>

                  tries desperately to make a safe catch. Finally, he gets hold of it and turns
                  around, and the camera pans to show <span class="char">Raven</span> behind him.) </i>

                  towel, shower cap, and slippers, standing there while the other <span class="char">SD Titans</span> scroll
                  past and laugh at him. The balloon disappears as he finishes; now a pull string
                  hangs down from the ceiling, and he reaches for it.) </i>

                  blueprint that fills most of the screen; the words "<span class="char">Beast Boy</span>" and "Insta-Lube"
                  slide in beneath it, after which "9000" drops from the lower edge and replaces them.
                  The diagram shows the rubber band, which is part of a floor-mounted slingshot, held
                  back by the hook and with the balloon loaded in. A tripwire in front of the rig runs
                  through overhead pulleys and is tied to a lever that is in turn connected to the
                  hook.) </i>

                  tripwire, and on the blueprint, a rough figure of <span class="char">Cyborg</span> steps up and catches his
                  foot there.) </i>
