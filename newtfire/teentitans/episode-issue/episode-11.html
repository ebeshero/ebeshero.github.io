               <i> (Opening shot: a litter of auto parts and tools on a garage floor. The sound of
                  mechanical work is heard from o.c., and the camera pans across the jumble and cuts
                  to each of the following in turn. First, a bit of spot welding is carried out. Sheet
                  metal is cut to make a body panel, after which a shock absorber is set in place and
                  a hubcap is bolted on. Next, a taillight is installed; in this shot, we see <span class="char">Cyborg</span>'s
                  hand holding the part; he is the one putting this vehicle together. An engine is
                  lowered toward the camera on an overhead crane, blacking out the screen when it is
                  close enough. From here, snap to a close-up of it in place; <span class="char">Cyborg</span> reaches into view
                  and torques a couple of bolts. Extreme close-up of the open hood, which he closes
                  before smiling and removing a rag from his shoulder to wipe his forehead.) </i>
               
               <i> (<span class="char">Cyborg</span> climbs into the driver's seat and presses a button on the dashboard. No
                  response.) </i>

                  balloon appears over his head, with assorted components scrolling by as if on a
                  stock ticker. After a few seconds, they are replaced by a glowing light bulb. <span class="char">Cyborg</span>
                  straightens up as the balloon evaporates, he has hit on something.) </i>

                  removes this and slips it into a slot on the dash. Rubbing his hands gleefully, he
                  tries the starter button again. This time, the engine sputters as he grimaces
                  nervously, and then it roars in full voice and brings an enormous smile to his
                  face.) </i>
               
               <i> (Dissolve to him standing by the vehicle, which is now covered with a tarp. His
                  garage doubles as the storage area of Titans Tower seen in "Final Exam" and
