                  close-up, they are seen as<span class="char">Cyborg</span><span class="char">Starfire</span> and<span class="char">Robin</span> and the vehicle is an
                  armored car whose back doors have been broken open. Gold bullion spills out to
                  the pavement. The bearded, helmeted male figure perched on it is clad in a
                  skintight black outfit with a light bulb on the chest, and both hands glow very
                  brightly. This is<span class="char">Doctor Light</span> not to be confused with the character of the
                  same name from the Mega Man game series.) </i>

            <p>Arella is the one who helped Raven escape. Trigon sends demons to find her, destroying
               anything and anyone who stands in the way. Raven, who can't take the suffering, surrenders
               to Trigon. Arella strikes Trigon in an attempt to let Raven get away, but Trigon stops
               Raven. Arella supresses Trigon long enough for Raven to get away.

            <p>The Titans are urgently trying to escape when they run into his dog, Fang; they leave
               Beast Boy to deal with him. Their plan is to combine their powers in order to send
               Trigon to the Netherverse. It works, but at the last minute, Arella jumps in after
               Trigon before the portal explodes. Raven reveals that in order to keep Trigon from
               escaping, someone had to block his path and that person was Arella.
