               <i> (Opening shot: a pure white field, which resolves into Robin's eye as the camera
                  pulls back to frame him running flat out. Pull back again; he is chasing <span class="char">Slade</span>
                  across a rocky landscape under the starry night sky. Pan across the area as the
                  masked villain leaps across a deep crevasse, then to a rock formation that
                  completely blocks the view. When the camera passes the far edge, it has moved to a
                  close-up of the two runners. With <span class="char">Robin</span> still close behind him, <span class="char">Slade</span> bounds over
                  another fissure and drops over the edge of a mesa before making a beeline for a
                  high, flat peninsula studded with several tower-like formations. There is a narrow
                  path leading to it, but he forgoes this in favor of a single long, high jump. <span class="char">Robin</span>
                  does likewise, landing in a crouch, and comes up for a wary look around. <span class="char">Slade</span> steps
                  out from behind a rock.) </i>
               
               
               <p><b>Slade: </b>Dangerous behavior, <span class="char">Robin</span>. You must be very eager to
                  see me. I'm flattered.
               </p>

                  <i> (stepping closer; they circle) </i>Hmm. But how can you stop me, when you don't
                  even know what I'm planning?

               </p>
               
               <i> (He rushes in with a savage kick; <span class="char">Slade</span> dodges easily, and the follow-up punch only
                  smashes a chunk from one of the towers. The two spare a bit, after which <span class="char">Robin</span> finds
                  himself on the defensive and tries a charging punch. <span class="char">Slade</span> catches his fist and
                  hurls him against a tower, but <span class="char">Robin</span> rebounds quickly and tries a punch that
                  pulverizes more rock. One strike after another misses its mark but sends up clouds
                  of stone dust. <span class="char">Slade</span>'s eye glows briefly during this string of attacks; at the end
                  of it, he lands a powerful kick that staggers the Titan very badly. He is soon on
                  his feet and fighting back, but his punches are blocked and he takes one that bowls
                  him over again.) </i>
               
               <i> (When he gets up this time, he has a birdarang in each hand and lets them fly. <span class="char">Slade</span>
                  stands his ground, arms crossed in front of himself; there is a quick flash and
                  clang of metal on metal, and we see each weapon in turn smash into a tower. The
                  formations begin to crumble, and the camera pulls back to an overhead view to show
                  them all toppling in a cloud of dust that covers the entire area. Close-up; <span class="char">Robin</span>'s
                  silhouette appears within the haze, and he steps into the open to survey the place.
                  His eyes pop when he looks off to his right; the dust clears as he sidles off that
                  way.) </i>
               
               
               <p><b>Slade: </b>
                  <i> (from o.c.) </i>Excellent, <span class="char">Robin</span>.<i> (passing crumbled formations behind him) </i>
                  We appear to be evenly matched and equally ruthless.
               </p>
               
               <i> (Back to <span class="char">Robin</span>, now easing around within the dust, on the end of this.) </i>
               
               
               <p><b>Slade: </b>
                  <i> (off-screen) </i>Not surprising. You and I are so very much alike.
               </p>
               
               <i> (As he finishes this line, the dust clears to show him standing behind <span class="char">Robin</span>; the
                  latter whirls to face him.) </i>

               <i> (He throws an uppercut that connects squarely with the metal-covered jaw and sends
                  <span class="char">Slade</span> crashing to the ground.) </i>

               </p>
               
               <i> (He gestures off to one side; <span class="char">Robin</span> looks in that direction and sees the shattered
                  debris left from the brawl. The base of one smashed pinnacle is shaped like <span class="char">Cyborg</span>'s
                  head, and as the camera pans across the rest of the rubble, broken likenesses of the
                  other three <span class="char">Titans</span> are seen.) </i>

               <i> (He reaches toward the face. Cut to an empty patch of sky; the mask is flung up and
                  away, and the camera cuts to a close-up of him and zooms in. He is staring in
                  bug-eyed shock, and a shift to just behind him shows why the face behind that smooth
                  expanse of steel is his own. The duplicate laughs heartily in <span class="char">Slade</span>'s voice as the
                  camera dissolves to a long overhead shot of the ruined peninsula and pulls back
                  slowly.) </i>
               
               <i> (A flash of white, and we are in <span class="char">Robin</span>'s room. He is asleep at his worktable, but
                  sits bolt upright with a gasp of terror-the entire proceedings up to this point were
                  his very bad dream. His face runs with sweat as he tries to catch his breath. The
