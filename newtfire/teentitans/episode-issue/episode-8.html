               <i> (Opening shot: choppy waves roiling in a violent thunderstorm at night. Riding the
                  swells, a freighter sails into view toward the camera. Three crewmen struggle to
                  secure a tarp over a group of several dozen 55-gallon drums; two other such
                  collections have already been covered. The captain steers the steadiest course
                  possible under the circumstances as waves break on the bow and the wind threatens
                  to
                  pull the sheeting out of the men's hands. Close-up of the drums, showing them to be
                  marked with the universal symbol for radiation hazards. One tips over and rolls away
                  across the deck, but a booted foot comes down to stop it.) </i>

                  with glowing yellow eyes, and it lifts a long trident. Back to the deck, where the
                  men are still struggling to get the waste squared away. There is an explosion from
                  around the corner of the wheelhouse, followed by the walls and windows blowing out.
                  When the dust clears, we are inside the ruined structure; the captain is sprawled
                  on

                  gone. Now a few waves spill onto the port side, carrying the creature up with them.

                  starboard, where he immediately climbs onto the deck with an identical device.) </i>

                  to look toward the stern before seeing him repeating the performance there as well;
                  he glares back at them and leaps back into the water. Staggering and groaning, the
                  captain crosses the wheelhouse and looks out through the hole in its walls. After
                  <span class="char">Trident</span>submerges, the cables on his clampspull taut and start to drag the ship
                  down, stern first. Back to the deck.) </i>

                  rising higher and higher and finally slipping beneath the waves as a life raft
                  floats by, carrying the captain and crew. The last they see of their vessel is
                  <span class="char">Trident</span> perched triumphantly atop the prow. Close-up of his weapon's points as they
                  drop below the surface, then cut to the utterly flabbergasted seafarers, trying to
                  figure out how they lost their ship and a huge consignment of radioactive leftovers
                  in one fell swoop. Pull back to a long shot of their rubber craft bobbing in the
                  maelstrom. A final lightning strike blacks out the screen when it recedes.) </i>

                  cockpits, and through the windows around them water is flowing by. The Titans are
