               <i> (Opening shot: a screenful of static, which resolves into a school crest. The field
                  is hexagonal, black-and-white checkered within a gold border. A large H is
                  superimposed on it in gold script; across the bottom is a white banner bearing the
                  letters "H.A.E.Y.P." Behind the crest, a square corridor can be seen, with yellow
                  walls, ceiling, and floor marked in a honeycomb pattern. A cool female voice begins
                  to narrate.) </i>
               
               
               <p><b>Narrator: </b>The H.I.V.E. Academy for Extraordinary Young
                  People is proud to introduce...
               </p>
               
               <i> (A platform rises into view in front of the crest, carrying three young individuals
                  on it to block the crest. One is a very short, bald boy in a jumpsuit; a pair of
                  goggles is propped on his forehead, and assorted controls are mounted at chest and
                  waist level. Behind him is a very tall, beefy fellow with collar-length brown hair
                  and a small beard. His sleeveless shirt and pants are black, and studded gold bands
                  cross his chest and run around his shoulders. Off to the right of these two, our
                  left, is a slim girl in an off-the-shoulder black dress trimmed with blue ruffles,
                  black-and-blue striped stockings, and black platform boots with blue soles. Her
                  lavender hair is bound into two large horn-like tufts that stick up above her ears,
                  her catlike eyes are the same color, and her skin is an odd shade of bluish-pink.
                  A
                  small pendant hangs from a black ribbon that encircles her throat.) </i>
               
               
               <p><b>Narrator: </b>...this year's top graduates.
               </p>
               
               <i> (They leap from the platform; the big one and the girl drop out of the frame, and the
                  camera zooms in on the runt. The big one's motion reveals studded gold
                  wristbands.) </i>
               
               
               <p><b>Narrator: </b>Gizmo, the boy genius whose intellect can
                  conquer any problem with an inventive solution.
               </p>
               
               <i> (During this line, cut to an extreme close-up of his chest control; he presses a
                  button, and the camera pulls back as a pair of large metal wings sprouts from his
                  back. He takes hold of the device at his waist, and the wings respond and carry him
                  into the air. Lasers pop out from the wall panels and open fire against him, but he
                  easily avoids all the shots and goes for another button. Now a small missile
                  launcher comes up between the wings and unleashes a salvo that destroys all the guns
                  with remarkable efficiency.) </i>
               
               <i> (Gizmo lands on the platform he and his classmates originally stood on, then glides
                  away as two large robots step in from portals that open up in the walls. The girl
                  takes his place.) </i>
               
               
               <p><b>Narrator: </b>Jinx, the enchanting sorceress whose powerful
                  hexes mean bad luck for her enemies.
               </p>
               
               <i> (During this line, she extends her arms to both sides and does a 360-degree twirl,
                  throwing off a wave of energy that causes a couple of wall panels to fall away. She
                  leaps high off the platform, and the panels crash down on the robots' heads. Two
                  others have moved in during this sequence and meet the same fate. She backflips down
                  the corridor a short dittance.) </i>
               
               <i> (Three large laser cannons emerge from recessed panels in the floor, but the giant
                  drops into view and bends its the barrel of one of them as if it were a piece of
                  taffy.) </i>
               
               
               <p><b>Narrator: </b>And Mammoth, the genetically enhanced giant
                  whose unstoppable strength speaks for itself.
               </p>
               
               <i> (During this line, he tears the cannon from its moorings and does an Olympic-style
                  hammer throw to sling it away. It skids across the floor and wrecks the other two.
                  Close-up of him, looking very pleased with himself; a robot looms up behind the
                  strongman and catches him in its huge hands. Gizmo jumps onto its back and attaches
                  a small unit. Close-up of this as it screws itself down, sending up a small puff of
                  smoke, then pull back. During the next line, Gizmo jumps free and sparks start to
                  fly from the head; he has hot-wired the thing to put it out of action.) </i>
               
               
               <p><b>Narrator: </b>Well-organized, highly trained, and
                  combat-equipped...
               </p>
               
               <i> (Mammoth throws off the robot, which collapses, and Gizmo lands in a crouch near the
                  camera before running off again. As the narration continues, Jinx runs to Mammoth
                  and springs up just before reaching him; he catches one foot and boosts her into a
                  series of flips that carries her down the corridor.) </i>
               
               
               <p><b>Narrator: </b>...these new H.I.V.E. agents are the perfect
                  fighting force.
               </p>
               
               <i> (She pronounces the acronym like the word "hype." Batteries of lasers emerge from
                  behind the walls and cut loose against Jinx, who continues her gymnastic advance.
                  Not one shot hits her, but the positioning of the turrets on opposite walls results
                  in their blowing each other to bits by the time she has reached the end of the
                  gauntlet. She lands with her back to the camera, surveying her triumph, then turns
                  to face front.) </i>
               
               
               <p><b>Narrator: </b>And for the right price..<i> (Gizmo and Mammoth
                     slide up on either side; pull back slightly.) </i>...this ideal team can be
                  yours.
               </p>
               
               <i> (The image gives way to static, which resolves into the H.I.V.E. Academy's crest
                  against a dark field. A gray-haired woman steps into view; severe dark outfit with
                  a
                  hexagonal gold patch on one sleeve. This is the school's headmistress.) </i>
               
               
               <p><b>Headmistress: </b>Well, Mr. Slade?
               </p>
               
               <i> (Cut to just behind her. Slade's shadowy form stands behind a railing on a slightly
                  elevated platform across the area-the same industrial machine room seen in "Divide
                  and Conquer." Wisps of steam rise from the floor. This has been a sort of highlight
                  reel and sales pitch that was displayed on the monitor, and her words mark the first
                  time someone refers to Slade by name.) </i>
               
               
               <p><b>Slade: </b>Impressive. Truly. However, robots and obstacle
                  courses only prove so much.
               </p>
               
               <i> (Extreme close-up of his eye on the end of this, then pull back across the space to
                  give a good view of it for the first time. The monitor is one of several in a row,
                  and the platform on which the headmistress stands stops short of them in an
                  overhang. Slade's vantage point is at the other end. He leads her away from the
                  screen and deeper into the machinery; pan to follow.) </i>
               
               
               <p><b>Slade: </b>My plans demand operatives who can function in the
                  real world<i> (They step onto a catwalk.) </i>If your students are going to serve
                  me...
               </p>
               
               <i> (They reach a darkened area with two spotlights shining down from above. One pool of
                  light is occupied by the three graduates; she steps into the other while he sits in
                  the blackness.) </i>
               
               
               <p><b>Slade: </b>...they'll have to pass one final exam<i> (Extreme

               </p>
               
               <i> (The light on the trio goes out, and the headmistress bows before hers is
                  extinguished as well. Only the outline of Slade's figure and his eye are visible
                  now. The remaining light source is switched off to black out the screen.) </i>
