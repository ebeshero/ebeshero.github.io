            <h2>Course Description</h2>
            
            
            <p>In its age-old context, the term romance refers to narratives that explore the unfamiliar,
               the wonderful, strange, and otherworldly. Romance takes us beyond the apparent limits
               of “reality” as we know it from our “home” culture, and can return us back to familiar
               ground in a way that helps us to perceive the world in a new way. Such narratives
               are the focus of this course. Our readings include centuries-old poetry and prose
               in translation from Europe and the Middle East, as well as twentieth-century and contemporary
               literature in the “fantasy” genre that draw upon centuries-old resources to build
               alternate realities for readers in our time. Our texts will show how ancient mythologies
               transform and take on new dimensions as they are shared and translated across cultures
               over centuries.
            </p>
            
            <p>We will study how fantasy literature in our time builds on a worldly literary heritage
               to develop complex multicultural and pointedly unreal realms shared between writers
               and readers. We will consider how Faerie lands and alternate worlds develop with precise
               rules of their own to give believable life to the bizarre, the magical, the supernatural.
               In fantasy’s escapes from the familiar we may recognize our powerful abilities to
               invent new realities, made real by sharing with communities through text, image, film,
               game, and wired network. Through our shared alternate realities of fantasy and romance,
               we may gain perspective on our fears of death and change as well as our desires to
               escape and travel out of ourselves.
            </p>

         <div id="grading">
            
            <h2>Grading:</h2>
            
            <p> Your grade will be based on Class Participation and In-Class Exercises (15%), Short
               Assignments (total: 25%), one Creative or Analytical Research Project (total: 20%),
               one Midterm Exam (total: 20%) and
               one Final Exam (20%). At least 90% of the work for the course must be completed in
               order to receive a passing grade (C or above).
            </p>
            
            
            <h3>Class Participation and In-Class Exercises: (15%)</h3>
            
            <p>This portion of your grade reflects the extent to which you attend class regularly
               and take an active role in class discussion, contributing thoughtful questions and
               observations based on the readings, as well as responding to my questions. It will
               also include your performance on any announced and unannounced quizzes and group exercises
               I may give in class. If you keep up with the readings listed on the schedule, and
               come to class each day prepared to discuss them, you will certainly do well with this
               component.
            </p>
            
            <p><strong>** Note:</strong> Your attendance is vital to this course and your achievement in it. You
               may miss three classes for any reason without penalty, but your participation
               grade will be reduced for additional unexcused absences. You’ll also be missing
               information and perspective on the readings that will almost certainly affect your
               performance on assignments and exams. If you miss class, try to keep in touch with
               other members of the class to find out what you’ve missed and consult with me to
               help you catch up and to be sure you understand the material. Please note that
               quizzes and in-class activities are time-sensitive and cannot be made up outside of
               the classes you
               missed.
            </p>
            
            
            
            <h3>Short Assignments: (25%)</h3>
            
            <p>Periodically throughout the semester, I will assign informal 2-3 page short response
               papers and/or other exercises, including exploring and writing about virtual environments
               based on literary texts. These exercises and short papers are designed to help you
               grapple with some challenging dimensions of our course readings, and should help you
               to strengthen your comprehension. They may also give you topic ideas for the major
               paper. Short papers should follow MLA formatting and citation guidelines (as needed).
               At the beginning or end of your paper, provide a relevant quote or two from the reading
               you’re discussing, a quote that helps to capture an idea you’re commenting on in your
               response.  Short writing assignments lose points for lateness.
            </p>
            
            
            
            <h3>Creative or Analytical Research Project: (20%)</h3>
            
            <p>One longer piece of writing, developed either as a paper or a digital project, applying
               fantasy criticism and theory, will be due in the second half of the course. Detailed
               project guidelines will be distributed in class. You will have an option to develop
               a fantasy narrative of your own working with (and reflecting on) materials from our
               course, or you may develop a research project investigating significant cultural,
               historical, or thematic issues in one or two of our course texts. This paper will
               be about 6-8 double-spaced pages, and must be your own, independent work (see the
               section on Academic Dishonesty below). Follow MLA formatting and citation guidelines.
               Note: Late projects will drop one grade notch (from B to B-) for each day late.
            </p>
            
            
            
            <h3>Midterm Exam: (20%) and Final Exam: (20%)</h3>
            
            <p>The exams may consist of essay questions, identifications of passages, and brief
               responses regarding significant events, terms, and concepts we have discussed in
               class. The Midterm will cover material from the first half of the course. The
               Final Exam, given during Finals Week, will have a comprehensive section, but will
               focus on material from the second half of the course. 
            </p>
            
            
            
            <h3>Grading Scale:</h3>
            
            <p>Grades are posted on Courseweb, and follow this standard scale: A: 93-100%, A-:
               90-92%, B+: 87-89%, B: 83-86%, B-: 80-82%, C+: 77-79%, C: 73-76%, C-: 70-72%, D+:
               67-69%, D: 60-66%, F: 59% and below. In taking the course on a S / NC (pass-fail)
               basis, students must earn a C to receive Satisfactory credit. G grades
               (incomplete) may be given only in conformity with the University of Pittsburgh at
               Greensburg’s Bulletin: <a href="http://www.bulletins.pitt.edu/greensburg/upg-academicpolicies.htm">http://www.bulletins.pitt.edu/greensburg/upg-academicpolicies.htm</a>.

            <h3>Classes and Readings:</h3>
            
            <p>This class is fast paced with very challenging reading. To do well in this course
               it is vital that you attend class regularly and keep up with the readings! <strong>Read all the material assigned before class on the day it is
                  scheduled</strong> so that you can discuss the material in class, raise questions
               about it, and intelligently respond to my questions and comments. <strong>Stay alert for any changes to the class schedule</strong>, which I will announce
               in class and online on Courseweb and e-mail. 
            </p>
            
            
            
            <h3>Classroom Courtesy:</h3>
            
            <p>Our class is fast paced, and requires that we all be making the best use we can of
               our in-person class sessions. Arriving late and leaving early disrupts the
               important collective mental activity of class. So does in-class texting and
               checking your cell phone. While class is in progress, talking disruptively,
               leaving the classroom, texting or using a cell phone or computer, reading a
               newspaper, or other distracting behavior will be actively discouraged, and will
               result in a deduction in your Participation grade. Please respect what we do in
               the classroom: attend class regularly, and come prepared to contribute your
               questions and ideas.
            </p>
            
            <p><strong>When an assignment is due,</strong> I expect that you will carefully
               edit and proofread your documents, and that you will turn in your assignments on
               time at the beginning of class or by the posted deadline for Courseweb
               assignments. If you need an extension, ask me courteously at least a day ahead of
               time. Do not ask for an extension on or after the day the paper is due.
            </p>
            
            
            
            <h3>Academic Dishonesty and Plagiarism:</h3>
            
            <p><strong>Plagiarism</strong> falsely represents another source’s words or ideas
               as your own, and, if you commit plagiarism in this course, you will receive a
               final course grade of F and be reported to the Vice President of Academic Affairs.
               Representing the voice of another individual as your own voice constitutes
               plagiarism, however generous that person may be in "helping" you with an
               assignment. <strong>To avoid plagiarism,</strong> cite your sources whenever you
               quote, paraphrase, or summarize material, or use digital images from any outside
               source (including websites, articles, books, course readings, Courseweb postings,
               or someone else’s notes). Turning in an assignment generated collectively under
               the name of a single individual is considered plagiarism. When instructed to
               collaborate on a project, project collaborators share collective authorship and
               should identify themselves directly as a team. When using the "copy" and "paste"
               features as you read and research, be sure that you are carefully marking that
               these passages are unprocessed from their source, so that you know to process it
               later. Forgetting to do so not only produces sloppy work but (whether you intended
               it or not) results in a false representation. As long as you make a good faith and
               clear effort to cite your sources, you will not be faulted for plagiarism, but
               your work will be penalized if citations are inaccurate, unclear, or lack
               important information. <strong>Cheating</strong> on exams or exercises will also
               receive a final course grade of F and be reported to the Vice President of
               Academic Affairs.

            <h3>E-mail Correspondence: </h3>
            
            <p>Send e-mail to me when you have questions or want to meet with me, but <strong>please identify yourself by name (first and last), and provide a
                  Subject Line</strong> when you do so. I prefer you <strong>do not submit
                  your papers to me by e-mail</strong>; see directions above for submitting
               assignments online. 
            </p>
            
            <p>Each student is issued a University email address (username@pitt.edu) upon
               admission. This email address may be used by the University for official
               communication with students. Students are expected to read email sent to this
               account on a regular basis. Failure to read and react to University
               communications in a timely manner does not absolve the student from knowing and
               complying with the content of the communications. The University provides an
               email forwarding service that allows students to read their email via other
               service providers (e.g., Hotmail, AOL, Yahoo). Students who choose to forward
               their email from their pitt.edu address to another address do so at their own
               risk. If email is lost as a result of forwarding, it does not absolve the
               student from responding to official communications sent to their University
               email address. To forward email sent to your University account, go to
               http://accounts.pitt.edu, log into your account, click on Edit Forwarding
               Addresses, and follow the instructions on the page. Be sure to log out of your
               account when you have finished. (For the full Email Communication Policy, go to
