								this recipe were one of, say, 100 other recipes you're keeping on
								file? Think about a good system for tagging the file for this

								with this and write a complete XML file in a way that makes sense to
								represent the recipe. (Think also about what matters here to
								represent the file, and what doesn't matter.) Submit the results on

							Banks's daily journal</a> or <a

								New Zealanders) from within the year 1769.</li>
							<li>longer than one or two sentences--at least a thick paragraph or
								two.</li>

						</ul>Copy and paste the text into the oXygen editor. Come up with a way that
						makes sense to "mark this up" in XML from the position of an archivist
						studying the Pacific voyages and cultural contact experiences. Your markup
						should: <ul>
							<li>Code <b>the structure</b> this text (its heading, its paragraphs,
								etc.)</li>
							<li>Mark passages with specific <b>cultural information</b> about
								people, places, and kinds of contact experiences that you can see
								here. Come up with a good system that makes sense to you for holding
								general and specific kinds of information. (Try marking in multiple
								layers: Do large passages show us trade experiences, and within them
								specific objects that are traded?)</li>
							<li>Contain XML elements <b>with some systematic use of attributes</b>,
								as in<br /> &lt;element
								attribute="value"&gt;tag&lt;/element&gt;</li>

									Drawing Tab </b>and highlight or circle or draw arrows to
									<b>mark these locations</b>. Insert a shape + <b>accompanying

							<li>Make a new slide in which you design <b>a summary chart of all the
									voyages discussed in this file</b>. On this slide, briefly

							<li>Choose a second journal entry by Banks or Cook from the year 1769

								coded in your first entry. As before, the entry you select must: a)
								feature some account of contact with Polynesians (Tahitians or New
								Zealanders) from the year 1769, and b) be longer than one or two
								setnences--at least a thick paragraph or two. </li>

							<li>Make a new XML file to contain TWO journal entries, and include the
								contents of your first entry together with the new one you chose. Or
								choose two new entries if you'd like to start afresh.</li>
							<li>Review our comments on your first homework exercise, and think
								carefully about a system for your coding of multiple entries
								together. As before, we ask that you code the journal's structure
								(including paragraph breaks, dates and other header information for
								each entry) as well as significant cultural details with an eye to
								marking related kinds of information for archival research. We ask
								that you: <ul>
									<li>Be sure your coding is consistent--that dates and paragraphs
										are all marked the same way consistently throughout your
										file, for example.</li>
									<li>For markup of cultural information or cultural contact
										events (like exchange of goods, thefts, rituals,
										communication, etc), be sure that you use some elements more
										than once, and that these are used across both entries.</li>
									<li>Be sure that you're defining elements and attributes in a
										way useful for cataloging and research--moving from the
										general to the more specific, and without unduly repeating
										the language of the journal entry in your tag names. (For
										advice on this, work with our comments in the homework we
										returned.)</li>

				<li>Download and install the following software on your home computer: <ul>
						<li><strong>All users:</strong>
							<a href="http://www.oxygenxml.com">&lt;oXygen/&gt;</a>. The University
							has purchased a site license for this software, which is installed in
							all CSSD labs. The license also permits students enrolled in the course
							to install the software on their home computers (for course-related use
							only). The license key is available in the Announcements section of <a
								href="http://courseweb.pitt.edu">Courseweb</a>.</li>
						<li><strong>Windows users:</strong>
							<a href="http://winscp.net/eng/download.php">WinSCP 5.1.7</a>

							obtain free licenses at <a href="http://fetchsoftworks.com/fetch/free"
								>http://fetchsoftworks.com/fetch/free</a>)</li>
						<li><strong>Linux users:</strong> You probably don't need to install
							anything. But look at how your system handles secure file transfer
							(SFTP).</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Pitt provides all students with a free <q>cloud storage</q> account on <a
						href="http://pitt.box.com">http://pitt.box.com</a>, and you will need to use
					this account to manage your shared project files. If you have not already done
					so, log into <a href="http://my.pitt.edu">http://my.pitt.edu</a>, select <q>My
						resources</q> from the menu bar at the top, and then select <q>Box</q>.
					Access your account and familiarize yourself with how it works.</li>
				<li>During the first weeks of the semester, meet with the profs to configure and
					access your individual user account on our new Greensburg "sandbox" server.
					[More on this soon!) You will need this account for some of the course
					assignments.</li>
