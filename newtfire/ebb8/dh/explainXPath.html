  <section>    <h3 id="what">What is XPath and How Does It Work?</h3>
      			
      <p>Remember how we’ve described XML as like “nested boxes” or a “tree”? (Review that,
         if
         				you like, on our page explaining XML <a href="explainXML.html">“So What Exactly is
            					XML anyway?”</a>) Think of a whole XML file as a big box, and nested inside it
         				are smaller boxes. If we think of XML as a tree, we can consider the whole file
         as
         				springing from one root, and branching out in complex ways.
      </p>
      			
      <p><b>XPath</b> is a language that we write to select parts (or <b>nodes</b>) of an XML
         				document, so we can pick out the pieces, remix them, add to them, count them,
         number
         				them, etc. We write what’s called an <b>XPath expression</b> so a computer can
         				follow the path we lay out to to certain parts of an XML document. The way we
         				express this needs to be very precise, though often there are multiple ways of
         				creating a path or identifying a location in a document.
      </p>
      			
      <p>Though we sometimes “do XPath” for its own sake while we’re coding our
         				files, to help us find particular things, or check or count something, most often
         we
         				use XPath expressions within XML-transformation languages, including XQuery (XML
         				Query Language) and XSLT (eXtensible Stylesheet Language Transformations). XPath
         is
         				a “helper” or ancillary language that’s necessary to work with these transformation
         				languages, which allow us to remix, rewrite, extract pieces from, and add pieces
         to XML
         				files. Before you can write these transformations, you need to learn XPath. 
      </p>
      		</section>	
   <section>   <h3 id="node">XML is Made of Nodes</h3>
      			
      <p>Think of our nested boxes in XML as made of <b>nodes</b>. A <b>node</b> is a position
         				on the XML tree, and can be one of three things:
      </p>
      			
      <ol>
         				
         <li>an element (or the <b>element node</b>), which, remember, contains the start and
            					end tags and everything inside: from <span class="code">&lt;element&gt; . .
               						.contents . .&lt;/element&gt; .</span></li>
         				
         <li>an attribute (or the <b>attribute node</b>, which contains attributes and their
            					values inside tags, as in <span class="code">@item="beads"</span> in the element
            						<span class="code">&lt;trade item="beads"&gt;</span>. <br /> (Note, we’ll
            					use the <span class="code">@</span> symbol to indicate an attribute value from
            					now on.)
         </li>
         				
         <li>plain text (or the <b>text node</b>), which is only the text content within an
            					element. (We locate the text node in cases when we want to strip out elements
            					and preserve only the text.)
         </li>
         			
      </ol>
      			
      <p>This link provides a handy picture of how element nodes and text nodes fit together
         				in a "tree:" <a href="http://dh.obdurodon.org/introduction-xpath.xhtml#node">David

      <p>We’ve shown you the Outline View in &lt;oXygen/&gt;, and it may be helpful to look at
         				an outline of a file now, to explain how nodes relate to each other.

         <p>Element and text nodes are described in XPath like a big family of ancestors,
            					descendents, parents, children, and siblings. 
         </p>
         				
         <p>In the Outline view of this HTML file which we took from 
            						&lt;oXygen/&gt;, we’ve marked multiple levels of a family
            					relationship: The yellow squared root node <span class="code">&lt;html&gt;</span> is the original ancestor of all the descendents inside.
            					The red squared nodes (the <span class="code">&lt;head&gt;</span> and <span class="code">&lt;body&gt;</span> elements) are the immediate <b>children</b>
            					of the <span class="code">&lt;html&gt;</span> root node. They are also
            						<b>siblings</b> to each other. 
         </p>
         				
         <p>What’s the relationship of the <span class="code">&lt;b&gt;</span> node (squared off in pink) to the
            						<span class="code">&lt;body&gt;</span> node? It’s a grandchild, or a
            					descendant. And it’s the child of the <span class="code">&lt;p&gt;</span>
            					element. See how that works?
         </p>
         				
         <p>The elements I’ve squared off in blue may help us to visualize siblings, all the
            					children of <span class="code">&lt;body&gt;</span>. In XPath, we can distinguish
            					these siblings in relation to each other. The second element squared in blue,
            					the <span class="code">&lt;p&gt;</span> element with the text “XPath”, is the <b>"following-sibling"</b> to the <span class="code">&lt;p&gt;</span> element holding the text "Remember how we've described XML..."
            					And we can say that the <b>preceding-sibling</b> to the <span class="code">&lt;ol&gt;</span> element is the <span class="code">&lt;p&gt;</span>
            					element, which holds the text, “Think of our nested boxes in XML...” <br />

      <p>What we’ve just been describing about family relationships is closely connected to
         					<b>axes</b> in XPath. XPath’s default is to locate the <b>child</b> of the
         					<b>current context node</b> (or the current position designated in the XML
         				file). Basically, when you designate an axis in an XPath expression, you’re
         				indicating the direction you want your path expression to go: Do you want it to
         look
         					<b>up</b> to a parent or ancestor? Or <b>down</b> to a child or descendent? 
      </p>

If you think about this axis in terms of the nodes on the XML tree, ancestors of an element are NOT on the preceding axis, even though they begin before the current context! That is because the ancestor node <em>is still open around the current context node</em> while you are invoking it. The ancestor of the current context doesn't precede it because it is currently containing it.</td>

      <p>When we write path expressions, we indicate the axis, and we could indicate the name
         				of an element we’re searching for, or another node specifier like the text node
         or
         					<span class="code">text()</span>. There’s a longhand form for specifying axes,
         				and sometimes that longhand comes up in the XPath window in &lt;oXygen/&gt;, so it
         				can be handy to know what these are and what they mean. Use whatever form of these
         				makes the most sense to you as you’re writing your XPath expressions. 
      </p>
      		</section>	
      <section><h3 id="write">How to Write an XPath Expression</h3>
      			
      <p>So you want to start writing an XPath expression already! Here we go. <b>Use the
            					XPath 2.0 window</b> in the upper left of your &lt;oXygen/&gt; screen. An XPath
         				expression is a kind of journey, and it begins by figuring out where you are (what’s
         				your context node?) and taking a step along an axis direction. 
      </p>
      			
      <p>When we start writing XPath expressions, we usually begin from the root or “document
         				node” at the top of the tree, and many of our path expressions will begin with
         a
         				double slash: <span class="code">//</span>, which is shorthand for the descendant
         				axis: If we *start* our XPath expression with the double slash, we indicate we’re
         				beginning at the top-level document node and working our way down: 
      </p>
      			
      <p><span class="code">//body/div/p</span></p>
      			
      <p>This expression means, <b>start at the beginning node of the document</b> and <b>look
            					for the body element anywhere below</b>. Next, switch to the child axis, and
         					<b>take one step to find the immediate children of body--the div elements</b>
         				(however many there are). Then find <b>all p elements</b> that are the <b>immediate
            					children of all the div</b> elements.
      </p>
      			
      <p>What if we want to return all the elements at a particular level, regardless of what
         				they are? Here’s where we use the asterisk: <span class="code">*</span>.
         				Examples:
      </p>
      			
      <p>
         				<span class="code">//body/div/*</span>
         				<br />
         				<span class="code">//body/div//*</span>
         				<br /><br />
         				<span class="code">parent::*</span>
         				<br />
         				<span class="code">self::*</span>
         			
      </p>
      			
      <p>Notice how these work: We say, in the first one, start from the document (root) node,
         				and go down to find the body element, then all the <b>div</b> elements that are
         				children of <b>body</b>, and then please return all the elements that are the
         					<b>immediate children of div</b>. How’s the second one different from the first?
         				Notice that we take a longer step down with that <b>double slash</b>: This says,
         				with all those div elements that are children of body, please look down the
         				descendent axis and return all the elements that are either the children or the
         				descendents of div. <br /><br /> With the last two, notice we designate the axis
         				first. The <span class="code">parent::* </span> will return the name of the parent
         				element for the current context node, whatever it is. (“Who’s my mommy?“) The
         last
         				one I wrote for the sake of writing it: What if we were somehow lost in an XML
         file
         				and just wanted to return the name and location of the current context node: (“Where
         				am I??” or “Who am I?”) 
      </p>
      			
      <p>Now, a single slash, <span class="code">/</span>, typically indicates taking a step
         				in a path expression, and when it’s used by itself, it means, “take one step down
         				and find the immediate children of the context node.” When we’re writing XQuery
         and
         				XSLT we’ll find ourselves writing XPath expressions from specific points inside
         a
         				document (not necessarily from the root or document node up at the top), so in
         those
         				cases we might actually begin an expression like this: 
      </p>
      			
      <p><span class="code">p/span</span></p>
      			
      <p>This means, starting from the current context node, look for the immediate children
         				named <span class="code">p</span>, and then go down and find all the immediate
         				children of <span class="code">p</span> named <span class="code">span</span>.
      </p>
      			
      <p>So how do we work with attributes? They have their own <span class="code">@</span>
         				axis. Here are some examples of how you can access the attribute axis and what
         you
         				might find:
      </p>
      			
      <p><span class="code">//@id <br /><br /> //div/@id </span>
         			
      </p>
      			
      <p>The parents are attributes are technically elements, so very frequently we climb down
         				(or up) an axis to locate a parent element, and then shift over to the attribute
         				axis with the <span class="code">/@</span>, as we did in the second example here.
         				Notice with the first example, though, that this actually starts from the document
         				(root) node, and hunts through the whole document looking for all instances of
         the
         					<span class="code">@id</span> inside elements wherever it may turn up. If you
         				download this html file that you’re reading, open it in &lt;oXygen/&gt; and run that
         				XPath, click on the results in the bottom view window, and they’ll highlight just
         				the attribute portions of their elements. 
      </p>
      </section><section>			
      <h3 id="predicates">Predicates, the Filters of XPath: <span class="code">[ ]</span></h3>
      			
      <p><b>Predicates</b> in XPath are filtering tools. When we write these, we want to keep
         				in mind the structure of the document, and the direction that the computer processor
         				“looks” as it’s following your XPath expression. <a href="http://dh.obdurodon.org/introduction-xpath.xhtml#predicates">David
            					Birnbaum gives a good flowchart explanation of how this works on the
            					“Predicates” section of his XPath site</a>. When you write a predicate, you
         				indicate how to select a specific thing out of a lineup, a particular paragraph
         				based on its position, for example. You write a predicate using square brackets:
      </p>
      			
      <p>
         				<span class="code">//div/p[1]</span>
         				<br /><br />
         				<span class="code">//div[@id="space"]/p[1]</span>
         			
      </p>
      			
      <p>So, say we have multiple <span class="code">div</span> elements, each of which has
         				multiple <span class="code">p</span> children. The first expression returns, for
         				each div in turn, its <b>first</b>
         				<span class="code">p</span> child. In my document, I have two divs with p children,
         				so this XPath returns 2 results, the first paragraph only in each of these
         				divs.<br /><br /> The second is a little more complex: Can you work it out? Here we
         				use predicates in two steps of our XPath expression, to streamline results at
         each
         				level: First, we say, look for ONLY the div element with the @id="space". <b>We
            					filter out all of the other divs</b> which have different @id attribute values,
         				then, and we ONLY look inside this one div that has this distinguishing
         				characteristic. Then, we step down and find its first p child. Make sense? 
      </p>
      			
      <p>Now, you can actually set multiple predicates [][] right next to each other in an
         				XPath expression. Here’s an example of when you might need to do this: Say you
         have
         				a file divided up into multiple sections using <span class="code">div</span>
         				elements. Let’s say that several of these <span class="code">div</span> elements are
         				designated with <span class="code">@type</span>, as in <span class="code">&lt;div
            					type="poem"&gt;</span> to indicate a particular kind of content inside. You may
         				have other <span class="code">div</span> elements designated as <span class="code">@type="preface"</span> and <span class="code">@type="acknowledgments"</span>.
         				So this file is basically a “book” of poems with some accompanying material, and
         the
         					<span class="code">div</span> elements separate each poem from the others. Now,
         				let’s say you want to find your way with XPath to the <b>fifth</b> poem in the file.
         				Here’s how you’d do that by making two predicates side by side:
      </p>
      			
      <p><span class="code">//div[@type="poem"][5]</span></p>
      			
      <p>See how this works? First you say, find me the <span class="code">div</span> elements
         				filtered by <span class="code">@type="poem"</span>, and then filter those results to
         				give me just the <b>fifth</b> one in the sequence.

      <h3 id="functions">Functions, How to Do Things with XPath: <span class="code">( )</span>
         			
      </h3>
      			
      <p>Functions let us do some processing of the things we locate with XPath expressions.
         				What if you don’t want to return all the <span class="code">p</span> elements inside
         				a div, and you just want to <b>count</b> them all? That’s when we use a function
         				called <span class="code">count()</span>. You put in parentheses the nodes you want
         				to count, and this can work in lots of ways: 
      </p>
      			
      <p>
         				<span class="code">count(//@id)</span>
         				<br /><br />
         				<span class="code">//div/count(p)</span>
         				<br /><br />
         				<span class="code">count(//div/p)</span>
         				<br /><br />
         				<span class="code">//div[@id="space"]/count(p)</span>
         			
      </p>
      			
      <p> In the first of these, I’ve written an expression that says, "Count the number of
         				times the <span class="code">@id attribute</span> is used in this file, starting
         				from the root (document) node. (When I run it here in &lt;oXygen/&gt; as I’m writing
         				this document, the answer is 3 (as I see in the bottom window). <br /><br /> The
         				second expression, <span class="code">//div/count(p)</span>, says, start from the
         				root node, go down to ALL the div elements in the file, and then count the p
         				elements in EACH div, one by one. My bottom view screen in &lt;oXygen/&gt; gives me
         				a set of three results, with a count for each div in turn. That can be handy!
         				<br /><br /> But what if we want to find out how many p elements there are total
         				under ALL the divs? That’s what the third expression, <span class="code">count(//div/p)</span> does: It gives just ONE result, and it’s a count of ALL
         				the p elements in ALL the divs, without differentiating them div by div by div.
         				Let’s think about why this gives a different result from the previous example:
         This
         				has everything to do with where you place the count function! When you place the
         				count at the end, and don’t include the div element in the parentheses, you
         				effectively step down the tree to each div, and THEN do a count of the p elements
         				inside each. By contrast, when you say <span class="code">count(//div/p)</span>, the
         				computer postpones the counting until it’s found all the p’s everywhere that are
         				children of divs. The count function says, “Hey! round up ALL the p’s that are
         				children of divs, and count those.” <br /><br />Can you figure out what the last
         				expression is counting? <span class="code">//div[@id="space"]/count(p)</span>
         				<br /><br /> This combines a predicate with a function! So you indicate that you
         				want to start with only one <span class="code">div</span>, the one with the <span class="code">@id="space"</span> . Then you count
         					the number of <span class="code">p</span> elements in that <span class="code">div</span>. 
      </p>
      			
      <h3 id="combine">Using Functions and Predicates Together: Some Complex XPath!</h3>
      			
      <p>You can actually put functions inside predicates in XPath as a way to filter your
         				results! Here’s an example: Say we want to find any and all <span class="code">div</span> elements that
         				have <b>just one <span class="code">p</span> child</b>? We’d write that expression this way:
      </p>
      			
      <p><span class="code">//div[count(p) = 1]</span></p>
      			
      <p>Here’s another example. What if want to return an div element that doesn’t have ANY
         p
         				elements? Here we’d use a predicate again, and this time use a function called
         <span class="code">not()</span></p>
      			
      <p><span class="code">//div[not(p)]</span></p>
      			
      <p>About these examples: Notice that when you put a function in an XPath predicate, you
         				don’t have to indicate that you’re stepping down a tree to get the child element.
         				The default expectation when we don’t give an axis is that we’re stepping down
         to
         				the immediate child.
      </p>
      			
      <p>Quite often in writing XPath, we’re trying to find something in terms of its
         				position. We’ve given you examples of predicates that return a specific numerical
         				position, as in the first or fifth paragraph or div element, using [1] or [5].
         But
         				what if you don’t have an exact position, but know you want to return, say, the
         				first 10 of a particular element? Here’s where we can use the <span class="code">position()</span> function. <br /><br />
         				<span class="code">//div[@type="poem"][position() &lt; 10]</span>
         				<br /><br /> This retrieves the first 10 <span class="code">&lt;div
            					type="poem"&gt;</span> elements in an XML collection of poems chunked in divs.
         				The predicate expressions work to filter by grabbing all the appropriate “poem”
         divs
         				whose position is 10 or under. <b>Note that nothing goes inside the parentheses for
            						<span class="poem">position()</span>.</b> Context functions like this keep
         				the parentheses open. (Basically, <span class="code">position()</span> and <span class="code">last()</span> are written differently from the mathematical
         				functions like count(), where we indicate a particular thing to be counted inside
         				the parentheses.) 
      </p>
      			
      <p> Here’s another useful positional function: <span class="code">last()</span><br /><br /> As you might expect, <span class="code">last()</span>
         				returns the last of a thing you’ve designated. This is another positional function
         				frequently used in predicates. So, where <span class="code">//p[1]</span> returns
         				the first &lt;p&gt; element in the document, <span class="code">//p[last()]</span>
         				returns the last, wherever it is, and it’s handy because we usually don’t know
         how
         				many p elements (or paragraphs) there are in a big file! <b>Again, note that nothing
            					goes inside the parentheses for this positional function.</b></p>
      			
      <p>XPath has a little over 100 different functions to choose from, but in most project
         				scenarios, you really only need to work with a handful, which you’ll get to know
         				pretty well. (One of our favorites is <span class="code">distinct-values()</span>,
         				which we’ll show you. We use distinct-values to eliminate repetition in a list
         of
         				results, so we get only the distinctly <b>different</b> things, like the names of
         				elements we’ve used, for example. Don’t try to memorize these, but you’ll need
         to
         				look them up periodically and find one to use. Here are some useful XPath function
         				lists, with explanations of what the functions do and how they work:

   <section><h3 id="comparison">Testing for Comparisons with XPath</h3>
   	<p>We often write XPath predicates to find out where a <code>count()</code> of something is no higher than X number, or where an attribute value in one position (say <code>//sp[@who="#NelsonNell"]</code> is equal to a value in another position (say <code>//persName[@ref="#NelsonNell"]</code> in our XML documents. To express conditions of comparison, where one value compares a certain way with another value, we use <strong>comparison operators</strong>. XPath can express two types of comparison: <dfn>value comparison</dfn> and <dfn>general comparison</dfn>. We reproduce here Obdurodon’s explanation of value comparison and general comparison with examples of each. The next sections on value comparison and general comparison are quoted from the indispensable resource, <a href="http://dh.obdurodon.org/functions.xhtml">The Xpath functions we use the most</a>.</p>
   	<h4>Value comparison</h4>
   	<p>The value comparison operators are:</p>
   	<ul>
   		<li><strong>eq</strong> equal to</li>
   		<li><strong>ne</strong> not equal to</li>
   		<li><strong>gt</strong> greater than</li>
   		<li><strong>ge</strong> greater than or equal to (not less than)</li>
   		<li><strong>lt</strong> less than</li>
   		<li><strong>le</strong> less than or equal to (not greater than)</li>
   	</ul>
   	<p>Value comparison can be used only to compare exactly one item to exactly one other
   		item. For example, to create a predicate that will filter <code>&lt;sp&gt;</code>
   		elements to keep only those where the value of the associated <code>@who</code>
   		attribute is equal to the string <q>hamlet</q>, we can write:</p>
   	<pre>//sp[@who eq 'hamlet']</pre>
   	<p>Since each <code>&lt;sp&gt;</code> has exactly one <code>@who</code> attribute and
   		since we are comparing it to a single string, the test will return True or False for
   		each <code>&lt;sp&gt;</code> in the document. Because the <q>exactly one item</q>
   		can be an empty sequence (technically no items), the test will also work (and return
   		False) when an <code>&lt;sp&gt;</code> element has no <code>@who</code> attribute.
   		It is, however, an error if either side of the comparison contains a sequence of
   		more than one item.</p>
   	<p>Value comparison is often used for numerical values. To keep all of the speeches
   		(<code>&lt;sp></code> elements) with more than 8 line (<code>&lt;l></code>)
   		descendants, we can write:</p>
   	<pre>//sp[count(descendant::l) gt 8]</pre>
   	<p>In the preceding example, the output of the <code>count()</code> function is a single
   		item, an integer, and it is being compared to another single item, the integer value
   		8.</p>
   	<h4>General comparison</h4>
   	<p>The general comparison operators are:</p>
   	<ul>
   		<li><strong>=</strong> equal to</li>
   		<li><strong>!=</strong> not equal to</li>
   		<li><strong>&gt;</strong> greater than (may also be written
   			<strong>&amp;gt;</strong>)</li>
   		<li><strong>&gt;=</strong> greater than or equal to (not less than; may also be
   			written <strong>&amp;gt;=</strong>)</li>
   		<li><strong>&lt;</strong> less than (may also be written
   			<strong>&amp;lt;</strong>)</li>
   		<li><strong>&lt;=</strong> less than or equal to (not greater than; may also be
   			written <strong>&amp;lt;=</strong>)</li>
   	</ul>
   	<p>While value comparison operators can compare only one thing on the left to one thing
   		on the right, general comparison operators can have one or more items on either side
   		of the comparison (also zero items, since the empty sequence is also allowed). For
   		example:</p>
   	<pre>//sp[@who = ('hamlet', 'ophelia')]</pre>
   	<p>will retain all <code>&lt;sp&gt;</code> elements where the <code>@who</code>
   		attribute is equal to <em>either</em>
   		<q>hamlet</q> or <q>ophelia</q>. This makes general comparison a convenient
   		alternative to a complex predicate like:</p>
   	<pre>//sp[@who eq 'hamlet' or @who eq 'ophelia']</pre>
   	<p>In comparisons with exactly one item on either side of the comparison operator, value
   		comparison and general comparison are equivalent.</p>
   	<p>One possibly surprising feature of general comparison is the way it behaves with
   		negation. Consider:</p>
   	<div class="badCode">//sp[@who != ('hamlet', 'ophelia')]</div>
   	<p><em>This does not find all speeches by anyone other than Hamlet or Ophelia!</em> It
   		finds all speeches where the <code>@who</code> attribute is not equal to <em>any
   			one</em> of the individual items in the sequence on the right. This means that
   		it finds all speeches without exception, since the ones by Hamlet are not by Ophelia
   		(the test succeeds because <code>@who</code> is not equal to <q>ophelia</q> in
   		situations where it is equal to <q>hamlet</q>) and vice versa.</p>
   	<p>So how <em>do</em> you find all speeches by anyone other than Hamlet or Ophelia?
   		Try:</p>
   	<pre>//sp[not(@who = ('hamlet', 'ophelia'))]</pre>
   	<p>The preceding predicate says that we want to keep all speeches where it is not the
   		case that the <code>@who</code> attribute is equal to either <q>hamlet</q> or
   		<q>ophelia</q>.</p>
