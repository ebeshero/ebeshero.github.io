            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>The summits of the loftiest mountains were already illumined by
               the rays of the rising sun, the shades of night were fled, and all things
               plainly visible, when the queen and her company arose, and hied
               them first to the dewy mead, where for a while they walked: then,
               about half tierce, they wended their way to a little church that
               was hard by, where they heard Divine service; after which, they
               returned to the palace, and having breakfasted with gay and gladsome
               cheer, and sung and danced a while, were dismissed by the
               	queen, to rest them as to each might seem good. But when the sun
               was past the meridian, the queen mustered them again for their
               wonted pastime; and, all being seated by the fair fountain, thus, at
               her command, <span class="person">Neifile</span> began.

               	agreed to give Guasparruolo's wife, that he may lie
               	with her. He gives them to her, and in her presence
               	tells Guasparruolo that he has done so, and she

            <div class="frame">
               <p>Sith God has ordained that 'tis for me to take the lead to-day
                  with
                  my story, well pleased am I. And for that, loving ladies, much has
                  been said touching the tricks that women play men, I am minded to
                  tell you of one that a man played a woman, not because I would
                  censure what the man did, or say that 'twas not merited by the
                  woman, but rather to commend the man and censure the woman,
                  and to shew that men may beguile those that think to beguile them,
                  as well as be beguiled by those they think to beguile; for peradventure
                  what I am about to relate should in strictness of speech not be
                  termed beguilement, but rather retaliation; for, as it behoves woman
                  to be most strictly virtuous, and to guard her chastity as her very life,
                  nor on any account to allow herself to sully it, which notwithstanding,
                  'tis not possible by reason of our frailty that there should be as perfect
                  an observance of this law as were meet, I affirm, that she that allows
                  herself to infringe it for money merits the fire; whereas she that so
                  offends under the prepotent stress of Love will receive pardon from
                  any judge that knows how to temper justice with mercy: witness
                  what but the other day we heard from <span class="person">Filostrato</span> touching Madonna
                  Filippa at <span class="place">Prato</span>.Cf. Sixth Day, Novel VII.
               </p>
            </div>
            <p>Know, then, that there was once at <span class="place">Milan</span> a German mercenary,
               <span class="person">Gulfardo</span> by name, a doughty man, and very loyal to those with whom
               he took service; a quality most uncommon in Germans.
               And as he was wont to be most faithful in repaying whatever moneys
               he borrowed, he would have had no difficulty in finding a merchant
               to advance him any amount of money at a low rate of interest.
               Now, tarrying thus at <span class="place">Milan</span>, <span class="person">Gulfardo</span> fixed his affection on a very
               fine woman, named Madonna <span class="person">Ambruogia</span>, the wife of a wealthy
               merchant, one Guasparruolo Cagastraccio, with whom he was well
               acquainted and on friendly terms: which amour he managed with
               such discretion that neither the husband nor any one else wist aught
               of it. So one day he sent her a message, beseeching her of her
               courtesy to gratify his passion, and assuring her that he on his part
               was ready to obey her every behest.
            </p>
            <p>The lady made a great many words about the affair, the upshot
               of which was that she would do as <span class="person">Gulfardo</span> desired upon the following
               terms: to wit, that, in the first place, he should never discover
               the matter to a soul, and, secondly, that, as for some purpose or another
               she required two hundred florins of gold, he out of his abundance
               should supply her necessity; these conditions being satisfied she
               would be ever at his service. Offended by such base sordidness in
               one whom he had supposed to be an honourable woman, <span class="person">Gulfardo</span>
               passed from ardent love to something very like hatred, and cast about
               how he might flout her. So he sent her word that he would right
               gladly pleasure her in this and in any other matter that might be in
               his power; let her but say when he was to come to see her, and he
               would bring the moneys with him, and none should know of the
               matter except a comrade of his, in whom he placed much trust, and
               who was privy to all that he did. The lady, if she should not rather
               be called the punk, gleefully made answer that in the course of a few
               days her husband, Guasparruolo, was to go to <span class="place">Genoa</span> on business, and
               that, when he was gone, she would let <span class="person">Gulfardo</span> know, and appoint a
               time for him to visit her. <span class="person">Gulfardo</span> thereupon chose a convenient
               time, and hied him to Guasparruolo, to whom: I am come,
               quoth he, about a little matter of business which I have on hand,
               	for which I require two hundred florins of gold, and I should be glad
               	if thou wouldst lend them me at the rate of interest which thou
               	art wont to charge me. That gladly will I, replied Guasparruolo,
               and told out the money at once. A few days later Guasparruolo
               being gone to <span class="place">Genoa</span>, as the lady had said, she sent word to <span class="person">Gulfardo</span>
               that
               he should bring her the two hundred florins of gold. So <span class="person">Gulfardo</span>
               hied him with his comrade to the lady's house, where he found
               her expecting him, and lost no time in handing her the two
               hundred florins of gold in his comrade's presence, saying: You
               	will keep the money, Madam, and give it to your husband when he returns.
               Witting not why <span class="person">Gulfardo</span> so said, but thinking that 'twas
               but to conceal from his comrade that it was given by way of price,
               the lady made answer: That will I gladly; but I must first see
               	whether the amount is right; whereupon she told the florins out
               upon a table, and when she found that the two hundred were there,
               she put them away in high glee, and turning to <span class="person">Gulfardo</span>, took him
               into her chamber, where, not on that night only but on many
               another night, while her husband was away, he had of her all that
               he craved. On Guasparruolo's return <span class="person">Gulfardo</span> presently paid him a
               visit, having first made sure that the lady would be with him, and so
               in her presence: Guasparruolo, quoth he, I had after all no
               	occasion for the money, to wit, the two hundred florins of gold that
               	thou didst lend me the other day, being unable to carry through the
               	transaction for which I borrowed them, and so I took an early opportunity
               	of bringing them to thy wife, and gave them to her: thou
               	wilt therefore cancel the account. Whereupon Guasparruolo
               turned to the lady, and asked her if she had had them. She, not
               daring to deny the fact in presence of the witness, answered:
               Why, yes, I had them, and quite forgot to tell thee. 
               Good,
               quoth then Guasparruolo, we are quits, <span class="person">Gulfardo</span>; make thy mind
               	easy; I will see that thy account is set right. 
               <span class="person">Gulfardo</span> then
               withdrew, leaving the flouted lady to hand over her ill-gotten gains
               to her husband; and so the astute lover had his pleasure of his greedy
               mistress for nothing.

               <p>Fair my ladies, it occurs to
                  	me to tell you a short story, which reflects no credit on those by
                  	whom we are continually wronged without being able to retaliate, to
                  	wit, the priests, who have instituted a crusade against our wives, and
                  	deem that, when they have made conquest of one of them, they have
                  	done a work every whit as worthy of recompense by remission of sin
                  	and punishment as if they had brought the Soldan in chains to <span class="place">Avignon</span>:
                  	in which respect 'tis not possible for the hapless laity to be
                  	even with them: howbeit they are as hot to make reprisals on the
                  	priests' mothers, sisters, mistresses, and daughters as the priests to
                  	attack their wives. Wherefore I am minded to give you, as I may
                  	do in few words, the history of a rustic amour, the conclusion whereof
                  	was not a little laughable, nor barren of moral, for you may also
                  	gather therefrom, that 'tis not always well to believe everything
                  	that a priest says.
               </p>
            </div>
            <p>I say then, that at <span class="place">Varlungo</span>, a village hard by here, as all of you,
               my ladies, should wot either of your own knowledge or by report,
               there dwelt a worthy priest, and doughty of body in the service of
               the ladies: who, albeit he was none too quick at his book, had no lack
               of precious and blessed solecisms to edify his flock withal of a
               Sunday under the elm. And when the men were out of doors, he
               would visit their wives as never a priest had done before him, bringing
               them feast-day gowns and holy water, and now and again a bit of
               candle, and giving them his blessing. Now it so befell that among
               those of his fair parishioners whom he most affected the first place
               was at length taken by one Monna <span class="person">Belcolore</span>, the wife of a husbandman
               that called himself Bentivegna del Mazzo. And in good sooth
               she was a winsome and lusty country lass, brown as a berry and
               buxom enough, and fitter than e'er another for his mill. Moreover
               she had not her match in playing the tabret and singing: The
               borage is full sappy,
               
               For this folk-song see Cantilene e Ballate,
               	Strambotti e Madrigali, ed.
               	Carducci (1871), p. 60. The fragment there printed may be freely rendered
               	as follows:
               		  The borage is full sappy,
               	  And clusters red we see,
               	  And my love would make me happy;
               	  So that maiden give to me.
               	
               		  Ill set I find this dance,
               	  And better might it be:
               	  So, comrade mine, advance,
               	  And, changing place with me,
               	  Stand thou thy love beside.
               	
                
               
               and in leading a brawl or a breakdown, no
               matter who might be next her, with a fair and dainty kerchief in her
               hand. Which spells so wrought upon Master Priest, that for love
               of her he grew distracted, and did nought all day long but loiter
               about the village on the chance of catching sight of her. And if of
               a Sunday morning he espied her in church, he strove might and main
               to acquit himself of his Kyrie and Sanctus in the style of a great
               singer, albeit his performance was liker to the braying of an ass:
               whereas, if he saw her not, he scarce exerted himself at all. However,
               he managed with such discretion that neither Bentivegna del
               Mazzo nor any of the neighbours wist aught of his love. 
               And
               hoping thereby to ingratiate himself with Monna <span class="person">Belcolore</span>, he from
               time to time would send her presents, now a clove of fresh garlic, the
               best in all the country-side, from his own garden, which he tilled with
               his own hands, and anon a basket of beans or a bunch of chives or
               shallots; and, when he thought it might serve his turn, he would 
               give
               her a sly glance, and follow it up with a little amorous mocking
               and mowing, which she, with rustic awkwardness, feigned not to
               understand, and ever maintained her reserve, so that Master Priest
               made no headway.
            </p>
            <p>Now it so befell that one day, when the priest at high noon was
               aimlessly gadding about the village, he encountered Bentivegna del
               Mazzo at the tail of a well laden ass, and greeted him, asking him
               whither he was going. 
               I'faith, Sir, quoth Bentivegna, for sure
               'tis to town I go, having an affair or two to attend to there; and I
               am taking these things to Ser Buonaccorri da Ginestreto, to get him
               to stand by me in I wot not what matter, whereof the justice
               o' th' coram has by his provoker served me with a pertrumpery
               summons to appear before him. 
               Whereupon: 'Tis well, my
               son, quoth the priest, overjoyed, my blessing go with thee: good
               luck to thee and a speedy return; and harkye, shouldst thou see
               <span class="person">Lapuccio</span> or <span class="person">Naldino</span>, do not forget to tell them to send me those
               thongs for my flails. 
               It shall be done, quoth Bentivegna, and
               jogged on towards <span class="place">Florence</span>, while the priest, thinking that now was
               his time to hie him to <span class="person">Belcolore</span> and try his fortune, put his best
               leg forward, and stayed not till he was at the house, which entering,
               he said: God be gracious to us! Who is within? 
               <span class="person">Belcolore</span>,
               who was up in the loft, made answer: Welcome, Sir; but what
               dost thou, gadding about in the heat? 
               Why, as I hope for
               God's blessing, quoth he, I am just come to stay with thee a
               while, having met thy husband on his way to town. 
               Whereupon
               down came <span class="person">Belcolore</span>, took a seat, and began sifting cabbage-seed
               that her husband had lately threshed. By and by the priest began:
               So, <span class="person">Belcolore</span>, wilt thou keep me ever a dying thus? 
               Whereat
               <span class="person">Belcolore</span> tittered, and said: Why, what is't I do to you?
               Truly, nothing at all, replied the priest: but thou sufferest me
               not to do to thee that which I had lief, and which God commands.
               Now away with you! returned <span class="person">Belcolore</span>, do priests do that
               sort of thing? 
               Indeed we do, quoth the priest, and to better
               purpose than others: why not? I tell you our grinding is far
               better; and wouldst thou know why? 'tis because 'tis intermittent.
               And in truth 'twill be well worth thy while to keep thine own
               counsel, and let me do it. 
               Worth my while! ejaculated
               <span class="person">Belcolore</span>. How may that be? There is never a one of you but would
               overreach the very Devil. 
               'Tis not for me to say,
               returned the priest; say but what thou wouldst have: shall it be
               a pair of dainty shoes? Or wouldst thou prefer a fillet? Or
               perchance a gay riband? What's thy will? 
               Marry, no lack
               have I, quoth <span class="person">Belcolore</span>, of such things as these. But, if you
               wish me so well, why do me not a service? and I would then be
               at your command. 
               Name but the service, returned the priest,
               and gladly will I do it. 
               Quoth then <span class="person">Belcolore</span>: On Saturday
               I have to go to <span class="place">Florence</span> to deliver some wool that I have spun,
               and to get my spinning-wheel put in order: lend me but five
               pounds--I know you have them--and I will redeem my perse
               petticoat from the pawnshop, and also the girdle that I wear on
               saints' days, and that I had when I was married--you see that
               without them I cannot go to church or anywhere else, and then I
               will do just as you wish thenceforth and forever. 
               Whereupon:
               So God give me a good year, quoth he, as I have not the
               money with me: but never fear that I will see that thou hast it
               before Saturday with all the pleasure in life. 
               Ay, ay, rejoined
               <span class="person">Belcolore</span>, you all make great promises, but then you never keep
               them. Think you to serve me as you served <span class="person">Biliuzza</span>, whom you
               left in the lurch at last? God's faith, you do not so. To think
               that she turned woman of the world just for that! If you have
               not the money with you, why, go and get it. 
               Prithee, returned
               the priest, send me not home just now. For, seest thou, 'tis the
               very nick of time with me, and the coast is clear, and perchance it
               might not be so on my return, and in short I know not when it
               would be likely to go so well as now. 
               Whereto she did but
               rejoin: Good; if you are minded to go, get you gone; if not,
               stay where you are. 
               The priest, therefore, seeing that she was
               not disposed to give him what he wanted, as he was fain, to wit, on
               his own terms, but was bent upon having a quid pro quo, changed
               his tone; and: Lo, now, quoth he, thou doubtest I will not
               bring thee the money; so to set thy mind at rest, I will leave thee
               this cloak--thou seest 'tis good sky-blue silk--in pledge. 
               So raising
               her head and glancing at the cloak: And what may the cloak be
               worth? quoth <span class="person">Belcolore</span>. 
               Worth! ejaculated the priest: I
               would have thee know that 'tis all Douai, not to say Trouai,
               make: nay, there are some of our folk here that say 'tis Quadrouai; and
               'tis not a fortnight since I bought it of <span class="person">Lotto</span>, the secondhand
               dealer, for seven good pounds, and then had it five good soldi
               under value, by what I hear from <span class="person">Buglietto</span>, who, thou knowest,
               is an excellent judge of these articles. 
               Oh! say you so?
               exclaimed <span class="person">Belcolore</span>. So help me God, I should not have thought
               it; however, let me look at it. 
               So Master Priest, being ready for
               action, doffed the cloak and handed it to her. And she, having
               put it in a safe place, said to him: Now, Sir, we will away to
               the hut; there is never a soul goes there; and so they did. 
               And
               there Master Priest, giving her many a mighty buss and straining
               her to his sacred person, solaced himself with her no little while.
            </p>
            <p>Which done, he hied him away in his cassock, as if he were come
               from officiating at a wedding; but, when he was back in his holy
               quarters, he bethought him that not all the candles that he received
               by way of offering in the course of an entire year would amount to
               the half of five pounds, and saw that he had made a bad bargain,
               and repented him that he had left the cloak in pledge, and cast
               about how he might recover it without paying anything. 
               And as
               he did not lack cunning, he hit upon an excellent expedient, by
               which he compassed his end. So on the morrow, being a saint's
               day, he sent a neighbour's lad to Monna <span class="person">Belcolore</span> with a request
               that she would be so good as to lend him her stone mortar, for that
               Binguccio dal Poggio and Nuto Buglietti were to breakfast with
               him that morning, and he therefore wished to make a sauce.
               <span class="person">Belcolore</span> having sent the mortar, 
               the priest, about breakfast time,
               reckoning that Bentivegna del Mazzo and <span class="person">Belcolore</span> would be at
               their meal, called his clerk, and said to him: Take the mortar
               back to <span class="person">Belcolore</span>, and say: 'My master thanks you very kindly,
               and bids you return the cloak that the lad left with you in pledge.'
               The clerk took the mortar to <span class="person">Belcolore</span>'s house, where, finding her
               at table with Bentivegna, he set the mortar down and delivered the
               priest's message. Whereto <span class="person">Belcolore</span> would fain have demurred;
               but Bentivegna gave her a threatening glance, saying: So, then,
               thou takest a pledge from Master Priest? By Christ, I vow, I
               have half a mind to give thee a great clout o' the chin. Go, give
               it back at once, a murrain on thee! And look to it that whatever
               he may have a mind to, were it our very ass, he be never denied.
               So, with a very bad grace, <span class="person">Belcolore</span> got up, and went to the wardrobe,
               and took out the cloak, and gave it to the clerk, saying:
               Tell thy master from me: Would to God he may never ply pestle
               in my mortar again, such honour has he done me for this turn!
               So the clerk returned with the cloak, and delivered the message to
               Master Priest; who, laughing, made answer: Tell her, when
               thou next seest her, that, so she lend us not the mortar, I will not
               lend her the pestle: be it tit for tat.
            </p>
            <p>Bentivegna made no account of his wife's words, deeming that
               'twas but his chiding that had provoked them. But <span class="person">Belcolore</span> was
               not a little displeased with Master Priest, and had never a word to say
               to him till the vintage; after which, what with the salutary fear in
               which she stood of the mouth of Lucifer the Great, to which he
               threatened to consign her, and the must and roast chestnuts that he
               sent her, she made it up with him, and many a jolly time they had
               together. And though she got not the five pounds from him, he put
               a new skin on her tabret, and fitted it with a little bell, wherewith
               she was satisfied.

            <p>In our city, where there has never been lack of odd humours
               and queer folk, there dwelt, no long time ago, a painter named
               <span class="person">Calandrino</span>, a simple soul, of uncouth manners, that spent most of
               his time with two other painters, the one Bruno, the other
               Buffalmacco, by name, pleasant fellows enough, but not without
               their full share of sound and shrewd sense, and who kept with
               <span class="person">Calandrino</span> for that they not seldom found his singular ways and
               his simplicity very diverting. There was also at the same time
               at <span class="place">Florence</span> one Maso del Saggio, a fellow marvellously entertaining
               by his cleverness, dexterity and unfailing resource; who having
               heard somewhat touching <span class="person">Calandrino</span>'s simplicity, resolved to make
               fun of him by playing him a trick, and inducing him to believe
               some prodigy. And happening one day to come upon <span class="person">Calandrino</span> in
               the church of <span class="place">San Giovanni</span>, where he sate intently regarding the
               paintings and intaglios of the tabernacle above the altar, which had
               then
               but lately been set there, he deemed time and place convenient
               for the execution of his design; which he accordingly imparted to
               one of his comrades: whereupon the two men drew nigh the place
               where <span class="person">Calandrino</span> sate alone, and feigning not to see him fell a
               talking of the virtues of divers stones, of which Maso spoke as aptly
               and pertinently as if he had been a great and learned lapidary.
               <span class="person">Calandrino</span> heard what passed between them, and witting that 'twas
               no secret, after a while got up, and joined them, to Maso's no small
               delight. He therefore continued his discourse, and being asked by
               <span class="person">Calandrino</span>, where these stones of such rare virtues were to be found,
               made answer: 
               Chiefly in <span class="place">Berlinzone</span>, in the <span class="place">land of the Basques</span>.
               	The district is called <span class="place">Bengodi</span>, and there they bind the vines with
               	sausages, and a denier will buy a goose and a gosling into the
               	bargain; and on a mountain, all of grated Parmesan cheese, dwell
               	folk that do nought else but make macaroni and raviuoli,A sort of
               	  rissole. and boil
               	them in capon's broth, and then throw them down to be scrambled
               	for; and hard by flows a rivulet of Vernaccia, the best that ever
               	was drunk, and never a drop of water therein. 
               Ah! 'tis a sweet
               	country! quoth <span class="person">Calandrino</span>; but tell me, what becomes of the
               	capons that they boil? 
               They are all eaten by the Basques,
               replied Maso. 
               Then: Wast thou ever there? quoth <span class="person">Calandrino</span>.
               Whereupon: Was I ever there, sayst thou? replied Maso.
               Why, if I have been there once, I have been there a thousand
               	times. 
               And how many miles is't from here? quoth <span class="person">Calandrino</span>.
               Oh! returned Maso, more than thou couldst number in a night
               	without slumber. 
               Farther off, then, than the <span class="place">Abruzzi</span>? said
               <span class="person">Calandrino</span>. 
               Why, yes, 'tis a bit farther, replied Maso.
            </p>
            <p>Now <span class="person">Calandrino</span>, like the simple soul that he was, marking the
               composed and grave countenance with which Maso spoke, could not
               have believed him more thoroughly, if he had uttered the most patent
               truth, and thus taking his words for gospel: 'Tis a trifle too far
               for my purse, quoth he; were it nigher, I warrant thee, I
               would go with thee thither one while, just to see the macaroni
               come tumbling down, and take my fill thereof. But tell me, so good
               luck befall thee, are none of these stones, that have these rare virtues,
               to be found in these regions? 
               Ay, replied Maso, two sorts of
               stone
               are found there, both of virtues extraordinary. The one sort
               are the sandstones of <span class="place">Settignano</span> and <span class="place">Montisci</span>, which being made
               into millstones, by virtue thereof flour is made; wherefore 'tis a
               common saying in those countries that blessings come from God and
               millstones from <span class="place">Montisci</span>: but, for that these sandstones are in great
               plenty, they are held cheap by us, just as by them are emeralds,
               whereof they have mountains, bigger than <span class="place">Monte Morello</span>, that shine
               at midnight, a God's name! And know this, that whoso should make
               a goodly pair of millstones, and connect them with a ring before ever
               a hole was drilled in them, and take them to the Soldan, should get
               all he would have thereby. The other sort of stone is the heliotrope,
               as we lapidaries call it, a stone of very great virtue, inasmuch as
               whoso carries it on his person is seen, so long as he keep it, by never
               another soul, where he is not. 
               These be virtues great indeed,
               quoth <span class="person">Calandrino</span>; but where is this second stone to be found?
               Whereto Maso made answer that there were usually some to be
               found in the <span class="place">Mugnone</span>. 
               And what are its size and colour? quoth
               <span class="person">Calandrino</span>. The size varies, replied Maso, for some are bigger
               and some smaller than others; but all are of the same colour, being
               nearly black. 
               All these matters duly marked and fixed in his memory,
               <span class="person">Calandrino</span> made as if he had other things to attend to, and took his
               leave of Maso with the intention of going in quest of the stone, but
               not until he had let his especial friends, Bruno and Buffalmacco,
               know of his project. 
               So, that no time might be lost, but, postponing
               everything else, they might begin the quest at once, he set about
               looking for them, and spent the whole morning in the search. 
               At
               length, when 'twas already past none, he called to mind that they
               would be at work in the Faentine women's convent, and though
               'twas excessively hot, he let nothing stand in his way, but at a pace
               that was more like a run than a walk, hied him thither; and so soon
               as he had made them ware of his presence, thus he spoke: 
               Comrades,
               	so you are but minded to hearken to me, 'tis in our power to
               	become the richest men in <span class="place">Florence</span>; for I am informed by one that
               	may be trusted that there is a kind of stone in the <span class="place">Mugnone</span> which
               	renders whoso carries it invisible to every other soul in the world.
               	Wherefore, methinks, we were wise to let none have the start of us,
               	but go search for this stone without any delay. 
               	We shall find it
               	without a doubt, for I know what 'tis like, and when we have found it,
               we have but to put it in the purse, and get us to the moneychangers,
               	whose counters, as you know, are always laden with groats
               and florins, and help ourselves to as many as we have a mind to.
               	No one will see us, and so, hey presto! we shall be rich folk in the
               	twinkling of an eye, and have no more need to go besmearing the
               	walls all day long like so many snails. 
               Whereat Bruno and Buffalmacco
               began only to laugh, and exchanging glances, made as if they
               marvelled exceedingly, and expressed approval of <span class="person">Calandrino</span>'s project.
               Then Buffalmacco asked, what might be the name of the stone.
               <span class="person">Calandrino</span>, like the numskull that he was, had already forgotten the
               name: so he made answer: Why need we concern ourselves
               	with the name, since we know the stone's virtue? methinks, we
               	were best to go look for it, and waste no more time. 
               Well, well,
               said Bruno, but what are the size and shape of the stone? 
               They
               	are of all sizes and shapes, said <span class="person">Calandrino</span>, but they are all pretty
               	nearly black; wherefore, methinks, we were best to collect all the
               	black stones that we see until we hit upon it: and so, let us be off,
               	and lose no more time. 
               Nay, but, said Bruno, wait a bit.
               And turning to Buffalmacco: Methinks, quoth he, that <span class="person">Calandrino</span>
               	says well: but I doubt this is not the time for such work,
               	seeing that the sun is high, and his rays so flood the <span class="place">Mugnone</span> as to
               	dry all the stones; insomuch that stones will now shew as white
               	that in the morning, before the sun had dried them, would shew as
               	black: 
               	besides which, to-day being a working-day, there will be for
               	one cause or another folk not a few about the <span class="place">Mugnone</span>, who, seeing
               	us, might guess what we were come for, and peradventure do the like
               	themselves; whereby it might well be that they found the stone, and
               	we might miss the trot by trying after the amble. 
               	Wherefore, so
               	you agree, methinks we were best to go about it in the morning,
               	when we shall be better able to distinguish the black stones from the
               	white, and on a holiday, when there will be none to see us.
            </p>
            <p>Buffalmacco's advice being approved by Bruno, <span class="person">Calandrino</span>
               chimed in; and so 'twas arranged that they should all three go in
               quest of the stone on the following Sunday. So <span class="person">Calandrino</span>, having
               besought his companions above all things to let never a soul in the
               world hear aught of the matter, for that it had been imparted to him
               in strict confidence, and having told them what he had heard touching
               the land of <span class="place">Bengodi</span>, the truth of which he affirmed with oaths, took
               leave of them; and they concerted their plan, while <span class="person">Calandrino</span>
               impatiently expected the Sunday morning. Whereon, about dawn,
               he arose, and called them; and forth they issued by the Porta a San
               Gallo, and hied them to the <span class="place">Mugnone</span>, and following its course,
               began their quest of the stone, <span class="person">Calandrino</span>, as was natural, leading
               the way, and jumping lightly from rock to rock, and wherever he
               espied a black stone, stooping down, picking it up and putting it in
               the fold of his tunic, while his comrades followed, picking up a stone
               here and a stone there. Thus it was that <span class="person">Calandrino</span> had not gone
               far, before, finding that there was no more room in his tunic, he lifted
               the skirts of his gown, which was not cut after the fashion of
               Hainault, and gathering them under his leathern girdle and making
               them fast on every side, thus furnished himself with a fresh and
               capacious lap, which, however, taking no long time to fill, he made
               another lap out of his cloak, which in like manner he soon filled
               with stones. Wherefore, Bruno and Buffalmacco seeing that
               <span class="person">Calandrino</span> was well laden, and that 'twas nigh upon breakfast-time,
               and the moment for action come: Where is <span class="person">Calandrino</span>?
               quoth Bruno to Buffalmacco. Whereto Buffalmacco, who had
               <span class="person">Calandrino</span> full in view, having first turned about and looked here,
               there and everywhere, made answer: That wot not I; but not
               	so long ago he was just in front of us. 
               Not so long ago,
               	forsooth,
               returned Bruno; 'tis my firm belief that at this very moment he is
               at breakfast at home, having left to us this wild-goose chase of black
               	stones in the <span class="place">Mugnone</span>. 
               Marry, quoth Buffalmacco, he did but
               	serve us right so to trick us and leave, seeing that we were so silly as
               	to believe him. Why, who could have thought that any but we
               	would have been so foolish as to believe that a stone of such rare
               	virtue was to be found in the <span class="place">Mugnone</span>? 
               <span class="person">Calandrino</span>, hearing their
               colloquy, forthwith imagined that he had the stone in his hand, and
               by its virtue, though present, was invisible to them; and overjoyed by
               such good fortune, would not say a word to undeceive them, but
               determined to hie him home, and accordingly faced about, and put
               himself in motion. 
               Whereupon: Ay! quoth Buffalmacco
               to Bruno, what are we about that we go not back too? 
               Go we
               	then, said Bruno; but by God I swear that <span class="person">Calandrino</span> shall
               	never play me another such trick; and as to this, were I nigh him,
               	as I have been all the morning, I would teach him to remember it for
               	a month or so, such a reminder would I give him in the heel
               	with this stone. And even as he spoke he threw back his arm, and
               launched the stone against <span class="person">Calandrino</span>'s heel. Galled by the blow,
               <span class="person">Calandrino</span> gave a great hop and a slight gasp, but said nothing, and
               halted not. Then, picking out one of the stones that he had
               collected: Bruno, quoth Buffalmacco, see what a goodly
               	stone I have here, would it might but catch <span class="person">Calandrino</span> in the
               	back; and forthwith he discharged it with main force upon the
               said back. And in short, suiting action to word, now in this way,
               now in that, they stoned him all the way up the <span class="place">Mugnone</span> as far as
               the <span class="place">Porta a San Gallo</span>. There they threw away the stones they had
               picked up, and tarried a while with the customs' officers, who, being
               primed by them, had let <span class="person">Calandrino</span> pass unchallenged, while their
               laughter knew no bounds.
            </p>
            <p>So <span class="person">Calandrino</span>, halting nowhere, betook him to his house, which
               was hard by the corner of the Macina. And so well did Fortune
               prosper the trick, that all the way by the stream and across the city
               there was never a soul that said a word to <span class="person">Calandrino</span>, and indeed he
               encountered but few, for most folk were at breakfast. But no
               sooner was <span class="person">Calandrino</span> thus gotten home with his stones, than it so
               happened that his good lady, Monna Tessa, shewed her fair face at
               the stair's head, and catching sight of him, and being somewhat
               annoyed by his long delay, chid him, saying: What the Devil
               	brings thee here so late? Must breakfast wait thee until all other
               	folk have had it? <span class="person">Calandrino</span> caught the words, and angered and
               mortified to find that he was not invisible, broke out with: Alas!
               	curst woman! so 'twas thou! Thou hast undone me: but, God's
               	faith, I will pay thee out. Whereupon he was upstairs in a trice,
               and having discharged his great load of stones in a parlour, rushed
               with fell intent upon his wife, and laid hold of her by the hair, and
               threw her down at his feet, and beat and kicked her in every part of
               her person with all the force he had in his arms and legs, insomuch
               that he left never a hair of her head or bone of her body unscathed,
               and 'twas all in vain that she laid her palms together and crossed her
               fingers and cried for mercy.
            </p>
            <p>Now Buffalmacco and Bruno, after making merry a while with
               the warders of the gate, had set off again at a leisurely pace, keeping
               some distance behind <span class="person">Calandrino</span>. Arrived at his door, they heard the
               noise of the sound thrashing that he was giving his wife; and
               making as if they were but that very instant come upon the scene,
               they called him. <span class="person">Calandrino</span>, flushed, all of a sweat, and out of
               breath, shewed himself at the window, and bade them come up.
               They, putting on a somewhat angry air, did so; and espied <span class="person">Calandrino</span>
               sitting in the parlour, amid the stones which lay all about,
               untrussed, and puffing with the air of a man spent with exertion,
               while his lady lay in one of the corners, weeping bitterly, her hair all
               dishevelled, her clothes torn to shreds, and her face livid, bruised and
               battered. So after surveying the room a while: What means
               this, <span class="person">Calandrino</span>? quoth they. Art thou minded to build thee a
               wall, that we see so many stones about? And then, as they received
               no answer, they continued: And how's this? How comes
               Monna Tessa in this plight? 'Twould seem thou hast given her a
               beating! What unheard-of doings are these? 
               What with the
               weight of the stones that he had carried, and the fury with which he
               had beaten his wife, and the mortification that he felt at the miscarriage
               of his enterprise, <span class="person">Calandrino</span> was too spent to utter a word
               by way of reply. Wherefore in a menacing tone Buffalmacco began
               again: 
               However out of sorts thou mayst have been, <span class="person">Calandrino</span>,
               thou shouldst not have played us so scurvy a trick as thou hast. To
               take us with thee to the <span class="place">Mugnone</span> in quest of this stone of rare
               virtue, and then, without so much as saying either God-speed or
               Devil-speed, to be off, and leave us there like a couple of gowks!
               We take it not a little unkindly: and rest assured that thou shalt
               never so fool us again. 
               Whereto with an effort <span class="person">Calandrino</span> replied:
               Comrades, be not wroth with me: 'tis not as you think.
               I, luckless wight! found the stone: listen, and you will no longer
               doubt that I say sooth. When you began saying one to the other:
               'Where is <span class="person">Calandrino</span>?' I was within ten paces of you, and marking
               that you came by without seeing me, I went before, and so, keeping
               ever a little ahead of you, I came hither. 
               And then he told them the
               whole story of what they had said and done from beginning to end,
               and shewed them his back and heel, how they had been mauled by
               the stones; after which: 
               And I tell you, he went on, that,
               laden though I was with all these stones, that you see here, never a
               word was said to me by the warders of the gate as I passed in, though
               you know how vexatious and grievous these warders are wont to make
               themselves in their determination to see everything: and moreover
               I met by the way several of my gossips and friends that are ever
               wont to greet me, and ask me to drink, and never a word said any or
               them to me, no, nor half a word either; but they passed me by as
               men that saw me not. But at last, being come home, I was met
               and seen by this devil of a woman, curses upon her, forasmuch as all
               things, as you know, lose their virtue in the presence of a woman;
               whereby I from being the most lucky am become the most luckless
               man in <span class="place">Florence</span>: and therefore I thrashed her as long as I could stir
               a hand, nor know I wherefore I forbear to sluice her veins for her,
               cursed be the hour that first I saw her, cursed be the hour that I
               brought her into the house! And so, kindling with fresh wrath, he
               was about to start up and give her another thrashing; when Buffalmacco
               and Bruno, who had listened to his story with an air of great
               surprise, and affirmed its truth again and again, while they all but burst
               with suppressed laughter, seeing him now frantic to renew his assault
               upon his wife, got up and withstood and held him back, averring that
               the lady was in no wise to blame for what had happened, but only he,
               who, witting that things lost their virtue in the presence of women, had
               not bidden her keep aloof from him that day; which precaution God
               had not suffered him to take, either because the luck was not to be
               his, or because he was minded to cheat his comrades, to whom he
               should have shewn the stone as soon as he found it. And so, with
               many words they hardly prevailed upon him to forgive his injured
               wife, and leaving him to rue the ill-luck that had filled his house
               with stones, went their way.

               <p>Noble ladies,
                  	how we are teased and tormented by these priests and friars, and
                  	indeed by clergy of all sorts, I mind me to have been set forth in

                  	gentlewoman, whether she would or no. Which gentlewoman,
                  	being discreet above a little, treated him as he deserved.
               </p>
            </div>
            <p><span class="place">Fiesole</span>, whose hill is here within sight, is, as each of you knows,
               a city of immense antiquity, and was aforetime great, though now
               'tis fallen into complete decay; which notwithstanding, it always was,
               and still is the see of a bishop. Now there was once a gentlewoman,
               Monna Piccarda by name, a widow, that had an estate at <span class="place">Fiesole</span>,
               hard by the cathedral, on which, for that she was not in the easiest
               circumstances, she lived most part of the year, and with her her two
               brothers, very worthy and courteous young men, both of them.
               And the lady being wont frequently to resort to the cathedral, and
               being still quite young and fair and debonair withal, it so befell that
               the rector grew in the last degree enamoured of her, and waxed at
               length so bold, that he himself avowed his passion to the lady, praying
               her
               to entertain his love, and requite it in like measure. 
               The rector
               was advanced in years, but otherwise the veriest springald, being bold
               and of a high spirit, of a boundless conceit of himself, and of mien
               and manners most affected and in the worst taste, and withal so tiresome
               and insufferable that he was on bad terms with everybody, and,
               if with one person more than another, with this lady, who not only
               cared not a jot for him, but had liefer have had a headache than his
               company. Wherefore the lady discreetly made answer: I may
               well prize your love, Sir, and love you I should and will right gladly;
               but such love as yours and mine may never admit of aught that is
               not honourable. You are my spiritual father and a priest, and now
               verging towards old age, circumstances which should ensure your
               honour and chastity; and I, on my part, am no longer a girl, such
               as these love affairs might beseem, but a widow, and well you wot
               how it behoves widows to be chaste. Wherefore I pray you to have
               me excused; for, after the sort you crave, you shall never have my
               love, nor would I in such sort be loved by you. 
               With this answer
               the rector was for the nonce fain to be content; but he was not the
               man to be dismayed and routed by a first repulse; and with his
               wonted temerity and effrontery he plied her again and again with
               letters and ambassages, and also by word of mouth, when he espied
               her entering the church. Wherefore the lady finding this persecution
               more grievous and harassing than she could well bear, cast about how
               she might be quit thereof in such fashion as he deserved, seeing that
               he left her no choice; howbeit she would do nought in the matter
               until she had conferred with her brothers. She therefore told them
               how the rector pursued her, and how she meant to foil him; and,
               with their full concurrence, some few days afterwards she went, as
               she was wont, to church. The rector no sooner saw her, than he
               approached and accosted her, as he was wont, in a tone of easy
               familiarity. The lady greeted him, as he came up, with a glance
               of gladsome recognition; and when he had treated her to not a little
               of his wonted eloquence, she drew him aside, and heaving a great
               sigh, said: 
               I have oftentimes heard it said, Sir, that there is no
               castle so strong, but that, if the siege be continued day by day, it
               will sooner or later be taken; which I now plainly perceive is my
               own case. For so fairly have you hemmed me in with this, that, and
               the other pretty speech or the like blandishments, that you have
               constrained
               me to make nought of my former resolve, and, seeing that I
               find such favour with you, to surrender myself unto you. 
               Whereto,
               overjoyed, the rector made answer: Madam, I am greatly
               honoured; and, sooth to say, I marvelled not a little how you should
               hold out so long, seeing that I have never had the like experience
               with any other woman, insomuch that I have at times said: 'Were
               women of silver, they would not be worth a denier, for there is none
               but would give under the hammer.' But no more of this: when and
               where may we come together? 
               Sweet my lord, replied the lady,
               for the when, 'tis just as we may think best, for I have no husband
               to whom to render account of my nights, but the where passes my
               wit to conjecture. 
               How so? quoth the rector. Why not in
               your own house? 
               Sir, replied the lady, you know that I have
               two brothers, both young men, who day and night bring their comrades
               into the house, which is none too large: for which reason it
               might not be done there, unless we were minded to make ourselves,
               as it were, dumb and blind, uttering never a word, not so much as a
               monosyllable, and abiding in the dark: in such sort indeed it might
               be, because they do not intrude upon my chamber; but theirs is so
               near to mine that the very least whisper could not but be heard.
               Nay but, Madam, returned the rector, let not this stand in our
               way for a night or two, until I may bethink me where else we might
               be more at our ease. 
               Be that as you will, Sir, quoth the lady,
               I do but entreat that the affair be kept close, so that never a word
               of it get wind. 
               Have no fear on that score, Madam, replied the
               priest; and if so it may be, let us forgather to-night. 
               With
               pleasure, returned the lady; and having appointed him how and
               when to come, she left him and went home.
            </p>
            <p>Now the lady had a maid, that was none too young, and had a
               countenance the ugliest and most misshapen that ever was seen; for
               indeed she was flat-nosed, wry-mouthed, and thick-lipped, with huge,
               ill-set teeth, eyes that squinted and were ever bleared, and a complexion
               betwixt green and yellow, that shewed as if she had spent the
               summer not at <span class="place">Fiesole</span> but at Sinigaglia: besides which she was hipshot
               and somewhat halting on the right side. 
               Her name was Ciuta,
               but, for that she was such a scurvy bitch to look upon, she was called
               by all folk <span class="person">Ciutazza</span>.An augmentative form, with a suggestion of
               cagnazza, bitch-like. And being thus misshapen of body, she
               was
               also not without her share of guile. So the lady called her and said:
               <span class="person">Ciutazza</span>, so thou wilt do me a service to-night, I will give thee
               a fine new shift. 
               At the mention of the shift <span class="person">Ciutazza</span> made
               answer: So you give me a shift, Madam, I will throw myself
               into the very fire. 
               Good, said the lady; then I would have
               thee lie to-night in my bed with a man, whom thou wilt caress; but
               look thou say never a word, that my brothers, who, as thou knowest,
               sleep in the next room, hear thee not; and afterwards I will give
               thee the shift. 
               Sleep with a man! quoth <span class="person">Ciutazza</span>: why, if
               need be, I will sleep with six. 
               So in the evening Master Rector
               came, as he had been bidden; and the two young men, as the lady
               had arranged, being in their room, and making themselves very audible,
               he stole noiselessly, and in the dark, into the lady's room, and got
               him on to the bed, which <span class="person">Ciutazza</span>, well advised by the lady how to
               behave, mounted from the other side. 
               Whereupon Master Rector,
               thinking to have the lady by his side, took <span class="person">Ciutazza</span> in his arms, and
               fell a kissing her, saying never a word the while, and <span class="person">Ciutazza</span> did
               the like; and so he enjoyed her, plucking the boon which he had so
               long desired.
            </p>
            <p>The rector and <span class="person">Ciutazza</span> thus closeted, the lady charged her
               brothers to execute the rest of her plan. They accordingly stole
               quietly out of their room, and hied them to the piazza, where
               Fortune proved propitious beyond what they had craved of her; for,
               it being a very hot night, the bishop had been seeking them, purposing
               to go home with them, and solace himself with their society, and
               quench his thirst. With which desire he acquainted them, as soon
               as he espied them coming into the piazza; and so they escorted him
               to their house, and there in the cool of their little courtyard, which
               was bright with many a lamp, he took, to his no small comfort, a
               draught of their good wine. Which done: Sir, said the young
               men, since of your great courtesy you have deigned to visit our poor
               	house, to which we were but now about to invite you, we should be
               	gratified if you would be pleased to give a look at somewhat, a mere
               	trifle though it be, which we have here to shew you. 
               The bishop
               replied that he would do so with pleasure. Whereupon one of the
               young men took a lighted torch and led the way, the bishop and
               the rest following, to the chamber where Master Rector lay with
               <span class="person">Ciutazza</span>.
            </p>
            <p>Now the rector, being in hot haste, had ridden hard, insomuch
               that he was already gotten above three miles on his way when they
               arrived; and so, being somewhat tired, he was resting, but, hot
               though the night was, he still held <span class="person">Ciutazza</span> in his arms. 
               In which
               posture he was shewn to the bishop, when, preceded by the young
               man bearing the light, and followed by the others, he entered the
               chamber. And being roused, and observing the light and the folk
               that stood about him, Master Rector was mighty ashamed and
               affrighted, and popped his head under the clothes. But the bishop,
               reprimanding him severely, constrained him to thrust his head out
               again, and take a view of his bed-fellow. Thus made aware of the
               trick which the lady had played him, the rector was now, both on
               that score and by reason of his signal disgrace, the saddest man that
               ever was; and his discomfiture was complete, when, having donned
               his clothes, he was committed by the bishop's command to close
               custody and sent to prison, there to expiate his offence by a rigorous
               penance.
            </p>
            <p>The bishop was then fain to know how it had come about that
               he had forgathered there with <span class="person">Ciutazza</span>. Whereupon the young
               men related the whole story; which ended, the bishop commended
               both the lady and the young men not a little, for that they had taken
               condign vengeance upon him without imbruing their hands in the
               blood of a priest. The bishop caused him to bewail his transgression
               forty days; but what with his love, and the scornful requital which
               it had received, he bewailed it more than forty and nine days, not to
               mention that for a great while he could not shew himself in the
               street but the boys would point the finger at him and say:
               There goes he that lay with <span class="person">Ciutazza</span>. Which was such an
               affliction to him that he was like to go mad. On this wise the
               worthy lady rid herself of the rector's vexatious importunity, and
               <span class="person">Ciutazza</span> had a jolly night and earned her shift.

               <p>Sweet my ladies, by what I remember

            </div>
            <p>As you all may well have heard, there come not seldom to our
               city magistrates from the Marches, who for the most part are men
               of a mean spirit, and in circumstances so reduced and beggarly, that
               their whole life seems to be but a petty-foggery; and by reason of
               this their inbred sordidness and avarice they bring with them judges
               and notaries that have rather the air of men taken from the plough
               or the last than trained in the schools of law.It was owing to their
               internal dissensions that the Florentines were
               from time to time fain to introduce these stranger Podestàs.
               Now one of these
               Marchers, being come hither as Podestà, brought with him judges
               not a few, and among them one that called himself Messer Niccola
               da <span class="place">San Lepidio</span>, and looked liker to a locksmith than aught else.
               However, this fellow was assigned with the rest of the judges to
               hear criminal causes. And as folk will often go to the court, though
               they have no concern whatever there, it so befell that Maso del Saggio
               went thither one morning in quest of one of his friends, and
               there chancing to set eyes on this Messer Niccola, where he sate,
               deemed him a fowl of no common feather, and surveyed him from
               head to foot, observing that the vair which he wore on his head was
               all begrimed, that he carried an ink-horn at his girdle, that his gown
               was longer than his robe, and many another detail quite foreign to
               the appearance of a man of birth and breeding, of which that which
               he deemed most notable was a pair of breeches, which, as he saw
               (for the judge's outer garments being none too ample were open in
               front, as he sate), reached half-way down his legs. By which sight his
               mind was presently diverted from the friend whom he came there to
               seek; and forth he hied him in quest of other two of his comrades,
               the one Ribi, the other <span class="person">Matteuzzo</span> by name, fellows both of them
               not a whit less jolly than Maso himself; and having found them, he
               said to them: An you love me, come with me to the court, and
               I will shew you the queerest scarecrow that ever you saw. 
               So the
               two men hied them with him to the court; and there he pointed
               out to them the judge and his breeches. What they saw from a
               distance served to set them laughing: then drawing nearer to the
               daïs on which Master Judge was seated, they observed that 'twas
               easy enough to get under the daïs, and moreover that the plank, on
               which the judge's feet rested, was broken, so that there was plenty
               of room for the passage of a hand and arm. Whereupon quoth
               Maso to his comrades: 'Twere a very easy matter to pull these
               breeches right down: wherefore I propose that we do so. 
               Each
               of the men had marked how it might be done; and so, having
               concerted both what they should do and what they should say, they
               came to the court again next morning; and, the court being
               crowded, <span class="person">Matteuzzo</span>, observed by never a soul, slipped beneath the
               daïs, and posted himself right under the spot where the judge's feet
               rested, while the other two men took their stand on either side of the
               judge, each laying hold of the hem of his robe. Then: Sir, sir, I
               pray you for God's sake, began Maso, that, before the pilfering
               rascal
               that is there beside you can make off, you constrain him to give me
               back a pair of jack boots that he has stolen from me, which theft
               he still denies, though 'tis not a month since I saw him getting
               them resoled. 
               Meanwhile Ribi, at the top of his voice, shouted:
               Believe him not, Sir, the scurvy knave! 'Tis but that he knows that
               I am come to demand restitution of a valise that he has stolen
               from me that he now for the first time trumps up this story about
               a pair of jack boots that I have had in my house down to the last
               day or two; and if you doubt what I say, I can bring as witness
               Trecca, my neighbour, and Grassa, the tripe-woman, and one that
               goes about gathering the sweepings of <span class="place">Santa Maria a Verzaia</span>, who
               saw him when he was on his way back from the farm. But shout
               as he might, Maso was still even with him, nor for all that did Ribi
               bate a jot of his clamour. And while the judge stood, bending now
               towards the one, now towards the other, the better to hear them,
               <span class="person">Matteuzzo</span> seized his opportunity, and thrusting his hand through
               the hole in the plank caught hold of the judge's breeches, and tugged
               at them amain. Whereby down they came straightway, for the
               judge was a lean man, and shrunk in the buttocks. The judge,
               being aware of the accident, but knowing not how it had come
               about, would have gathered his outer garments together in front, so
               as to cover the defect, but Maso on the one side, and Ribi on the
               other, held him fast, shouting amain and in chorus: 
               You do me a
               grievous wrong, Sir, thus to deny me justice, nay, even a hearing,
               and to think of quitting the court: there needs no writ in this city
               for such a trifling matter as this. And thus they held him by the
               clothes and in parley, until all that were in the court perceived that
               he had lost his breeches. However, after a while, <span class="person">Matteuzzo</span>
               dropped the breeches, and slipped off, and out of the court, without
               being observed, and Ribi, deeming that the joke had gone far
               enough, exclaimed: By God, I vow, I will appeal to the Syndics;
               while Maso, on the other side, let go the robe, saying: Nay,
               but for my part, I will come here again and again and again, until I
               find you less embarrassed than you seem to be to-day. And so the
               one this way, the other that way, they made off with all speed.
               Whereupon Master Judge, disbreeched before all the world, was as
               one that awakens from sleep, albeit he was ware of his forlorn
               condition, and asked whither the parties in the case touching the
               jack boots and the valise were gone. However, as they were not
               to be found, he fell a swearing by the bowels of God, that 'twas
               meet and proper that he should know and wit, whether 'twas the
               custom at <span class="place">Florence</span> to disbreech judges sitting in the seat of justice.
            </p>
            <p>When the affair reached the ears of the Podestà, he made no
               little stir about it; but, being informed by some of his friends, that
               'twould not have happened, but that the Florentines were minded
               to shew him, that, in place of the judges he should have brought
               with him, he had brought but gowks, to save expense, he deemed it
               best to say no more about it, and so for that while the matter went
               no further.

                  have but now heard, even so 'tis with me in regard of <span class="person">Calandrino</span>
                  and his comrades, of whom I am minded to tell you another story,
                  which you will, I think, find entertaining.
               </p>
            </div>
            <p>Who <span class="person">Calandrino</span>,
               Bruno and Buffalmacco were, I need not explain; you know them
               well enough from the former story; and therefore I will tarry no
               longer than to say that <span class="person">Calandrino</span> had a little estate not far from
               <span class="place">Florence</span>, which his wife had brought him by way of dowry, and
               which yielded them yearly, among other matters, a pig; and 'twas
               his custom every year in the month of December to resort to the
               farm with his wife, there to see to the killing and salting of the
               said pig. Now, one of these years it so happened that his wife
               being unwell, <span class="person">Calandrino</span> went thither alone to kill the pig. And
               Bruno and Buffalmacco learning that he was gone to the farm, and
               that his wife was not with him, betook them to the house of a
               priest that was their especial friend and a neighbour of <span class="person">Calandrino</span>,
               there to tarry a while. Upon their arrival <span class="person">Calandrino</span>, who had
               that very morning killed the pig, met them with the priest, and
               accosted them, saying: A hearty welcome to you. I should
               	like you to see what an excellent manager I am; and so he took
               them into his house, and shewed them the pig. They observed
               that 'twas a very fine pig; and learned from <span class="person">Calandrino</span> that he was
               minded to salt it for household consumption. Then thou art but
               	a fool, quoth Bruno. Sell it, man, and let us have a jolly time
               	with the money; and tell thy wife that 'twas stolen. 
               Not I,
               replied <span class="person">Calandrino</span>: she would never believe me, and would drive
               	me out of the house. Urge me no further, for I will never do it.
               The others said a great deal more, but to no purpose; and <span class="person">Calandrino</span>
               bade them to supper, but so coldly that they declined, and left him.
            </p>
            <p>Presently: Should we not steal this pig from him to-night?
               quoth Bruno to Buffalmacco. 
               Could we so? returned Buffalmacco.
               How? 
               Why as to that, rejoined Bruno, I have
               	already marked how it may be done, if he bestow not the pig
               	elsewhere. 
               So be it, then, said Buffalmacco: we will steal
               	it; and then, perchance, our good host, Master Priest, will join us
               	in doing honour to such good cheer? 
               That right gladly will I,
               quoth the priest. Whereupon: Some address, though, quoth
               Bruno, will be needful: thou knowest, Buffalmacco, what a
               	niggardly fellow <span class="person">Calandrino</span> is, and how greedily he drinks at other
               	folk's expense. Go we, therefore, and take him to the tavern,
               	and there let the priest make as if, to do us honour, he would pay
               	the whole score, and suffer <span class="person">Calandrino</span> to pay never a soldo, and he
               	will grow tipsy, and then we shall speed excellent well, because he
               	is alone in the house.
            </p>
            <p>As Bruno proposed, so they did: and <span class="person">Calandrino</span>, finding that
               the priest would not suffer him to pay, drank amain, and took a great
               deal more aboard than he had need of; and the night being far spent
               when he left the tavern, he dispensed with supper, and went home,
               and thinking to have shut the door, got him to bed, leaving it open.
               Buffalmacco and Bruno went to sup with the priest; and after supper,
               taking with them certain implements with which to enter <span class="person">Calandrino</span>'s
               house, where Bruno thought it most feasible, they stealthily approached
               it; but finding the door open, they entered, and took down the pig,
               and carried it away to the priest's house, and having there bestowed
               it safely, went to bed. In the morning when <span class="person">Calandrino</span>, his head at
               length quit of the fumes of the wine, got up, and came downstairs
               and found that his pig was nowhere to be seen, and that the door
               was open, he asked this, that, and the other man, whether they wist
               who had taken the pig away, and getting no answer, he began to
               make a great outcry: Alas, alas! luckless man that I am, that
               	my pig should have been stolen from me! 
               Meanwhile Bruno and
               Buffalmacco, being also risen, made up to him, to hear what he would
               say touching the pig. Whom he no sooner saw, than well-nigh
               weeping he called them, saying: Alas! my friends! my pig is
               	stolen from me. 
               Bruno stepped up to him and said in a low tone:
               'Tis passing strange if thou art in the right for once. 
               Alas!
               returned <span class="person">Calandrino</span>, what I say is but too true. 
               Why, then,
               	out with it, man, quoth Bruno, cry aloud, that all folk may know
               	that 'tis so. 
               <span class="person">Calandrino</span> then raised his voice and said: By the
               	body o' God I say of a truth that my pig has been stolen from me.
               So! quoth Bruno, but publish it, man, publish it; lift up thy
               	voice, make thyself well heard, that all may believe thy report.
               Thou art enough to make me give my soul to the Enemy, replied
               <span class="person">Calandrino</span>. I say--dost not believe me?--that hang me by the
               	neck if the pig is not stolen from me! 
               Nay, but, quoth Bruno,
               how can it be? I saw it here but yesterday. Dost think to make
               	me believe that it has taken to itself wings and flown away? 
               All
               	the same 'tis as I tell thee, returned <span class="person">Calandrino</span>. 
               Is it possible? quoth Bruno. 
               Ay indeed, replied <span class="person">Calandrino</span>; 'tis even so: and
               	I am undone, and know not how to go home. Never will my wife
               	believe me; or if she do so, I shall know no peace this year.
               Upon my hope of salvation, quoth Bruno, 'tis indeed a bad
               	business, if so it really is. But thou knowest, <span class="person">Calandrino</span>, that 'twas
               	but yesterday I counselled thee to make believe that 'twas so. I
               	should be sorry to think thou didst befool thy wife and us at the same
               	time. 
               Ah! vociferated <span class="person">Calandrino</span>, wilt thou drive me to
               	despair and provoke me to blaspheme God and the saints and all the
               	company of heaven? I tell thee that the pig has been stolen from
               	me in the night. 
               Whereupon: If so it be, quoth Buffalmacco,
               we must find a way, if we can, to recover it. 
               Find a way?
               said <span class="person">Calandrino</span>: how can we compass that? 
               Why, replied
               Buffalmacco, 'tis certain that no one has come from <span class="place">India</span> to steal
               	thy pig: it must have been one of thy neighbours, and it thou
               	couldst bring them together, I warrant thee, I know how to make
               	the assay with bread and cheese, and we will find out in a trice who
               	has had the pig. 
               Ay, struck in Bruno, make thy assay with
               	bread
               	and cheese in the presence of these gentry hereabout, one of whom
               	I am sure has had the pig! why, the thing would be seen through:
               	and they would not come. 
               What shall we do, then? said
               Buffalmacco. 
               Whereto Bruno made answer: It must be done
               	with good pills of ginger and good vernaccia; and they must be
               	bidden come drink with us. They will suspect nothing, and will
               	come; and pills of ginger can be blessed just as well as bread and
               	cheese. 
               Beyond a doubt, thou art right, quoth Buffalmacco;
               and thou, <span class="person">Calandrino</span>, what sayst thou? Shall we do as Bruno
               	says? 
               Nay, I entreat you, for the love of God, quoth <span class="person">Calandrino</span>,
               do even so: for if I knew but who had had the pig, I should
               	feel myself half consoled for my loss. 
               Go to, now, quoth Bruno,
               I am willing to do thy errand to <span class="place">Florence</span> for these commodities, if
               	thou givest me the money.
            </p>
            <p><span class="person">Calandrino</span> had some forty soldi upon him, which he gave to
               Bruno, who thereupon hied him to <span class="place">Florence</span> to a friend of his that
               was an apothecary, and bought a pound of good pills of ginger, two
               of which, being of dog-ginger, he caused to be compounded with
               fresh hepatic aloes, and then to be coated with sugar like the others;
               and lest they should be lost, or any of the others mistaken for them,
               he had a slight mark set upon them by which he might readily
               recognize them. He also bought a flask of good vernaccia, and, thus
               laden, returned to the farm, and said to <span class="person">Calandrino</span>: 
               To-morrow
               	morning thou wilt bid those whom thou suspectest come hither to
               	drink with thee: as 'twill be a saint's day, they will all come readily
               	enough; and to-night I and Buffalmacco will say the incantation
               	over the pills, which in the morning I will bring to thee here, and
               	for our friendship's sake will administer them myself, and do and say
               	all that needs to be said and done. 
               So <span class="person">Calandrino</span> did as Bruno
               advised; and on the morrow a goodly company, as well of young
               men from <span class="place">Florence</span>, that happened to be in the village, as of husbandmen,
               being assembled in front of the church around the elm, Bruno
               and Buffalmacco came, bearing a box containing the ginger, and the
               flask of wine, and ranged the folk in a circle. Whereupon:
               
               Gentlemen, said Bruno, 'tis meet I tell you the reason why
               	you
               	are gathered here, that if aught unpleasant to you should befall, you
               	may have no ground for complaint against me. 
               	<span class="person">Calandrino</span> here was
               	the night before last robbed of a fine pig, and cannot discover who
               	has had it; and, for that it must have been stolen by some one of us
               	here, he would have each of you take and eat one of these pills and
               	drink of this vernaccia. Wherefore I forthwith do you to wit, that
               	whoso has had the pig will not be able to swallow the pill, but will
               	find it more bitter than poison, and will spit it out; and so, rather
               	than he should suffer this shame in presence of so many, 'twere
               	perhaps best that he that has had the pig should confess the fact to
               	the priest, and I will wash my hands of the affair.
            </p>
            <p>All professed themselves ready enough to eat the pills; and so,
               having set them in a row with <span class="person">Calandrino</span> among them, Bruno,
               beginning at one end, proceeded to give each a pill, and when he
               came to <span class="person">Calandrino</span> he chose one of the pills of dog-ginger and put it
               in his hand. <span class="person">Calandrino</span> thrust it forthwith between his teeth and
               began to chew it; but no sooner was his tongue acquainted with the
               aloes, than, finding the bitterness intolerable, he spat it out. 
               Now,
               the eyes of all the company being fixed on one another to see who should
               spit out his pill, Bruno, who, not having finished the distribution,
               feigned to be concerned with nought else, heard some one in his rear
               say: Ha! <span class="person">Calandrino</span>, what means this? and at once turning
               round, and marking that <span class="person">Calandrino</span> had spit out his pill: 
               Wait a
               while, quoth he, perchance 'twas somewhat else that caused thee
               to spit: take another; and thereupon whipping out the other pill of
               dog-ginger, he set it between <span class="person">Calandrino</span>'s teeth, and finished the
               distribution. Bitter as <span class="person">Calandrino</span> had found the former pill, he
               found this tenfold more so; but being ashamed to spit it out, he kept
               it a while in his mouth and chewed it, and, as he did so, tears stood in
               his eyes that shewed as large as filberts, and at length, being unable
               to bear it any longer, he spat it out, as he had its predecessor. 
               Which
               being observed by Buffalmacco and Bruno, who were then administering
               the wine, and by all the company, 'twas averred by common
               consent that <span class="person">Calandrino</span> had committed the theft himself; for which
               cause certain of them took him severely to task.
            </p>
            <p>However, the company being dispersed, and Bruno and Buffalmacco
               left alone with <span class="person">Calandrino</span>, Buffalmacco began on this wise:
               I never doubted but that thou hadst had it thyself, and wast minded
               to make us believe that it had been stolen from thee, that we might
               not have of thee so much as a single drink out of the price which
               thou gottest for it. 
               <span class="person">Calandrino</span>, with the bitterness of the aloes
               still on his tongue, fell a swearing that he had not had it. 
               Whereupon:
               Nay, but, comrade, quoth Buffalmacco, upon thy honour,
               what did it fetch? Six florins? 
               Whereto, <span class="person">Calandrino</span> being now
               on the verge of desperation, Bruno added: Now be reasonable,
               <span class="person">Calandrino</span>; among the company that ate and drank with us there
               was one that told me that thou hadst up there a girl that thou didst
               keep for thy pleasure, giving her what by hook or by crook thou
               couldst get together, and that he held it for certain that thou hadst
               sent her this pig. And thou art grown expert in this sort of cozenage.
               Thou tookest us one while adown the <span class="place">Mugnone</span> a gathering black
               stones, and having thus started us on a wild-goose chase, thou madest
               off; and then wouldst fain have us believe that thou hadst found the
               stone: and now, in like manner, thou thinkest by thine oaths to
               persuade us that this pig which thou hast given away or sold, has
               been stolen from thee. But we know thy tricks of old; never
               another couldst thou play us; and, to be round with thee, this spell
               has cost us some trouble: wherefore we mean that thou shalt give
               us two pair of capons, or we will let Monna Tessa know all. 
               Seeing
               that he was not believed, and deeming his mortification ample without
               the addition of his wife's resentment, <span class="person">Calandrino</span> gave them the
               two pair of capons, with which, when the pig was salted, they
               returned to <span class="place">Florence</span>, leaving <span class="person">Calandrino</span> with the loss and the laugh
               against him.

                  'tis only little wits that delight to scorn. In a series of stories we have heard

                  for a gentlewoman of our city (albeit the retribution that
                  came upon her was but just) whose flout was returned in the like
                  sort, and to such effect that she well-nigh died thereof. The which
                  to hear will not be unprofitable to you, for thereby you will learn to
                  be more careful how you flout others, and therein you will do very
                  wisely.

            </div>
            <p>'Tis not many years since there dwelt at <span class="place">Florence</span> a lady young
               and fair, and of a high spirit, as also of right gentle lineage, and
               tolerably well endowed with temporal goods. Now <span class="person">Elena</span>--such
               was the lady's name--being left a widow, was minded never to marry
               again, being enamoured of a handsome young gallant of her own
               choosing, with whom she, recking nought of any other lover, did, by
               the help of a maid in whom she placed much trust, not seldom speed
               the time gaily and with marvellous delight. Meanwhile it so befell
               that a young nobleman of our city, Rinieri by name, who had spent
               much time in study at <span class="place">Paris</span>, not that he might thereafter sell his
               knowledge by retail, but that he might learn the reasons and causes
               of things, which accomplishment shews to most excellent advantage
               in a gentleman, returned to <span class="place">Florence</span>, and there lived as a citizen in
               no small honour with his fellows, both by reason of his rank and of
               his learning. But as it is often the case that those who are most
               versed in deep matters are the soonest mastered by Love, so was it
               with Rinieri. For at a festal gathering, to which one day he went,
               there appeared before his eyes this <span class="person">Elena</span>, of whom we spoke, clad in
               black, as is the wont of our Florentine widows, and shewing to his
               mind so much fairer and more debonair than any other woman that
               he had ever seen, that happy indeed he deemed the man might call
               himself, to whom God in His goodness should grant the right to hold
               her naked in his arms. So now and again he eyed her stealthily, and
               knowing that boons goodly and precious are not to be gotten without
               trouble, he made up his mind to study and labour with all assiduity
               how best to please her, that so he might win her love, and thereby
               the enjoyment of her.
            </p>
            <p>The young gentlewoman was not used to keep her eyes bent
               ever towards the infernal regions; but, rating herself at no less, if not
               more, than her deserts, she was dexterous to move them to and fro,
               and thus busily scanning her company, soon detected the men who
               regarded her with pleasure. By which means having discovered
               Rinieri's passion, she inly laughed, and said: 'Twill turn out that
               'twas not for nothing that I came here to-day, for, if I mistake not,
               I have caught a gander by the bill. So she gave him an occasional
               sidelong glance, and sought as best she might to make him believe
               that she was not indifferent to him, deeming that the more men she
               might captivate by her charms, the higher those charms would be
               rated, and most especially by him whom she had made lord of them
               and her love. The erudite scholar bade adieu to philosophical meditation,
               for the lady entirely engrossed his mind; and, having discovered
               her house, he, thinking to please her, found divers pretexts
               for frequently passing by it. Whereon the lady, her vanity flattered
               for the reason aforesaid, plumed herself not a little, and shewed herself
               pleased to see him. Thus encouraged, the scholar found means to
               make friends with her maid, to whom he discovered his love, praying
               her to do her endeavour with her mistress, that he might have her
               favour. The maid was profuse of promises, and gave her mistress his
               message, which she no sooner heard, than she was convulsed with
               laughter, and replied: He brought sense enough hither from
               <span class="place">Paris</span>: knowest thou where he has since been to lose it? Go to,
               now; let us give him that which he seeks. Tell him, when he next
               speaks to you of the matter, that I love him vastly more than he
               loves me, but that I must have regard to my reputation, so that I
               may be able to hold my head up among other ladies; which, if he is
               really the wise man they say, will cause him to affect me much more.
               Ah! poor woman! poor woman! she little knew, my ladies, how
               rash it is to try conclusions with scholars.
            </p>
            <p>The maid found the scholar, and did her mistress's errand. 
               The
               scholar, overjoyed, proceeded to urge his suit with more ardour, to
               indite letters, and send presents. The lady received all that he sent
               her, but vouchsafed no answers save such as were couched in general
               terms: and on this wise she kept him dangling a long while. 
               At last,
               having disclosed the whole affair to her lover, who evinced some
               resentment and jealousy, she, to convince him that his suspicions
               were groundless, and for that she was much importuned by the
               scholar, sent word to him by her maid, that never since he had
               assured her of his love, had occasion served her to do him pleasure,
               but that next Christmastide she hoped to be with him; wherefore, if
               he were minded to await her in the courtyard of her house on the
               night of the day next following the feast, she would meet him there as
               soon as she could. Elated as ne'er another, the scholar hied him at
               the appointed time to the lady's house, and being ushered into a courtyard
               by the maid, who forthwith turned the key upon him, addressed
               himself there to await the lady's coming.
            </p>
            <p>Now the lady's lover, by her appointment, was with her that
               evening; and, when they had gaily supped, she told him what she had
               in hand that night, adding: And so thou wilt be able to gauge the
               love which I have borne and bear this scholar, whom thou hast
               foolishly regarded as a rival. 
               The lover heard the lady's words with
               no small delight, and waited in eager expectancy to see her make
               them good. The scholar, hanging about there in the courtyard,
               began to find it somewhat chillier than he would have liked, for it
               had snowed hard all day long, so that the snow lay everywhere
               thick on the ground; however, he bore it patiently, expecting to be
               recompensed by and by. 
               After a while the lady said to her lover:
               Go we to the chamber and take a peep through a lattice at him of
               whom thou art turned jealous, and mark what he does, and how he
               will answer the maid, whom I have bidden go speak with him. 
               So
               the pair hied them to a lattice, wherethrough they could see without
               being seen, and heard the maid call from another lattice to the
               scholar, saying: Rinieri, my lady is distressed as never woman
               was, for that one of her brothers is come here to-night, and after
               talking a long while with her, must needs sup with her, and is not
               yet gone, but, I think, he will soon be off; and that is the reason
               why she has not been able to come to thee, but she will come soon
               now. She trusts it does not irk thee to wait so long. 
               Whereto the
               scholar, supposing that 'twas true, made answer: Tell my lady to
               give herself no anxiety on my account, until she can conveniently
               come to me, but to do so as soon as she may. 
               Whereupon the maid
               withdrew from the window, and went to bed; while the lady said
               to her lover: Now, what sayst thou? Thinkst thou that, if I had
               that regard for him, which thou fearest, I would suffer him to tarry
               below there to get frozen? Which said, the lady and her now
               partly reassured lover got them to bed, where for a great while they
               disported them right gamesomely, laughing together and making
               merry over the luckless scholar.
            </p>
            <p>The scholar, meanwhile, paced up and down the courtyard to
               keep himself warm, nor indeed had he where to sit, or take shelter:
               in this plight he bestowed many a curse upon the lady's brother for
               his long tarrying, and never a sound did he hear but he thought that
               'twas the lady opening the door. But vain indeed were his hopes:
               the lady, having solaced herself with her lover until hard upon midnight,
               then said to him: How ratest thou our scholar, my soul?
               whether is the greater his wit, or the love I bear him, thinkst thou?
               Will the cold, that, of my ordaining, he now suffers, banish from thy
               breast the suspicion which my light words the other day implanted
               there? 
               Ay, indeed, heart of my body! replied the lover, well
               wot I now that even as thou art to me, my weal, my consolation,
               my bliss, so am I to thee. 
               So: quoth the lady, then I must
               have full a thousand kisses from thee, to prove that thou sayst
               sooth.
               The lover's answer was to strain her to his heart, and give her not
               merely a thousand but a hundred thousand kisses. 
               In such converse
               they dallied a while longer, and then: Get we up, now, quoth
               the lady, that we may go see if 'tis quite spent, that fire, with
               which, as he wrote to me daily, this new lover of mine used to
               burn. 
               So up they got and hied them to the lattice which they had
               used before, and peering out into the courtyard, saw the scholar
               dancing a hornpipe to the music that his own teeth made, a chattering
               for extremity of cold; nor had they ever seen it footed so nimbly
               and at such a pace. Whereupon: How sayst thou, sweet my
               hope? quoth the lady. Know I not how to make men dance
               without the aid of either trumpet or cornemuse? 
               Indeed thou
               dost, my heart's delight, replied the lover. Quoth then the lady:
               I have a mind that we go down to the door. Thou wilt keep
               quiet, and I will speak to him, and we shall hear what he says,
               which, peradventure, we shall find no less diverting than the sight
               of him.
            </p>
            <p>So they stole softly out of the chamber and down to the door,
               which leaving fast closed, the lady set her lips to a little hole that
               was there, and with a low voice called the scholar, who, hearing her
               call him, praised God, making too sure that he was to be admitted,
               and being come to the door, said: Here am I, Madam; open for
               God's sake; let me in, for I die of cold. 
               Oh! ay, replied the
               lady, I know thou hast a chill, and of course, there being a little
               snow about, 'tis mighty cold; but well I wot the nights are colder
               far at <span class="place">Paris</span>. I cannot let thee in as yet, because my accursed
               brother, that came to sup here this evening, is still with me; but he
               will soon take himself off, and then I will let thee in without a
               moment's delay. I have but now with no small difficulty given him
               the slip, to come and give thee heart that the waiting irk thee not.
               Nay but, Madam, replied the scholar, for the love of God, I
               entreat you, let me in, that I may have a roof over my head, because
               for some time past there has been never so thick a fall of snow, and
               'tis yet snowing; and then I will wait as long as you please.
               Alas! sweet my love, quoth the lady, that I may not, for this
               door makes such a din, when one opens it, that my brother would be
               sure to hear, were I to let thee in; but I will go tell him to get him
               gone, and so come back and admit thee. 
               Go at once, then,
               returned the scholar, and prithee, see that a good fire be kindled,
               that, when I get in, I may warm myself, for I am now so chilled
               through and through that I have scarce any feeling left. 
               That
               can scarce be, rejoined the lady, if it be true, what thou hast so
               protested in thy letters, that thou art all afire for love of me: 'tis
               plain to me now that thou didst but mock me. I now take my leave
               of thee: wait and be of good cheer.
            </p>
            <p>So the lady and her lover, who, to his immense delight, had heard
               all that passed, betook them to bed; however, little sleep had they
               that night, but spent the best part of it in disporting themselves and
               making merry over the unfortunate scholar, who, his teeth now
               chattering to such a tune that he seemed to have been metamorphosed
               into a stork, perceived that he had been befooled, and after making
               divers fruitless attempts to open the door and seeking means of egress
               to no better purpose, paced to and fro like a lion, cursing the villainous
               weather, the long night, his simplicity, and the perversity of the
               lady, against whom (the vehemence of his wrath suddenly converting
               the love he had so long borne her to bitter and remorseless enmity)
               he now plotted within himself divers and grand schemes of revenge,
               on which he was far more bent than ever he had been on forgathering
               with her.
            </p>
            <p>Slowly the night wore away, and with the first streaks of dawn
               the maid, by her mistress's direction, came down, opened the door of
               the courtyard, and putting on a compassionate air, greeted Rinieri
               with: Foul fall him that came here yestereve; he has afflicted us
               with his presence all night long, and has kept thee a freezing out
               here: but harkye, take it not amiss; that which might not be
               to-night shall be another time: well wot I that nought could have
               befallen that my lady could so ill brook. 
               For all his wrath, the
               scholar, witting, like the wise man he was, that menaces serve but to
               put the menaced on his guard, kept pent within his breast that which
               unbridled resentment would have uttered, and said quietly, and
               without betraying the least trace of anger: 
               In truth 'twas the
               worst night I ever spent, but I understood quite well that the lady
               was in no wise to blame, for that she herself, being moved to pity of
               me, came down here to make her excuses, and to comfort me; and,
               as thou sayst, what has not been to-night will be another time:
               wherefore commend me to her, and so, adieu! 
               Then, well-nigh
               paralysed for cold, he got him, as best he might, home, where, weary
               and fit to die for drowsiness, he threw himself on his bed, and fell
               into a deep sleep, from which he awoke to find that he had all but
               lost the use of his arms and legs. He therefore sent for some
               physicians, and having told them what a chill he had gotten, caused
               them have a care to his health. But, though they treated him with
               active and most drastic remedies, it cost them some time and no little
               trouble to restore to the cramped muscles their wonted pliancy, and,
               indeed, but for his youth and the milder weather that was at hand,
               'twould have gone very hard with him.
            </p>
            <p>However, recover he did his health and lustihood, and nursing
               his enmity, feigned to be vastly more enamoured of his widow than
               ever before. And so it was that after a while Fortune furnished him
               with an opportunity of satisfying his resentment, for the gallant of
               whom the widow was enamoured, utterly regardless of the love she
               bore him, grew enamoured of another lady, and was minded no more
               to pleasure the widow in aught either by word or by deed; wherefore
               she now pined in tears and bitterness of spirit. However, her
               maid, who commiserated her not a little, and knew not how to dispel
               the dumps that the loss of her lover had caused her, espying the
               scholar pass along the street, as he had been wont, conceived the
               silly idea that the lady's lover might be induced to return to his old
               love by some practice of a necromantic order, wherein she doubted
               not that the scholar must be a thorough adept; which idea she
               imparted to her mistress. The lady, being none too well furnished
               with sense, never thinking that, if the scholar had been an adept in
               necromancy, he would have made use of it in his own behoof, gave
               heed to what her maid said, and forthwith bade her learn of the
               scholar whether he would place his skill at her service, and assure
               him that, if he so did, she, in guerdon thereof, would do his pleasure.
               The maid did her mistress's errand well and faithfully. The scholar
               no sooner heard the message, than he said to himself: Praised be
               Thy name, O God, that the time is now come, when with Thy
               help I may be avenged upon this wicked woman of the wrong she
               did me in requital of the great love I bore her. Then, turning to
               the maid, he said: Tell my lady to set her mind at ease touching
               this matter; for that, were her lover in <span class="place">India</span>, I would forthwith
               bring him hither to crave her pardon of that wherein he has offended
               her. As to the course she should take in the matter, I tarry but her
               pleasure to make it known to her, when and where she may think
               fit: tell her so, and bid her from me to be of good cheer. The
               maid carried his answer to her mistress, and arranged that they should
               meet in the church of <span class="place">Santa Lucia of Prato</span>. Thither accordingly
               they came, the lady and the scholar, and conversed apart, and the
               lady, quite oblivious of the ill-usage by which she had well-nigh done
               him to death, opened all her mind to him, and besought him, if he had
               any regard to her welfare, to aid her to the attainment of her desire.
               Madam, replied the scholar, true it is that among other lore
               that I acquired at <span class="place">Paris</span> was this of necromancy, whereof, indeed, I
               know all that may be known; but, as 'tis in the last degree displeasing
               to God, I had sworn never to practise it either for my own or for any
               other's behoof. 'Tis also true that the love I bear you is such that I
               know not how to refuse you aught that you would have me do for
               you; and so, were this single essay enough to consign me to hell,
               I would adventure it to pleasure you. But I mind me that 'tis a
               matter scarce so easy of performance as, perchance, you suppose,
               most especially when a woman would fain recover the love of a man,
               or a man that of a woman, for then it must be done by the postulant
               in proper person, and at night, and in lonely places, and unattended,
               so that it needs a stout heart; nor know I whether you are disposed
               to comply with these conditions. The lady, too enamoured to be
               discreet, made answer: So shrewdly does Love goad me, that
               there is nought I would not do to bring him back to me who wrongfully
               has deserted me; but tell me, prithee, wherein it is that I have
               need of this stout heart. 
               Madam, returned the despiteful scholar,
               'twill be my part to fashion in tin an image of him you would fain
               lure back to you: and when I have sent you the image, 'twill be for
               you, when the moon is well on the wane, to dip yourself, being stark
               naked, and the image, seven times in a flowing stream, and this you
               must do quite alone about the hour of first sleep, and afterwards, still
               naked, you must get you upon some tree or some deserted house, and
               facing the North, with the image in your hand, say certain words
               that I shall give you in writing seven times; which, when you have
               done, there will come to you two damsels, the fairest you ever saw,
               who will greet you graciously, and ask of you what you would fain
               have; to whom you will disclose frankly and fully all that you
               crave; and see to it that you make no mistake in the name; and
               when you have said all, they will depart, and you may then descend
               and return to the spot where you left your clothes, and resume them,
               and go home. And rest assured, that before the ensuing midnight
               your lover will come to you in tears, and crave your pardon and
               mercy, and that thenceforth he will never again desert you for any
               other woman.
            </p>
            <p>The lady gave entire credence to the scholar's words, and deeming
               her lover as good as in her arms again, recovered half her wonted
               spirits: wherefore: Make no doubt, quoth she, that I shall do
               as thou biddest; and indeed I am most favoured by circumstance;
               for in upper Val d'<span class="place">Arno</span> I have an estate adjoining the river, and 'tis
               now July, so that to bathe will be delightful. Ay, and now I mind
               me that at no great distance from the river there is a little tower,
               which is deserted, save that now and again the shepherds will get
               them up by the chestnut-wood ladder to the roof, thence to look out
               for their strayed sheep; 'tis a place lonely indeed, and quite out of
               ken; and when I have clomb it, as climb it I will, I doubt not 'twill
               be the best place in all the world to give effect to your
               instructions.
            </p>
            <p>Well pleased to be certified of the lady's intention, the scholar,
               to whom her estate and the tower were very well known, made
               answer: I was never in those parts, Madam, and therefore know
               neither your estate nor the tower, but, if 'tis as you say, 'twill certainly
               be the best place in the world for your purpose. So, when
               time shall serve, I will send you the image and the orison. But I
               pray you, when you shall have your heart's desire, and know that
               I have done you good service, do not forget me, but keep your
               promise to me. That will I without fail, quoth the lady; and
               so she bade him farewell, and went home. The scholar, gleefully
               anticipating the success of his enterprise, fashioned an image, and
               inscribed it with certain magical signs, and wrote some gibberish
               by way of orison, which in due time he sent to the lady, bidding her
               the very next night do as he had prescribed: and thereupon he
               hied him privily with one of his servants to the house of a friend
               hard by the tower, there to carry his purpose into effect. The lady,
               on her part, set out with her maid, and betook her to her estate, and,
               night being come, sent the maid to bed, as if she were minded to go
               to rest herself; and about the hour of first sleep stole out of the
               house and down to the tower, beside the <span class="place">Arno</span>; and when, having
               carefully looked about her, she was satisfied that never a soul was to
               be seen or heard, she took off her clothes and hid them under a bush;
               then, with the image in her hand, she dipped herself seven times in
               the river; which done, she hied her with the image to the tower.
               The scholar, having at nightfall couched himself with his servant
               among the willows and other trees that fringed the bank, marked
               all that she did, and how, as she passed by him, the whiteness of her
               flesh dispelled the shades of night, and scanning attentively her
               bosom and every other part of her body, and finding them very fair,
               felt, as he bethought him what would shortly befall them, some pity
               of her; while, on the other hand, he was suddenly assailed by the
               solicitations of the flesh which caused that to stand which had been
               inert, and prompted him to sally forth of his ambush and take her by
               force, and have his pleasure of her. And, what with his compassion
               and passion, he was like to be worsted; but then, as he bethought
               him who he was, and what a grievous wrong had been done him,
               and for what cause, and by whom, his wrath, thus rekindled, got the
               better of the other affections, so that he swerved not from his resolve,
               but suffered her to go her way.
            </p>
            <p>The lady ascended the tower, and standing with her face to the
               North, began to recite the scholar's orison, while he, having stolen
               into the tower but a little behind her, cautiously shifted the ladder
               that led up to the roof on which the lady stood, and waited to
               observe what she would say and do. Seven times the lady said the
               orison, and then awaited the appearance of the two damsels; and so
               long had she to wait--not to mention that the night was a good deal
               cooler than she would have liked--that she saw day break; whereupon,
               disconcerted that it had not fallen out as the scholar had
               promised, she said to herself: I misdoubt me he was minded to
               give me such a night as I gave him; but if such was his intent, he
               is but maladroit in his revenge, for this night is not as long by a third
               as his was, besides which, the cold is of another quality. And that
               day might not overtake her there, she began to think of descending,
               but, finding that the ladder was removed, she felt as if the world had
               come to nought beneath her feet, her senses reeled, and she fell in a
               swoon upon the floor of the roof. When she came to herself, she
               burst into tears and piteous lamentations, and witting now very well
               that 'twas the doing of the scholar, she began to repent her that she
               had first offended him, and then trusted him unduly, having such
               good cause to reckon upon his enmity; in which frame she abode
               long time. Then, searching if haply she might find some means of
               descent, and finding none, she fell a weeping again, and bitterly to
               herself she said: Alas for thee, wretched woman! what will thy
               brothers, thy kinsmen, thy neighbours, nay, what will all <span class="place">Florence</span>
               say of thee, when 'tis known that thou hast been found here naked?
               Thy honour, hitherto unsuspect, will be known to have been but
               a shew, and shouldst thou seek thy defence in lying excuses, if any
               such may be fashioned, the accursed scholar, who knows all thy
               doings, will not suffer it. Ah! poor wretch! that at one and the
               same time hast lost thy too dearly cherished gallant and thine own
               honour! And therewith she was taken with such a transport of
               grief, that she was like to cast herself from the tower to the ground.
               Then, bethinking her that if she might espy some lad making towards
               the tower with his sheep, she might send him for her maid, for the
               sun was now risen, she approached one of the parapets of the tower,
               and looked out, and so it befell that the scholar, awakening from a
               slumber, in which he had lain a while at the foot of a bush, espied
               her, and she him. Whereupon: Good-day, Madam, quoth he:
               are the damsels yet come? The lady saw and heard him not
               without bursting afresh into a flood of tears, and besought him to
               come into the tower, that she might speak with him: a request which
               the scholar very courteously granted. The lady then threw herself
               prone on the floor of the roof; and, only her head being visible
               through the aperture, thus through her sobs she spoke: Verily,
               Rinieri, if I gave thee a bad night, thou art well avenged on me, for,
               though it be July, meseemed I was sore a cold last night, standing
               here with never a thread upon me, and, besides, I have so bitterly
               bewept both the trick I played thee and my own folly in trusting
               thee, that I marvel that I have still eyes in my head. Wherefore
               I implore thee, not for love of me, whom thou hast no cause to love,
               but for the respect thou hast for thyself as a gentleman, that thou let
               that which thou hast already done suffice thee to avenge the wrong
               I did thee, and bring me my clothes, that I may be able to get me
               down from here, and spare to take from me that which, however
               thou mightst hereafter wish, thou couldst not restore to me, to wit,
               my honour; whereas, if I deprived thee of that one night with me,
               'tis in my power to give thee many another night in recompense
               thereof, and thou hast but to choose thine own times. Let this,
               then, suffice, and like a worthy gentleman be satisfied to have taken
               thy revenge, and to have let me know it: put not forth thy might
               against a woman: 'tis no glory to the eagle to have vanquished a
               dove; wherefore for God's and thine own honour's sake have mercy
               on me.
            </p>
            <p>The scholar, albeit his haughty spirit still brooded on her evil
               entreatment of him, yet saw her not weep and supplicate without
               a certain compunction mingling with his exultation; but vengeance
               he had desired above all things, to have wreaked it was indeed sweet,
               and albeit his humanity prompted him to have compassion on the
               hapless woman, yet it availed not to subdue the fierceness of his
               resentment; wherefore thus he made answer: 
               Madam <span class="person">Elena</span>,
               had my prayers (albeit art I had none to mingle with them tears
               and honeyed words as thou dost with thine) inclined thee that night,
               when I stood perishing with cold amid the snow that filled thy
               courtyard, to accord me the very least shelter, 'twere but a light
               matter for me to hearken now to thine; but, if thou art now so
               much more careful of thy honour than thou wast wont to be, and
               it irks thee to tarry there naked, address thy prayers to him in whose
               arms it irked thee not naked to pass that night thou mindest thee
               of, albeit thou wist that I with hasty foot was beating time upon
               the snow in thy courtyard to the accompaniment of chattering
               teeth: 'tis he that thou shouldst call to succour thee, to fetch thy
               clothes, to adjust the ladder for thy descent; 'tis he in whom thou
               shouldst labour to inspire this tenderness thou now shewest for thy
               honour, that honour which for his sake thou hast not scrupled to
               jeopardize both now and on a thousand other occasions. Why,
               then, call'st thou not him to come to thy succour? To whom
               pertains it rather than to him? Thou art his. And of whom will
               he have a care, whom will he succour, if not thee? Thou askedst
               him that night, when thou wast wantoning with him, whether
               seemed to him the greater, my folly or the love thou didst bear
               him: call him now, foolish woman, and see if the love thou bearest
               him, and thy wit and his, may avail to deliver thee from my folly.
               
               'Tis now no longer in thy power to shew me courtesy of that which
               I no more desire, nor yet to refuse it, did I desire it. Reserve thy
               nights for thy lover, if so be thou go hence alive. Be they all thine
               and his. One of them was more than I cared for; 'tis enough for
               me to have been flouted once. Ay, and by thy cunning of speech
               thou strivest might and main to conciliate my good-will, calling me
               worthy gentleman, by which insinuation thou wouldst fain induce
               me magnanimously to desist from further chastisement of thy baseness.
               But thy cajoleries shall not now cloud the eyes of my mind,
               as did once thy false promises. I know myself, and better now for
               thy one night's instruction than for all the time I spent at <span class="place">Paris</span>.
               But, granted that I were disposed to be magnanimous, thou art not
               of those to whom 'tis meet to shew magnanimity. A wild beast
               such as thou, having merited vengeance, can claim no relief
               from suffering save death, though in the case of a human being
               'twould suffice to temper vengeance with mercy, as thou saidst.
               Wherefore I, albeit no eagle, witting thee to be no dove, but a
               venomous serpent, mankind's most ancient enemy, am minded,
               bating no jot of malice or of might, to harry thee to the bitter end:
               natheless this which I do is not properly to be called vengeance but
               rather just retribution; seeing that vengeance should be in excess
               of the offence, and this my chastisement of thee will fall short of
               it; for, were I minded to be avenged on thee, considering what
               account thou madest of my heart and soul, 'twould not suffice me
               to take thy life, no, nor the lives of a hundred others such as thee;
               for I should but slay a vile and base and wicked woman. 
               And
               what the Devil art thou more than any other pitiful baggage, that
               I should spare thy little store of beauty, which a few years will
               ruin, covering thy face with wrinkles? And yet 'twas not for
               want of will that thou didst fail to do to death a worthy gentleman,
               as thou but now didst call me, of whom in a single day of his life
               the world may well have more profit than of a hundred thousand
               like thee while the world shall last. Wherefore by this rude
               discipline I will teach thee what it is to flout men of spirit, and
               more especially what it is to flout scholars, that if thou escape with
               thy life thou mayst have good cause ever hereafter to shun such
               folly. But if thou art so fain to make the descent, why cast not
               thyself down, whereby, God helping, thou wouldst at once
               break thy neck, be quit of the torment thou endurest, and make
               me the happiest man alive? I have no more to say to thee. 'Twas
               my art and craft thus caused thee climb; be it thine to find the
               way down: thou hadst cunning enough, when thou wast minded
               to flout me.
            </p>
            <p>While the scholar thus spoke, the hapless lady wept incessantly,
               and before he had done, to aggravate her misery, the sun was high
               in the heaven. However, when he was silent, thus she made
               answer: Ah! ruthless man, if that accursed night has so rankled
               with thee, and thou deemest my fault so grave that neither my youth
               and beauty, nor my bitter tears, nor yet my humble supplications may
               move thee to pity, let this at least move thee, and abate somewhat
               of thy remorseless severity, that 'twas my act alone, in that of late
               I trusted thee, and discovered to thee all my secret, that did open
               the way to compass thy end, and make me cognizant of my guilt,
               seeing that, had I not confided in thee, on no wise mightst thou
               have been avenged on me; which thou wouldst seem so ardently
               to have desired. Turn thee, then, turn thee, I pray thee, from thy
               wrath, and pardon me. So thou wilt pardon me, and get me down
               hence, right gladly will I give up for ever my faithless gallant, and
               thou shalt be my sole lover and lord, albeit thou sayst hard things
               of my beauty, slight and shortlived as thou wouldst have it to be,
               which, however it may compare with others, is, I wot, to be prized,
               if for no other reason, yet for this, that 'tis the admiration
               and solace and delight of young men, and thou art not yet old.
               And albeit I have been harshly treated by thee, yet believe I cannot
               that thou wouldst have me do myself so shamefully to death as to
               cast me down, like some abandoned wretch, before thine eyes, in
               which, unless thou wast then, as thou hast since shewn thyself, a
               liar, I found such favour. Ah! have pity on me for God's and
               mercy's sake! The sun waxes exceeding hot, and having suffered
               not a little by the cold of last night, I now begin to be sorely afflicted
               by the heat.
            </p>
            <p>Madam, rejoined the scholar, who held her in parley with no
               small delight, 'twas not for any love that thou didst bear me that
               thou trustedst me, but that thou mightst recover that which thou
               hadst lost, for which cause thou meritest but the greater punishment;
               and foolish indeed art thou if thou supposest that such was the sole
               means available for my revenge. I had a thousand others, and, while
               I feigned to love thee, I had laid a thousand gins for thy feet, into
               one or other of which in no long time, though this had not occurred,
               thou must needs have fallen, and that too to thy more grievous
               suffering and shame; nor was it to spare thee, but that I might be
               the sooner rejoiced by thy discomfiture that I took my present
               course. And though all other means had failed me, I had still the
               pen, with which I would have written of thee such matters and in
               such a sort, that when thou wist them, as thou shouldst have done,
               thou wouldst have regretted a thousand times that thou hadst ever
               been born. The might of the pen is greater far than they suppose,
               who have not proved it by experience. By God I swear,
               so may He, who has prospered me thus far in this my revenge,
               prosper me to the end! that I would have written of thee things
               that would have so shamed thee in thine own--not to speak of
               others'--sight that thou hadst put out thine eyes that thou mightst
               no more see thyself; wherefore chide not the sea, for that it has
               sent forth a tiny rivulet. For thy love, or whether thou be mine or
               no, nought care I. Be thou still his, whose thou hast been, if thou
               canst. Hate him as I once did, I now love him, by reason of his
               present entreatment of thee. Ye go getting you enamoured, ye
               women, and nought will satisfy you but young gallants, because ye
               mark that their flesh is ruddier, and their beards are blacker, than other
               folk's, and that they carry themselves well, and foot it featly in the
               dance, and joust; but those that are now more mature were even as
               they, and possess a knowledge which they have yet to acquire. And
               therewithal ye deem that they ride better, and cover more miles in a
               day, than men of riper age. Now that they dust the pelisse with
               more vigour I certainly allow, but their seniors, being more experienced,
               know better the places where the fleas lurk; and spare and
               dainty diet is preferable to abundance without savour: moreover
               hard trotting will gall and jade even the youngest, whereas an easy
               pace, though it bring one somewhat later to the inn, at any rate
               brings one thither fresh. Ye discern not, witless creatures that ye
               are, how much of evil this little shew of bravery serves to hide.
               Your young gallant is never content with one woman, but lusts
               after as many as he sets eyes on; nor is there any but he deems
               himself worthy of her: wherefore 'tis not possible that their love
               should be lasting, as thou hast but now proved and mayst only too
               truly witness. Moreover to be worshipped, to be caressed by their
               ladies they deem but their due; nor is there aught whereon they
               plume and boast them so proudly as their conquests: which impertinence
               has caused not a few women to surrender to the friars, who
               keep their own counsel. Peradventure thou wilt say that never a
               soul save thy maid and I wist aught of thy loves; but, if so, thou
               hast been misinformed, and if thou so believest, thou dost misbelieve.
               Scarce aught else is talked of either in his quarter or in thine; but
               most often 'tis those most concerned whose ears such matters reach
               last. Moreover, they rob you, these young gallants, whereas the
               others make you presents. So, then, having made a bad choice, be
               thou still his to whom thou hast given thyself, and leave me, whom
               thou didst flout, to another, for I have found a lady of much greater
               charms than thine, and that has understood me better than thou
               didst. And that thou mayst get thee to the other world better
               certified of the desire of my eyes than thou wouldst seem to be here
               by my words, delay no more, but cast thyself down, whereby thy
               soul, taken forthwith, as I doubt not she will be, into the embrace
               of the Devil, may see whether thy headlong fall afflicts mine eyes, or
               no. But, for that I doubt thou meanest not thus to gladden me,
               I bid thee, if thou findest the sun begin to scorch thee, remember the
               cold thou didst cause me to endure, wherewith, by admixture, thou
               mayst readily temper the sun's heat.
            </p>
            <p>The hapless lady, seeing that the scholar's words were ever to the
               same ruthless effect, burst afresh into tears, and said: Lo, now,
               since nought that pertains to me may move thee, be thou at least
               moved by the love thou bearest this lady of whom thou speakest, who,
               thou sayst, is wiser than I, and loves thee, and for love of her pardon me,
               and fetch me my clothes, that I may resume them, and get me down
               hence. 
               Whereat the scholar fell a laughing, and seeing that 'twas
               not a little past tierce, made answer: Lo, now, I know not how
               to deny thee, adjuring me as thou dost by such a lady: tell me, then,
               where thy clothes are, and I will go fetch them, and bring thee
               down. 
               The lady, believing him, was somewhat comforted, and
               told him where she had laid her clothes. The scholar then quitted
               the tower, bidding his servant on no account to stir from his post,
               but to keep close by, and, as best he might, bar the tower against all
               comers until his return: which said, he betook him to the house of
               his friend, where he breakfasted much at his ease, and thereafter
               went to sleep. 
               Left alone upon the tower, the lady, somewhat
               cheered by her fond hope, but still exceeding sorrowful, drew nigh
               to a part of the wall where there was a little shade, and there sate
               down to wait. And now lost in most melancholy brooding, now
               dissolved in tears, now plunged in despair of ever seeing the scholar
               return with her clothes, but never more than a brief while in any one
               mood, spent with grief and the night's vigil, she by and by fell asleep.
               The sun was now in the zenith, and smote with extreme fervour
               full and unmitigated upon her tender and delicate frame, and upon
               her bare head, insomuch that his rays did not only scorch but bit by
               bit excoriate every part of her flesh that was exposed to them, and so
               shrewdly burn her that, albeit she was in a deep sleep, the pain
               awoke her. And as by reason thereof she writhed a little, she felt
               the scorched skin part in sunder and shed itself, as will happen when
               one tugs at a parchment that has been singed by the fire, while her
               head ached so sore that it seemed like to split, and no wonder. Nor
               might she find place either to lie or to stand on the floor of the roof,
               but ever went to and fro, weeping. Besides which there stirred not
               the least breath of wind, and flies and gadflies did swarm in prodigious
               quantity, which, settling upon her excoriate flesh, stung her so shrewdly
               that 'twas as if she received so many stabs with a javelin, and she was
               ever restlessly feeling her sores with her hands, and cursing herself,
               her life, her lover, and the scholar.
            </p>
            <p>Thus by the exorbitant heat of the sun, by the flies and gadflies,
               harassed, goaded, and lacerated, tormented also by hunger, and yet
               more by thirst, and thereto by a thousand distressful thoughts, she
               planted herself erect on her feet, and looked about her, if haply she
               might see or hear any one, with intent, come what might, to call
               to him and crave his succour. But even this hostile Fortune had
               disallowed her. The husbandmen were all gone from the fields by
               reason of the heat, and indeed there had come none to work that
               day in the neighbourhood of the tower, for that all were employed in
               threshing their corn beside their cottages: wherefore she heard but
               the cicalas, while <span class="place">Arno</span>, tantalizing her with the sight of his waters,
               increased rather than diminished her thirst. Ay, and in like manner,
               wherever she espied a copse, or a patch of shade, or a house, 'twas a
               torment to her, for the longing she had for it. 
               What more is to be
               said of this hapless woman? Only this: that what with the heat of
               the sun above and the floor beneath her, and the scarification of her
               flesh in every part by the flies and gadflies, that flesh, which in the
               night had dispelled the gloom by its whiteness, was now become red
               as madder, and so besprent with clots of blood, that whoso had seen
               her would have deemed her the most hideous object in the world.
            </p>
            <p>Thus resourceless and hopeless, she passed the long hours, expecting
               death rather than aught else, until half none was come and gone;
               when, his siesta ended, the scholar bethought him of his lady, and
               being minded to see how she fared, hied him back to the tower, and
               sent his servant away to break his fast. As soon as the lady espied
               him, she came, spent and crushed by her sore affliction, to the aperture,
               and thus addressed him: 
               Rinieri, the cup of thy vengeance
               is full to overflowing: for if I gave thee a night of freezing in my
               courtyard, thou hast given me upon this tower a day of scorching,
               nay, of burning, and therewithal of perishing of hunger and thirst:
               wherefore, by God I entreat thee to come up hither, and as my heart
               fails me to take my life, take it thou, for 'tis death I desire of all
               things, such and so grievous is my suffering. 
               But if this grace thou
               wilt not grant, at least bring me a cup of water wherewith to lave
               my mouth, for which my tears do not suffice, so parched and torrid is
               it within. 
               Well wist the scholar by her voice how spent she was;
               he also saw a part of her body burned through and through by the
               sun; whereby, and by reason of the lowliness of her entreaties, he
               felt some little pity for her; but all the same he made answer:
               Nay, wicked woman, 'tis not by my hands thou shalt die; thou
               canst die by thine own whenever thou art so minded; and to temper
               thy heat thou shalt have just as much water from me as I had fire
               from thee to mitigate my cold. I only regret that for the cure of
               my chill the physicians were fain to use foul-smelling muck, whereas
               thy burns can be treated with fragrant rose-water; and that, whereas
               I was like to lose my muscles and the use of my limbs, thou, for all
               thy excoriation by the heat, wilt yet be fair again, like a snake that
               has sloughed off the old skin. 
               Alas! woe's me! replied the
               lady, for charms acquired at such a cost, God grant them to those
               that hate me. But thou, most fell of all wild beasts, how hast thou
               borne thus to torture me? What more had I to expect of thee or
               any other, had I done all thy kith and kin to death with direst
               torments? Verily, I know not what more cruel suffering thou
               couldst have inflicted on a traitor that had put a whole city to the
               slaughter than this which thou hast allotted to me, to be thus roasted,
               and devoured of the flies, and therewithal to refuse me even a cup of
               water, though the very murderers condemned to death by the law,
               as they go to execution, not seldom are allowed wine to drink, so they
               but ask it. 
               Lo now, I see that thou art inexorable in thy ruthlessness,
               and on no wise to be moved by my suffering: wherefore with
               resignation I will compose me to await death, that God may have
               mercy on my soul. And may this that thou doest escape not the
               searching glance of His just eyes. 
               Which said, she dragged herself,
               sore suffering, toward the middle of the floor, despairing of ever
               escaping from her fiery torment, besides which, not once only, but a
               thousand times she thought to choke for thirst, and ever she wept
               bitterly and bewailed her evil fate. 
               But at length the day wore to
               vespers, and the scholar, being sated with his revenge, caused his
               servant to take her clothes and wrap them in his cloak, and hied him
               with the servant to the hapless lady's house, where, finding her maid
               sitting disconsolate and woebegone and resourceless at the door:
               Good woman, quoth he, what has befallen thy mistress?
               Whereto: Sir, I know not, replied the maid. I looked to find
               her this morning abed, for methought she went to bed last night,
               but neither there nor anywhere else could I find her, nor know I
               what is become of her; wherefore exceeding great is my distress;
               but have you, Sir, nought to say of the matter? 
               Only this,
               returned the scholar, that I would I had had thee with her there
               where I have had her, that I might have requited thee of thy offence,
               even as I have requited her of hers. But be assured that thou shalt
               not escape my hands, until thou hast from me such wage of thy
               labour that thou shalt never flout man more, but thou shalt mind
               thee of me. Then, turning to his servant, he said: Give her
               these clothes, and tell her that she may go bring her mistress away,
               if she will. 
               The servant did his bidding; and the maid, what
               with the message and her recognition of the clothes, was mightily
               afraid, lest they had slain the lady, and scarce suppressing a shriek,
               took the clothes, and, bursting into tears, set off, as soon as the
               scholar was gone, at a run for the tower.
            </p>
            <p>Now one of the lady's husbandmen had had the misfortune to
               lose two of his hogs that day, and, seeking them, came to the tower
               not long after the scholar had gone thence, and peering about in all
               quarters, if haply he might have sight of his hogs, heard the woeful
               lamentation that the hapless lady made, and got him up into the
               tower, and called out as loud as he might: Who wails up there?
               The lady recognized her husbandman's voice, and called him by
               name, saying: Prithee, go fetch my maid, and cause her come
               up hither to me. The husbandman, knowing her by her voice,
               replied: Alas! Madam, who set you there? Your maid has
               been seeking you all day long: but who would ever have supposed
               that you were there? 
               Whereupon he took the props of the ladder,
               and set them in position, and proceeded to secure the rounds to
               them with withies. Thus engaged he was found by the maid, who,
               as she entered the tower, beat her face and breast, and unable longer
               to keep silence, cried out: Alas, sweet my lady, where are you?
               Whereto the lady made answer as loud as she might: O my sister,
               here above am I, weep not, but fetch me my clothes forthwith. 
               Well-nigh
               restored to heart, to hear her mistress's voice, the maid, assisted
               by the husbandman, ascended the ladder, which he had now all but
               set in order, and gaining the roof, and seeing her lady lie there
               naked, spent and fordone, and liker to a half-burned stump than to a
               human being, she planted her nails in her face and fell a weeping
               over her, as if she were a corpse. 
               However, the lady bade her for
               God's sake be silent, and help her to dress, and having learned from
               her that none knew where she had been, save those that had brought
               her her clothes and the husbandman that was there present, was
               somewhat consoled, and besought her for God's sake to say nought
               of the matter to any. 
               Thus long time they conversed, and then
               the husbandman took the lady on his shoulders, for walk she could
               not, and bore her safely out of the tower. The unfortunate maid,
               following after with somewhat less caution, slipped, and falling from
               the ladder to the ground, broke her thigh, and roared for pain like
               any lion. 
               So the husbandman set the lady down upon a grassy mead,
               while he went to see what had befallen the maid, whom, finding her
               thigh broken, he brought, and laid beside the lady: who, seeing her
               woes completed by this last misfortune, and that she of whom, most
               of all, she had expected succour, was lamed of a thigh, was distressed
               beyond measure, and wept again so piteously that not only was the
               husbandman powerless to comfort her, but was himself fain to weep.
               However, as the sun was now low, that they might not be there
               surprised by night, he, with the disconsolate lady's approval, hied him
               home, and called to his aid two of his brothers and his wife, who
               returned with him, bearing a plank, whereon they laid the maid, and
               so they carried her to the lady's house. There, by dint of cold
               water and words of cheer, they restored some heart to the lady,
               whom the husbandman then took upon his shoulders, and bore to her
               chamber. The husbandman's wife fed her with sops of bread, and
               then undressed her, and put her to bed. They also provided the
               means to carry her and the maid to <span class="place">Florence</span>; and so 'twas done.
               There the lady, who was very fertile in artifices, invented an entirely
               fictitious story of what had happened as well in regard of her maid
               as of herself, whereby she persuaded both her brothers and her sisters
               and every one else, that 'twas all due to the enchantments of evil
               spirits. The physicians lost no time, and, albeit the lady's suffering
               and mortification were extreme, for she left more than one skin sticking
               to the sheets, they cured her of a high fever, and certain attendant
               maladies; as also the maid of her fractured thigh. The end of all
               which was that the lady forgot her lover, and having learned discretion,
               was thenceforth careful neither to love nor to flout; and the
               scholar, learning that the maid had broken her thigh, deemed his
               vengeance complete, and was satisfied to say never a word more of
               the affair. Such then were the consequences of her flouts to this
               foolish young woman, who deemed that she might trifle with a
               scholar with the like impunity as with others, not duly understanding
               that they--I say not all, but the more part--know where the Devil
               keeps his tail.I.e. are a match for the Devil himself in
               cunning. Wherefore, my ladies, have a care how you flout
               men, and more especially scholars.

            <p>You are to know, then, that at <span class="place">Siena</span>,
               as I have heard tell, there dwelt two young men of good substance,
               and, for plebeians, of good family, the one Spinelloccio Tanena, the
               other Zeppa di Mino, by name; who, their houses being contiguous
               in the <span class="place">Camollia</span>,A suburb of <span class="place">Siena</span>. kept ever together, and, by
               what appeared, loved
               each other as brothers, or even more so, and had each a very fine
               woman to wife. Now it so befell that Spinelloccio, being much in
               Zeppa's house, as well when Zeppa was not, as when he was there,
               grew so familiar with Zeppa's wife, that he sometimes lay with her;
               and on this wise they continued to forgather a great while before any
               one was ware of it. However, one of these days Zeppa being at
               home, though the lady wist it not, Spinelloccio came in quest of
               him; and, the lady sending word that he was not at home, he forthwith
               went upstairs and found the lady in the saloon, and seeing none
               else there, kissed her, as did she him.
            </p>
            <p>Zeppa saw all that passed, but said nothing and kept close, being
               minded to see how the game would end, and soon saw his wife and
               Spinelloccio, still in one another's arms, hie them to her chamber and
               lock themselves in: whereat he was mightily incensed. But, witting
               that to make a noise, or do aught else overt, would not lessen but
               rather increase his dishonour, he cast about how he might be avenged
               on such wise that, without the affair getting wind, he might content
               his soul; and having, after long pondering, hit, as he thought, upon
               the expedient, he budged not from his retreat, until Spinelloccio had
               parted from the lady. Whereupon he hied him into the chamber,
               and there finding the lady with her head-gear, which Spinelloccio in
               toying with her had disarranged, scarce yet readjusted: Madam,
               what dost thou? quoth he. Whereto: Why, dost not see?
               returned the lady. 
               Troth do I, rejoined he, and somewhat else
               have I seen that I would I had not. And so he questioned her of
               what had passed, and she, being mightily afraid, did after long parley
               confess that which she might not plausibly deny, to wit, her intimacy
               with Spinelloccio, and fell a beseeching him with tears to pardon her.
               Lo, now, wife, quoth Zeppa, thou hast done wrong, and, so thou
               wouldst have me pardon thee, have a care to do exactly as I shall bid
               thee; to wit, on this wise: 
               thou must tell Spinelloccio to find some
               occasion to part from me to-morrow morning about tierce, and come
               hither to thee; and while he is here I will come back, and when
               thou hearest me coming, thou wilt get him into this chest, and lock
               him in there; which when thou hast done, I will tell thee what else
               thou hast to do, which thou mayst do without the least misgiving,
               for I promise thee I will do him no harm. The lady, to content
               him, promised to do as he bade, and she kept her word.
            </p>
            <p>The morrow came, and Zeppa and Spinelloccio being together
               about tierce, Spinelloccio, having promised the lady to come to see
               her at that hour, said to Zeppa: I must go breakfast with a
               friend, whom I had life not keep in waiting; therefore, adieu!
               Nay, but, quoth Zeppa, 'tis not yet breakfast-time. 
               No
               matter, returned Spinelloccio, I have business on which I must
               speak with him; so I must be in good time. 
               Whereupon Spinelloccio
               took his leave of Zeppa, and having reached Zeppa's house by
               a slightly circuitous route, and finding his wife there, was taken by
               her into the chamber, where they had not been long together when
               Zeppa returned. Hearing him come, the lady, feigning no small
               alarm, bundled Spinelloccio into the chest, as her husband had bidden
               her, and having locked him in, left him there. As Zeppa came
               upstairs: Wife, quoth he, is it breakfast time? 
               Ay, husband, 'tis so, replied the lady. 
               Whereupon: Spinelloccio is
               gone to breakfast with a friend to-day, quoth Zeppa, leaving his
               wife at home: get thee to the window, and call her, and bid her
               come and breakfast with us. 
               The lady, whose fear for herself made
               her mighty obedient, did as her husband bade her; and after much
               pressing Spinelloccio's wife came to breakfast with them, though she
               was given to understand that her husband would not be of the company.
               So, she being come, Zeppa received her most affectionately,
               and taking her familiarly by the hand, bade his wife, in an undertone,
               get her to the kitchen; he then led Spinelloccio's wife into the
               chamber, and locked the door. 
               Hearing the key turn in the lock:
               Alas! quoth the lady, what means this, Zeppa? Is't for this you
               have brought me here? Is this the love you bear Spinelloccio? Is
               this your loyalty to him as your friend and comrade? 
               By the time
               she had done speaking, Zeppa, still keeping fast hold of her, was
               beside the chest, in which her husband was locked. Wherefore:
               Madam, quoth he, spare me thy reproaches, until thou hast
               heard what I have to say to thee. I have loved, I yet love, Spinelloccio
               as a brother; and yesterday, though he knew it not, I discovered
               that the trust I reposed in him has for its guerdon that he
               lies with my wife, as with thee. Now, for that I love him, I purpose
               not to be avenged upon him save in the sort in which he
               offended. He has had my wife, and I intend to have thee. 
               So thou
               wilt not grant me what I crave of thee, be sure I shall not fail to
               take it; and having no mind to let this affront pass unavenged, will
               make such play with him that neither thou nor he shall ever be
               happy again. 
               The lady hearkening, and by dint of his repeated
               asseverations coming at length to believe him: Zeppa mine,
               quoth she, as this thy vengeance is to light upon me, well content
               am I; so only thou let not this which we are to do embroil me with
               thy wife, with whom, notwithstanding the evil turn she has done
               me, I am minded to remain at peace. 
               Have no fear on that
               score, replied Zeppa; nay, I will give thee into the bargain a
               jewel so rare and fair that thou hast not the like. Which said,
               he took her in his arms and fell a kissing her, and having laid her
               on the chest, in which her husband was safe under lock and key,
               did there disport himself with her to his heart's content, as she with
               him.
            </p>
            <p>Spinelloccio in the chest heard all that Zeppa had said, and how
               he was answered by the lady, and the Trevisan dance that afterwards
               went on over his head; whereat his mortification was such that for
               a great while he scarce hoped to live through it; and, but for the fear
               he had of Zeppa, he would have given his wife a sound rating, close
               prisoner though he was. But, as he bethought him that 'twas he
               that had given the first affront, and that Zeppa had good cause for
               acting as he did, and that he had dealt with him considerately and
               as a good fellow should, he resolved that if it were agreeable to
               Zeppa, they should be faster friends than ever before. 
               However,
               Zeppa, having had his pleasure with the lady, got down from the
               chest, and being reminded by the lady of his promise of the jewel,
               opened the door of the chamber and brought his wife in. Quoth
               she with a laugh: Madam, you have given me tit for tat, and
               never a word more. Whereupon: Open the chest, quoth
               Zeppa; and she obeying, he shewed the lady her Spinelloccio lying
               therein. 'Twould be hard to say whether of the twain was the
               more shame-stricken, Spinelloccio to be confronted with Zeppa,
               knowing that Zeppa wist what he had done, or the lady to meet her
               husband's eyes, knowing that he had heard what went on above his
               head. Lo, here is the jewel I give thee, quoth Zeppa to her,
               pointing to Spinelloccio, who, as he came forth of the chest, blurted
               out: Zeppa, we are quits, and so 'twere best, as thou saidst a while
               ago to my wife, that we still be friends as we were wont, and as we
               had nought separate, save our wives, that henceforth we have them
               also in common. Content, quoth Zeppa; and so in perfect
               peace and accord they all four breakfasted together. And thenceforth
               each of the ladies had two husbands, and each of the husbands two
               wives; nor was there ever the least dispute or contention between
               them on that score.

                  from whom he received it, were rather to be commended than condemned.
                  The man that got it was a physician, who, albeit he was

            <p>'Tis matter of daily experience that our citizens come back to us
               from <span class="place">Bologna</span>, this man a judge, that a physician, and the other
               a notary, flaunting it in ample flowing robes, and adorned with the
               scarlet and the vair and other array most goodly to see; and how
               far their doings correspond with this fair seeming, is also matter of
               daily experience. Among whom 'tis not long since Master Simone
               da Villa, one whose patrimony was more ample than his knowledge,
               came back wearing the scarlet and a broad stripeThe distinguishing
               mark
               of a doctor in those days. Fanfani, Vocab. della Lingua Italiana,
               1891,
               Batolo. on the shoulder, and
               a doctor, as he called himself, and took a house in the street that we
               now call <span class="place">Via del Cocomero</span>. Now this Master Simone, being thus, as
               we said, come back, had this among other singular habits, that he could
               never see a soul pass along the street, but he must needs ask any that
               was by, who that man was; and he was as observant of all the doings
               of men, and as sedulous to store his memory with such matters, as
               if they were to serve him to compound the drugs that he was to give
               his patients. Now, of all that he saw, those that he eyed most observantly
               were two painters, of whom here to-day mention has twice
               been made, Bruno, to wit, and Buffalmacco, who were ever together,
               and were his neighbours. And as it struck him that they daffed the
               world aside and lived more lightheartedly than any others that he
               knew, as indeed they did, he enquired of not a few folk as to their
               rank. And learning on all hands that they were poor men and
               painters, he could not conceive it possible that they should live thus
               contentedly in poverty, but made his mind up that, being, as he was
               informed, clever fellows, they must have some secret source from
               which they drew immense gains; for which reason he grew all agog
               to get on friendly terms with them, or any rate with one of them,
               and did succeed in making friends with Bruno.
            </p>
            <p>Bruno, who had not needed to be much with him in order to
               discover that this physician was but a dolt, had never such a jolly
               time in palming off his strange stories upon him, while the physician,
               on his part, was marvellously delighted with Bruno; to whom, having
               bidden him to breakfast, and thinking that for that reason he might
               talk familiarly with him, he expressed the amazement with which
               he regarded both him and Buffalmacco, for that, being but poor men,
               they lived so lightheartedly, and asked him to tell him how they
               managed. At which fresh proof of the doctor's simplicity and
               fatuity Bruno was inclined to laugh; but, bethinking him that
               'twere best to answer him according to his folly, he said: Master,
               there are not many persons to whom I would disclose our manner
               of life, but, as you are my friend, and I know you will not let it go
               further, I do not mind telling you. The fact is that my comrade
               and I live not only as lightheartedly and jovially as you see, but
               much more so; and yet neither our art, nor any property that we
               possess, yields us enough to keep us in water: not that I would
               have you suppose that we go a thieving: no, 'tis that we go the
               course, and thereby without the least harm done to a soul we get all
               that we need, nay, all that we desire; and thus it is that we live so
               lightheartedly as you see. 
               Which explanation the doctor believing
               none the less readily that he knew not what it meant, was lost in
               wonder, and forthwith burned with a most vehement desire to know
               what going the course might be, and was instant with Bruno to
               expound it, assuring him that he would never tell a soul. 
               Alas!
               Master, said Bruno, what is this you ask of me? 'Tis a mighty
               great secret you would have me impart to you: 'twould be enough
               to undo me, to send me packing out of the world, nay, into the very
               jaws of Lucifer of <span class="place">San Gallo</span>,Perhaps an allusion to some frightful
               picture. if it came to be known. But such is
               the respect in which I hold your quiditative pumpionship of <span class="place">Legnaia</span>,
               and the trust I repose in you, that I am not able to deny you aught
               you ask of me; and so I will tell it you, on condition that you swear
               by the cross at <span class="place">Montesone</span> that you will keep your promise, and
               never repeat it to a soul.
            </p>
            <p>The Master gave the required assurance. 
               Whereupon: You
               are then to know, quoth Bruno, sweet my Master, that 'tis not
               long since there was in this city a great master in necromancy, hight
               Michael Scott, for that he was of <span class="place">Scotland</span>, and great indeed was the
               honour in which he was held by not a few gentlemen, most of whom
               are now dead; and when the time came that he must needs depart
               from <span class="place">Florence</span>, he at their instant entreaty left behind him two
               pupils, adepts both, whom he bade hold themselves ever ready to
               pleasure those gentlemen who had done him honour. And very
               handsomely they did serve the said gentlemen in certain of their love
               affairs and other little matters; and finding the city and the manners
               of the citizens agreeable to them, they made up their minds to stay
               here always, and grew friendly and very intimate with some of the
               citizens, making no distinction between gentle and simple, rich or
               poor, so only they were such as were conformable to their ways.
               And to gratify these their friends they formed a company of perhaps
               twenty-five men, to meet together at least twice a month in a place
               appointed by them; where, when they are met, each utters his
               desire, and forthwith that same night they accomplish it. Now
               Buffalmacco and I, being extraordinarily great and close friends with
               these two adepts, were by them enrolled in this company, and are
               still members of it. And I assure you that, as often as we are
               assembled together, the adornments of the saloon in which we eat
               are a marvel to see, ay, and the tables laid as for kings, and the
               multitudes of stately and handsome servants, as well women as men,
               at the beck and call of every member of the company, and the basins,
               and the ewers, the flasks and the cups, and all else that is there for
               our service in eating and drinking, of nought but gold and silver, and
               therewithal the abundance and variety of the viands, suited to the
               taste of each, that are set before us, each in due course, these too be
               marvels. 'Twere vain for me to seek to describe to you the sweet
               concord that is there of innumerable instruments of music, and the
               tuneful songs that salute our ears; nor might I hope to tell you how
               much wax is burned at these banquets, or compute the quantity of the
               comfits that are eaten, or the value of the wines that are drunk.
               Nor, my pumpkin o' wit, would I have you suppose that, when we
               are there, we wear our common clothes, such as you now see me
               wear; nay, there is none there so humble but he shews as an
               emperor, so sumptuous are our garments, so splendid our trappings.
               But among all the delights of the place none may compare with the
               fair ladies, who, so one do but wish, are brought thither from every
               part of the world. Why, you might see there My Lady of the
               Barbanichs, the Queen of the Basques, the Consort of the Soldan,
               the Empress of Osbech, the Ciancianfera of Nornieca, the Semistante
               of <span class="place">Berlinzone</span>, and the Scalpedra of <span class="place">Narsia</span>. But why seek to enumerate
               them all? They include all the queens in the world, ay, even to
               the Schinchimurra of Prester John, who has the horns sprouting out
               of her nether end: so there's for you. Now when these ladies have
               done with the wine and the comfits, they tread a measure or two,
               each with the man at whose behest she is come, and then all go with
               their gallants to their chambers. And know that each of these
               chambers shews as a very Paradise, so fair is it, ay, and no less
               fragrant than the cases of aromatics in your shop when you are
               pounding the cumin: and therein are beds that you would find more
               goodly than that of the Doge of <span class="place">Venice</span>, and 'tis in them we take
               our rest; and how busily they ply the treadle, and how lustily they
               tug at the frame to make the stuff close and compact, I leave you to
               imagine. However, among the luckiest of all I reckon Buffalmacco
               and myself; for that Buffalmacco for the most part fetches him the
               Queen of <span class="place">France</span>, and I do the like with the Queen of <span class="place">England</span>, who
               are just the finest women in the world, and we have known how to
               carry it with them so that we are the very eyes of their heads. 
               So
               I leave it to your own judgment to determine whether we have not
               good cause to live and bear ourselves with a lighter heart than others,
               seeing that we are beloved of two such great queens, to say nothing
               of the thousand or two thousand florins that we have of them whenever
               we are so minded. Now this in the vulgar we call going the
               course, because, as the corsairs prey upon all the world, so do we;
               albeit with this difference, that, whereas they never restore their spoil,
               we do so as soon as we have done with it. So now, my worthy
               Master, you understand what we mean by going the course; but
               how close it behoves you to keep such a secret, you may see for
               yourself; so I spare you any further exhortations.
            </p>
            <p>The Master, whose skill did not reach, perhaps, beyond the treatment
               of children for the scurf, took all that Bruno said for gospel,
               and burned with so vehement a desire to be admitted into this company,
               that he could not have longed for the summum bonum itself
               with more ardour. So, after telling Bruno that indeed 'twas no
               wonder they bore them lightheartedly, he could scarce refrain from
               asking him there and then to have him enrolled, albeit he deemed it
               more prudent to defer his suit, until by lavishing honour upon him
               he had gained a right to urge it with more confidence. He therefore
               made more and more of him, had him to breakfast and sup with
               him, and treated him with extraordinary respect. In short, such and
               so constant was their intercourse that it seemed as though the Master
               wist not how to live without Bruno. As it went so well with him,
               Bruno, to mark his sense of the honour done him by the doctor,
               painted in his saloon a picture symbolical of Lent, and an Agnus
               Dei at the entrance of his chamber, and an alembic over his front
               door, that those who would fain consult him might know him from
               other physicians, besides a battle of rats and mice in his little gallery,
               which the doctor thought an extremely fine piece. And from time
               to time, when he had not supped with the Master, he would say to
               him: Last night I was with the company, and being a little tired
               of the Queen of <span class="place">England</span>, I fetched me the Gumedra of the great
               	Can of Tarisi. Gumedra, quoth the Master; what is she?
               I know not the meaning of these words. 
               Thereat, Master,
               replied Bruno, I marvel not; for I have heard tell that neither
               Porcograsso nor Vannacena say aught thereof. 
               Thou wouldst say
               Ippocrasso and Avicenna, returned the Master. 
               I'faith I know
               not, quoth Bruno. I as ill know the meaning of your words as
               you of mine. But Gumedra in the speech of the great Can signifies
               the same as Empress in ours. Ah! a fine woman you would find
               her, and plenty of her! I warrant she would make you forget your
               drugs and prescriptions and plasters. 
               And so, Bruno from time to
               time whetting the Master's appetite, and the Master at length thinking
               that by his honourable entreatment of him he had fairly made a
               conquest of Bruno, it befell that one evening, while he held the light
               for Bruno, who was at work on the battle of rats and mice, he
               determined to discover to him his desire; and as they were alone,
               thus he spoke: God knows, Bruno, that there lives not the man,
               for whom I would do as much as for thee: why, if thou wast to bid
               me go all the way from here to <span class="place">Peretola</span>,About four miles from
               <span class="place">Florence</span>. I almost think I would do
               so; wherefore I trust thou wilt not deem it strange if I talk to thee
               as an intimate friend and in confidence. Thou knowest 'tis not long
               since thou didst enlarge with me on thy gay company and their
               doings, which has engendered in me such a desire as never was to
               know more thereof. Nor without reason, as thou wilt discover,
               should I ever become a member of the said company, for I straightway
               give thee leave to make game of me, should I not then fetch
               me the fairest maid thou hast seen this many a day, whom I saw
               last year at <span class="place">Cacavincigli</span>, and to whom I am entirely devoted; and by
               the body of Christ I offered her ten Bolognese groats, that she should
               pleasure me, and she would not. Wherefore I do most earnestly
               entreat thee to instruct me what I must do to fit myself for membership
               in the company; and never doubt that in me you will have a true
               and loyal comrade, and one that will do you honour. And above all
               thou seest how goodly I am of my person, and how well furnished
               with legs, and of face as fresh as a rose; and therewithal I am a
               doctor of medicine, and I scarce think you have any such among
               you; and not a little excellent lore I have, and many a good song by
               heart, of which I will sing thee one; and forthwith he fell a
               singing.
            </p>
            <p>Bruno had such a mind to laugh, that he could scarce contain
               himself; but still he kept a grave countenance; and, when the
               Master had ended his song, and said: How likes it thee? 
               he answered: Verily, no lyre of straw could vie with you, so
               artarguticallyIn the Italian artagoticamente, a word of
               Boccaccio's own minting. you refine your strain. 
               I warrant
               thee, returned the
               Master, thou hadst never believed it, hadst thou not heard me.
               Ay, indeed, sooth sayst thou, quoth Bruno. 
               And I have other
               songs to boot, said the Master; but enough of this at present. Thou
               must know that I, such as thou seest me, am a gentleman's son, albeit
               my father lived in the contado; and on my mother's side I come of
               the <span class="place">Vallecchio</span> family. And as thou mayst have observed I have
               quite the finest library and wardrobe of all the physicians in <span class="place">Florence</span>.
               God's faith! I have a robe that cost, all told, close upon a hundred
               pounds in bagattinesA Venetian coin of extremely low value, being
               reckoned as 1/4 of the Florentine quattrino. more than ten years ago.
               Wherefore I make
               most instant suit to thee that thou get me enrolled, which if thou do,
               God's faith! be thou never so ill, thou shalt pay me not a stiver for
               my tendance of thee. 
               Whereupon Bruno, repeating to himself, as
               he had done many a time before, that the doctor was a very numskull:
               Master, quoth he, shew a little more light here, and
               have patience until I have put the finishing touches to the tails of these
               rats, and then I will answer you. 
               So he finished the tails,
               and then, putting on an air as if he were not a little embarrassed by
               the request: Master mine, quoth he, I should have great
               things to expect from you; that I know: but yet what you ask of
               me, albeit to your great mind it seems but a little thing, is a weighty
               matter indeed for me; nor know I a soul in the world, to whom,
               though well able, I would grant such a request, save to you alone:
               and this I say not for friendship's sake alone, albeit I love you as I
               ought, but for that your discourse is so fraught with wisdom, that 'tis
               enough to make a beguine start out of her boots, much more, then, to
               incline me to change my purpose; and the more I have of your
               company, the wiser I repute you. Whereto I may add, that, if for
               no other cause, I should still be well disposed towards you for the
               love I see you bear to that fair piece of flesh of which you spoke but
               now. But this I must tell you: 'tis not in my power to do as you
               would have me in this matter; but, though I cannot myself do the
               needful in your behalf, if you will pledge your faith, whole and solid
               as may be, to keep my secret, I will shew you how to go about it
               for yourself, and I make no doubt that, having this fine library and
               the other matters you spoke of a while ago, you will compass your
               end. 
               Quoth then the Master: Nay, but speak freely; I see
               thou dost yet scarce know me, and how well I can keep a secret.
               There were few things that Messer Guasparruolo da Saliceto did,
               when he was Podestà of Forlinpopoli, that he did not confide to me,
               so safe he knew they would be in my keeping: and wouldst thou
               be satisfied that I say sooth? I assure you I was the first man whom
               he told that he was about to marry <span class="person">Bergamina</span>: so there's for thee.
               Well and good, said Bruno, if such as he confided in you, well
               indeed may I do the like. Know, then, that you will have to proceed
               on this wise: Our company is governed by a captain and a
               council of two, who are changed every six months: and on the
               calends without fail Buffalmacco will be captain, and I councillor:
               'tis so fixed: and the captain has not a little power to promote the
               admission and enrolment of whomsoever he will: wherefore, methinks,
               you would do well to make friends with Buffalmacco and
               honourably entreat him: he is one that, marking your great wisdom,
               will take a mighty liking to you forthwith; and when you have just
               a little dazzled him with your wisdom and these fine things of yours,
               you may make your request to him; and he will not know how to
               say no--I have already talked with him of you, and he is as well
               disposed to you as may be--and having so done you will leave the
               rest to me. Whereupon: Thy words are to me for an exceeding
               great joy, quoth the Master: and if he be one that loves to
               converse with sages, he has but to exchange a word or two with
               me, and I will answer for it that he will be ever coming to see me;
               for so fraught with wisdom am I, that I could furnish a whole city
               therewith, and still remain a great sage.
            </p>
            <p>Having thus set matters in train, Bruno related the whole affair,
               point by point, to Buffalmacco, to whom it seemed a thousand years
               till he should be able to give Master Noodle that of which he was in
               quest. The doctor, now all agog to go the course, lost no time, and
               found no difficulty, in making friends with Buffalmacco, and fell to
               entertaining him, and Bruno likewise, at breakfast and supper in
               most magnificent style; while they fooled him to the top of his
               bent, for, being gentlemen that appreciated excellent wines and fat
               capons, besides other good cheer in plenty, they were inclined to be
               very neighbourly, and needed no second bidding, but, always letting
               him understand that there was none other whose company they
               relished so much, kept ever with him.
            </p>
            <p>However, in due time the Master asked of Buffalmacco that
               which he had before asked of Bruno. Whereat Buffalmacco feigned
               to be not a little agitated, and turning angrily to Bruno, made a
               great pother about his ears, saying: By the Most High God of
               Pasignano I vow I can scarce forbear to give thee that over the head
               that should make they nose fall about thy heels, traitor that thou art,
               for 'tis thou alone that canst have discovered these secrets to the
               Master. 
               Whereupon the Master interposed with no little vigour,
               averring with oaths that 'twas from another source that he had gotten
               his knowledge; and Buffalmacco at length allowed himself to be
               pacified by the sage's words. So turning to him: Master, quoth
               he, 'tis evident indeed that you have been at <span class="place">Bologna</span>, and have
               come back hither with a mouth that blabs not, and that 'twas on no
               pippin, as many a dolt does, but on the good long pumpkin that you
               learned your A B C; and, if I mistake not, you were baptized on a
               Sunday;I.e. without salt, that Florentine symbol of wit, not
               being so readily procurable on a holiday as on working-days. 
               	and
               though Bruno has told me that 'twas medicine you
               studied there, 'tis my opinion that you there studied the art of
               catching men, of which, what with your wisdom and your startling
               revelations, you are the greatest master that ever I knew. 
               He
               would have said more, but the doctor, turning to Bruno, broke in
               with: Ah! what it is to consort and converse with the wise!
               Who but this worthy man would thus have read my mind through
               and through? Less quick by far to rate me at my true worth wast
               thou. But what said I when thou toldst me that Buffalmacco
               delighted to converse with sages? Confess now; have I not kept
               my word? 
               Verily, quoth Bruno, you have more than kept
               it. 
               Then, addressing Buffalmacco: Ah! cried the Master,
               what hadst thou said, hadst thou seen me at <span class="place">Bologna</span>, where there
               was none, great or small, doctor or scholar, but was devoted to me,
               so well wist I how to entertain them with my words of wisdom.
               
               Nay more; let me tell thee that there was never a word I spoke but
               set every one a laughing, so great was the pleasure it gave them.
               And at my departure they all deplored it most bitterly, and would
               have had me remain, and by way of inducement went so far as to
               propose that I should be sole lecturer to all the students in medicine
               that were there; which offer I declined, for that I was minded to
               return hither, having vast estates here, that have ever belonged to
               my family; which, accordingly, I did. 
               Quoth then Bruno to
               Buffalmacco: How shews it, now, man? Thou didst not believe
               me when I told thee what he was. By the Gospels there is never a
               physician in this city that has the lore of ass's urine by heart as he
               has: verily, thou wouldst not find his like between here and the
               gates of <span class="place">Paris</span>. Now see if thou canst help doing as he would have
               thee. 
               'Tis even as Bruno says, observed the doctor, but I am
               not understood here. You Florentines are somewhat slow of wit.
               Would you could see me in my proper element, among a company
               of doctors! 
               Whereupon: Of a truth, Master, quoth Buffalmacco,
               your lore far exceeds any I should ever have imputed to
               you; wherefore, addressing you as 'tis meet to address a man of your
               wisdom, I give you disjointedly to understand that without fail I will
               procure your enrolment in our company.
            </p>
            <p>After this promise the honours lavished by the doctor upon the
               two men grew and multiplied; in return for which they diverted
               themselves by setting him a prancing upon every wildest chimera in
               the world; and promised, among other matters, to give him by way
               of mistress, the Countess of <span class="place">Civillari</span>,A public sink at
               <span class="place">Florence</span>.
               whom they averred to be the
               goodliest creature to be found in all the Netherlands of the human
               race; and the doctor asking who this Countess might be: Mature
               my gherkin, quoth Buffalmacco, she is indeed a very great lady,
               and few houses are there in the world in which she has not some
               jurisdiction; nay, the very Friars Minors, to say nought of other
               folk, pay her tribute to the sound of the kettle-drum. 
               And I may
               tell you that, when she goes abroad, she makes her presence very
               sensibly felt, albeit for the most part she keeps herself close: however,
               'tis no great while since she passed by your door one night on
               her way to the <span class="place">Arno</span> to bathe her feet and get a breath of air; but
               most of her time she abides at Laterina.In the contado of
               <span class="place">Arezzo</span>:
               the équivoque is tolerably obvious. 
               Serjeants has she
               not
               a
               few that go their rounds at short intervals, bearing, one and all, the
               rod and the bucket in token of her sovereignty, and barons in plenty
               in all parts, as Tamagnino della Porta,Slang for an ill-kept
               jakes. Don Meta,Also slang: signifying a pyramidal pile of
               ordure. Manico di Scopa,Broom-handle.
               Squacchera,The meaning of this term may perhaps be divined from the
               sound. and others, with whom I doubt not you are intimately
               acquainted, though you may not just now bear them in mind. 
               Such,
               then, is the great lady, in whose soft arms we, if we delude not ourselves,
               will certainly place you, in which case you may well dispense
               with her of <span class="place">Cacavincigli</span>.
            </p>
            <p>The doctor, who had been born and bred at <span class="place">Bologna</span>, and understood
               not their words, found the lady quite to his mind; and shortly
               afterwards the painters brought him tidings of his election into the
               company. Then came the day of the nocturnal gathering, and the
               doctor had the two men to breakfast; and when they had breakfasted,
               he asked them after what manner he was to join the company.
               Whereupon: Lo, now, Master, quoth Buffalmacco, you have
               need of a stout heart; otherwise you may meet with some let, to
               our most grievous hurt; and for what cause you have need of this
               stout heart, you shall hear. You must contrive to be to-night about
               the hour of first sleep on one of the raised tombs that have been
               lately placed outside of <span class="place">Santa Maria Novella</span>; and mind that you
               wear one of your best gowns, that your first appearance may impress
               the company with a proper sense of your dignity, and also because,
               as we are informed, for we were not present at the time, the
               Countess, by reason that you are a gentleman, is minded to make you
               a Knight of the Bath at her own charges. So you will wait there,
               until one, whom we shall send, come for you: who, that you may
               know exactly what you have to expect, will be a beast black and
               horned, of no great size; and he will go snorting and bounding
               amain about the piazza in front of you, with intent to terrify you;
               but, when he perceives that you are not afraid, he will draw nigh you
               quietly, and when he is close by you, then get you down from the
               tomb, fearing nothing; and, minding you neither of God nor of the
               saints, mount him, and when you are well set on his back, then fold
               your arms upon your breast, as in submission, and touch him no
               more. Then, going gently, he will bear you to us; but once mind
               you of God, or the saints, or give way to fear, and I warn you, he
               might give you a fall, or dash you against something that you would
               find scarce pleasant; wherefore, if your heart misgives you, you were
               best not to come, for you would assuredly do yourself a mischief, and
               us no good at all. 
               Quoth then the doctor: You know me not
               as yet; 'tis perchance because I wear the gloves and the long robe
               that you misdoubt me. Ah! did you but know what feats I have
               done in times past at <span class="place">Bologna</span>, when I used to go after the women
               with my comrades, you would be lost in amazement. 
               God's faith!
               on one of those nights there was one of them, a poor sickly creature
               she was too, and stood not a cubit in height, who would not come
               with us; so first I treated her to many a good cuff, and then I took
               her up by main force, and carried her well-nigh as far as a cross-bow
               will send a bolt, and so caused her, willy-nilly, come with us. And
               on another occasion I mind me that, having none other with me but
               my servant, a little after the hour of Ave Maria, I passed beside the
               cemetery of the Friars Minors, and, though that very day a woman
               had been there interred, I had no fear at all. So on this score you
               may make your minds easy; for indeed I am a man of exceeding
               great courage and prowess. And to appear before you with due
               dignity, I will don my scarlet gown, in which I took my doctor's
               degree, and it remains to be seen if the company will not give me a
               hearty welcome, and make me captain out of hand. Let me once
               be there, and you will see how things will go; else how is it that
               this countess, that has not yet seen me, is already so enamoured of
               me that she is minded to make me a Knight of the Bath? And
               whether I shall find knighthood agreeable, or know how to support
               the dignity well or ill, leave that to me. 
               Whereupon: Well
               said, excellent well said, quoth Buffalmacco: but look to it you
               disappoint us not, either by not coming or by not being found, when
               we send for you; and this I say, because 'tis cold weather, and you
               medical gentlemen take great care of your health. 
               God forbid,
               replied the doctor, I am none of your chilly folk; I fear not the
               cold: 'tis seldom indeed, when I leave my bed a nights, to answer
               the call of nature, as one must at times, that I do more than throw
               a pelisse over my doublet; so rest assured that I shall be there.
            </p>
            <p>So they parted; and towards nightfall the Master found a pretext
               for leaving his wife, and privily got out his fine gown, which in due
               time he donned, and so hied him to the tombs, and having perched
               himself on one of them, huddled himself together, for 'twas mighty
               cold, to await the coming of the beast. Meanwhile Buffalmacco,
               who was a tall man and strong, provided himself with one of those
               dominos that were wont to be worn in certain revels which are now
               gone out of fashion; and enveloped in a black pelisse turned inside
               out, shewed like a bear, save that the domino had the face of a devil,
               and was furnished with horns: in which guise, Bruno following
               close behind to see the sport, he hied him to the piazza of Santa
               Maria Novella. And no sooner wist he that the Master was on
               the tomb, than he fell a careering in a most wild and furious manner
               to and fro the piazza, and snorting and bellowing and gibbering like
               one demented, insomuch that, as soon as the Master was ware of him,
               each several hair on his head stood on end, and he fell a trembling
               in every limb, being in sooth more timid than a woman, and wished
               himself safe at home: but as there he was, he strove might and
               main to keep his spirits up, so overmastering was his desire to see the
               marvels of which Bruno and Buffalmacco had told him. However,
               after a while Buffalmacco allowed his fury to abate, and came quietly
               up to the tomb on which the Master was, and stood still. The
               Master, still all of a tremble with fear, could not at first make up his
               mind, whether to get on the beast's back, or no; but at length,
               doubting it might be the worse for him if he did not mount the
               beast, he overcame the one dread by the aid of the other, got down
               from the tomb, saying under his breath: God help me! and
               seated himself very comfortably on the beast's back; and then, still
               quaking in every limb, he folded his arms as he had been bidden.
            </p>
            <p>Buffalmacco now started, going on all-fours, at a very slow pace,
               in the direction of <span class="place">Santa Maria della Scala</span>, and so brought the
               Master within a short distance of the Convent of the Ladies of <span class="place">Ripoli</span>.
               Now, in that quarter there were divers trenches, into which the
               husbandmen of those parts were wont to discharge the Countess of
               <span class="place">Civillari</span>, that she might afterwards serve them to manure their land.
               Of one of which trenches, as he came by, Buffalmacco skirted the
               edge, and seizing his opportunity, raised a hand, and caught the
               doctor by one of his feet, and threw him off his back and head-foremost
               right into the trench, and then, making a terrific noise and
               frantic gestures as before, went bounding off by Santa Maria della
               Scala towards the field of Ognissanti, where he found Bruno, who
               had betaken him thither that he might laugh at his ease; and there
               the two men in high glee took their stand to observe from a distance
               how the bemired doctor would behave. Finding himself in so loathsome
               a place, the Master struggled might and main to raise himself
               and get out; and though again and again he slipped back, and
               swallowed some drams of the ordure, yet, bemired from head to foot,
               woebegone and crestfallen, he did at last get out, leaving his hood
               behind him. Then, removing as much of the filth as he might with
               his hands, knowing not what else to do, he got him home, where,
               by dint of much knocking, he at last gained admittance; and scarce
               was the door closed behind the malodorous Master, when Bruno and
               Buffalmacco were at it, all agog to hear after what manner he would
               be received by his wife. They were rewarded by hearing her give
               him the soundest rating that ever bad husband got. 
               Ah! quoth
               she, fine doings, these! Thou hast been with some other woman,
               and wast minded to make a brave shew in thy scarlet gown. So I
               was not enough for thee! not enough for thee forsooth, I that might
               content a crowd! Would they had choked thee with the filth in
               which they have soused thee; 'twas thy fit resting-place. Now, to
               think that a physician of repute, and a married man, should go by
               night after strange women! 
               Thus, and with much more to the
               like effect, while the doctor was busy washing himself, she ceased
               not to torment him until midnight.
            </p>
            <p>On the morrow, Bruno and Buffalmacco, having painted their
               bodies all over with livid patches to give them the appearance of
               having been thrashed, came to the doctor's house, and finding that
               he was already risen, went in, being saluted on all hands by a foul
               smell, for time had not yet served thoroughly to cleanse the house.
               The doctor, being informed that they were come to see him,
               advanced to meet them, and bade them good morning. Whereto
               Bruno and Buffalmacco, having prepared their answer, replied:
               
               No good morning shall you have from us: rather we pray God to
               give you bad years enough to make an end of you, seeing that there
               lives no more arrant and faithless traitor. 'Tis no fault of yours, if
               we, that did our best to honour and pleasure you, have not come by
               a dog's death; 
               your faithlessness has cost us to-night as many sound
               blows as would more than suffice to keep an ass a trotting all the
               way from here to <span class="place">Rome</span>; besides which, we have been in peril of
               expulsion from the company in which we arranged for your enrolment.
               If you doubt our words, look but at our bodies, what a state
               they are in. And so, baring their breasts they gave him a glimpse
               of the patches they had painted there, and forthwith covered them
               up again. The doctor would have made them his excuses, and
               recounted his misfortunes, and how he had been thrown into the
               trench. But Buffalmacco broke in with: Would he had thrown
               you from the bridge into the <span class="place">Arno</span>! Why must you needs mind
               you of God and the saints? Did we not forewarn you? 
               God's
               faith, returned the doctor, that did I not. 
               How? quoth
               Buffalmacco, you did not? You do so above a little; for he that
               we sent for you told us that you trembled like an aspen, and knew not
               where you were. You have played us a sorry trick; but never
               another shall do so; and as for you, we will give you such requital
               thereof as you deserve. 
               The doctor now began to crave their
               pardon, and to implore them for God's sake not to expose him to
               shame, and used all the eloquence at his command to make his peace
               with them. And if he had honourably entreated them before, he
               thenceforth, for fear they should publish his disgrace, did so much
               more abundantly, and courted them both by entertaining them at his
               table and in other ways. And so you have heard how wisdom is
               imparted to those that get it not at <span class="place">Bologna</span>.

               goods than before, borrows money of her, and leaves
               her in lieu thereof water and tow.

               <p>How much in divers passages the queen's story moved the ladies
                  to laughter, it boots not to ask: none was there in whose eyes the
                  tears stood not full a dozen times for excess of merriment. However,
                  it being ended, and <span class="person">Dioneo</span> witting that 'twas now his turn,

            </div>
            <div class="frame">
               <p>Gracious ladies, 'tis patent to all that wiles are
                  diverting in the degree of the wiliness of him that is by them
                  beguiled. Wherefore, albeit stories most goodly have been told by
                  you all, I purpose to relate one which should afford you more
                  pleasure than any that has been told, seeing that she that was
                  beguiled was far more cunning in beguiling others than any of the
                  beguiled of whom you have spoken.
               </p>
            </div>
            <p>There was, and perhaps still is, a custom in all maritime
               countries that have ports, that all merchants arriving there with
               merchandise, should, on discharging, bring all their goods into a
               warehouse, called in many places dogana, and maintained by
               the state, or the lord of the land; where those that are assigned
               to that office allot to each merchant, on receipt of an invoice of
               all his goods and the value thereof, a room in which he stores
               his goods under lock and key; whereupon the said officers of the
               dogana enter all the merchant's goods to his credit in the book
               of the dogana, and afterwards make him pay duty thereon, or on
               such part as he withdraws from the warehouse. By which book of
               the dogana the brokers not seldom find out the sorts and quantities
               of the merchandise that is there, and also who are the owners
               thereof, with whom, as occasion serves, they afterwards treat of
               exchanges, barters, sales and other modes of disposing of the goods.
               Which custom obtained, as in many other places, so also at <span class="place">Palermo</span>
               in <span class="place">Sicily</span>, where in like manner there were and are not a few women,
               fair as fair can be, but foes to virtue, who by whoso knows them not
               would be reputed great and most virtuous ladies. 
               And being given
               not merely to fleece but utterly to flay men, they no sooner espy a
               foreign merchant in the city, than they find out from the book of
               the dogana how much he has there and what he is good for; and
               then by caressing and amorous looks and gestures, and words of
               honeyed sweetness, they strive to entice and allure the merchant to
               their love, and not seldom have they succeeded, and wrested from
               him great part or the whole of his merchandise; and of some they
               have gotten goods and ship and flesh and bones, so delightsomely
               have they known how to ply the shears.
            </p>
            <p>Now 'tis not long since one of our young Florentines, Niccolò da
               Cignano by name, albeit he was called Salabaetto, arrived there,
               being sent by his masters with all the woollen stuffs that he had not
               been able to dispose of at <span class="place">Salerno</span> fair, which might perhaps be
               worth five hundred florins of gold; and having given the invoice to
               the officers of the dogana and stored the goods, Salabaetto was in no
               hurry to get them out of bond, but took a stroll or two about the
               city for his diversion. And as he was fresh-complexioned and fair
               and not a little debonair, it so befell that one of these ladies that
               plied the shears, and called herself Jancofiore, began to ogle him.
               Whereof he taking note, and deeming that she was a great lady,
               supposed that she was taken by his good looks, and cast about how
               he might manage this amour with all due discretion; wherefore,
               saying nought to a soul, he began to pass to and fro before her house.
               Which she observing, occupied herself for a few days in inflaming
               his passion, and then affecting to be dying of love for him, sent
               privily to him a woman that she had in her service, and who was an
               adept in the arts of the procuress. She, after not a little palaver,
               told him, while the tears all but stood in her eyes, that for his handsome
               person and winsome air her mistress was so enamoured of him,
               that she found no peace by day or by night; and therefore, if 'twere
               agreeable to him, there was nought she desired so much as to meet
               him privily at a bagnio: whereupon she drew a ring from her purse,
               and gave it him by way of token from her mistress. Overjoyed as
               ne'er another to hear such good news, Salabaetto took the ring, and,
               after drawing it across his eyes and kissing it, put it on his finger,
               and told the good woman that, if Madonna Jancofiore loved him,
               she was well requited, for that he loved her more dearly than himself,
               and that he was ready to meet her wherever and whenever she might
               see fit. With which answer the procuress hied her back to her
               mistress, and shortly afterwards Salabaetto was informed that he was
               to meet the lady at a certain bagnio at vespers of the ensuing day.
            </p>
            <p>So, saying nought to a soul of the matter, he hied him punctually
               at the appointed hour to the bagnio, and found that it had been taken
               by the lady; nor had he long to wait before two female slaves made
               their appearance, bearing on their heads, the one a great and goodly
               mattress of wadding, and the other a huge and well-filled basket; and
               having laid the mattress on a bedstead in one of the rooms of the bagnio,
               they covered it with a pair of sheets of the finest fabric, bordered with
               silk, and a quilt of the whitest <span class="place">Cyprus</span> buckram, with two
               daintily-embroidered
               pillows. The slaves then undressed and got into the
               bath, which they thoroughly washed and scrubbed: whither soon
               afterwards the lady, attended by other two female slaves, came,
               and made haste to greet Salabaetto with the heartiest of cheer; and
               when, after heaving many a mighty sigh, she had embraced and
               kissed him: I know not, quoth she, who but thou could have
               brought me to this, such a fire hast thou kindled in my soul, little
               dog of a Tuscan! 
               Whereupon she was pleased that they should
               undress, and get into the bath, and two of the slaves with them;
               which, accordingly, they did; and she herself, suffering none other to
               lay a hand upon him, did with wondrous care wash Salabaetto from
               head to foot with soap perfumed with musk and cloves; after which
               she let the slaves wash and shampoo herself. The slaves then
               brought two spotless sheets of finest texture, which emitted such a
               scent of roses, that 'twas as if there was nought there but roses, in
               one of which having wrapped Salabaetto, and in the other the lady,
               they bore them both to bed, where, the sheets in which they were
               enfolded being withdrawn by the slaves as soon as they had done
               sweating, they remained stark naked in the others. The slaves then
               took from the basket cruets of silver most goodly, and full, this of
               rose-water, that of water of orange-blossom, a third of water of
               jasmine-blossom, and a fourth of nanfaNeither the Vocab. degli
               Accad. della Crusca nor the Riccbezze attempts
               to define the precise nature of this scent, which Fanfani identifies with
               that
               of the orange-blossom. water, wherewith they
               sprinkled them: after which, boxes of comfits and the finest wines
               being brought forth, they regaled them a while. To Salabaetto 'twas
               as if he were in Paradise; a thousand times he scanned the lady,
               who was indeed most beautiful; and he counted each hour as
               a hundred years until the slaves should get them gone, and he find
               himself in the lady's arms.
            </p>
            <p>At length, by the lady's command, the slaves departed, leaving a
               lighted torch in the room, and then the lady and Salabaetto embraced,
               and to Salabaetto's prodigious delight, for it seemed to him that she
               was all but dissolved for love of him, tarried there a good while.
               However, the time came when the lady must needs rise: so she
               called the slaves, with whose help they dressed, regaled them again
               for a while with wine and comfits, and washed their faces and hands
               with the odoriferous waters. Then as they were going, quoth the
               lady to Salabaetto: If it be agreeable to thee, I should deem it a
               very great favour if thou wouldst come to-night to sup and sleep
               with me. Salabaetto, who, captivated by her beauty and her
               studied graciousness, never doubted but he was dear to her as her
               very heart, made answer: Madam, there is nought you can
               desire but is in the last degree agreeable to me; wherefore to-night
               and ever 'tis my purpose to do whatsoever you may be pleased to
               command. 
               So home the lady hied her, and having caused a brave
               shew to be made in her chamber with her dresses and other paraphernalia,
               and a grand supper to be prepared, awaited Salabaetto;
               who, being come there as soon as 'twas dark, had of her a gladsome
               welcome, and was regaled with an excellent and well-served supper.
               After which, they repaired to the chamber, where he was saluted by
               a wondrous sweet odour of aloe-wood, and observed that the bed
               was profusely furnished with birds,I. e. with a sort of
               musical
               boxes in the shape of birds. after the fashion of <span class="place">Cyprus</span>, and
               that not a few fine dresses were hanging upon the pegs. Which
               circumstances did, one and all, beget in him the belief that this must
               be a great and wealthy lady; and, though he had heard a hint or
               two to the contrary touching her life, he would by no means credit
               them; nor, supposing that she had perchance taken another with
               guile, would he believe that the same thing might befall him. So to
               his exceeding great solace, he lay with her that night, and ever grew
               more afire for her. On the morrow, as she was investing him with
               a fair and dainty girdle of silver, with a goodly purse attached:
               Sweet my Salabaetto, quoth she, prithee forget me not; even
               as my person, so is all that I have at thy pleasure, and all that
               I can at thy command.
            </p>
            <p>Salabaetto then embraced and kissed her, and so bade her adieu,
               and betook him to the place where the merchants were wont to congregate.
               And so it befell that he, continuing to consort with her
               from time to time, and being never a denier the poorer thereby,
               disposed of his merchandise for ready money and at no small profit;
               whereof not by him but by another the lady was forthwith advised.
               And Salabaetto being come to see her one evening, she greeted him
               gaily and gamesomely, and fell a kissing and hugging him, and made
               as if she were so afire for love of him that she was like to die thereof
               in his arms; and offered to give him two most goodly silver cups
               that she had, which Salabaetto would not accept, having already had
               from her (taking one time with another) fully thirty florins of gold,
               while he had not been able to induce her to touch so much as a groat
               of his money. But when by this shew of passion and generosity
               she had thoroughly kindled his flame, in came, as she had arranged,
               one of her slaves, and spoke to her; whereupon out of the room she
               went, and after a while came back in tears, and threw herself prone
               on the bed, and set up the most dolorous lamentation that ever
               woman made. Whereat Salabaetto wondering, took her in his arms,
               and mingled his tears with hers, and said: Alas! heart of my
               body! what ails thee thus of a sudden? Wherefore art thou so
               distressed? Ah! tell me the reason, my soul. 
               The lady allowed
               him to run on in this strain for a good while, and then: Alas!
               sweet my lord, quoth she, 
               I know not either what to do or what
               to say. I have but now received a letter from <span class="place">Messina</span>, in which my
               brother bids me sell, if need be, all that I have here, and send him
               without fail within eight days a thousand florins of gold: otherwise
               he will forfeit his head. I know not how to come by them so soon:
               had I but fifteen days, I would make a shift to raise them in a quarter
               where I might raise a much larger sum, or I would sell one of our
               estates; but, as this may not be, would I had been dead or e'er this
               bad news had reached me! Which said, affecting to be utterly
               broken-hearted, she ceased not to weep.
            </p>
            <p>Salabaetto, the ardour of whose passion had in great measure
               deprived him of the sagacity which the circumstances demanded,
               supposed that the tears were genuine enough, and the words even
               more so. Wherefore: Madam, quoth he, I could not furnish
               you with a thousand, but if five hundred florins of gold would suffice,
               they are at your service, if you think you could repay them within
               fifteen days; and you may deem yourself in luck's way, for 'twas
               only yesterday that I sold my woollens, which had I not done, I
               could not have lent you a groat. 
               Alas! returned the lady,
               then thou hast been in straits for money? Oh! why didst thou
               not apply to me? Though I have not a thousand at my command,
               I could have given thee quite a hundred, nay indeed two hundred
               florins. By what thou hast said thou hast made me hesitate to accept
               the service that thou proposest to render me. Which words fairly
               delivered Salabaetto into the lady's hands, insomuch that: Madam,
               quoth he, I would not have you decline my help for such a scruple;
               for had my need been as great as yours, I should certainly have
               applied to you. 
               Quoth then the lady: Ah! Salabaetto mine,
               well I wot that the love thou bearest me is a true and perfect love,
               seeing that, without waiting to be asked, thou dost so handsomely
               come to my aid with so large a sum of money. And albeit I was
               thine without this token of thy love, yet, assuredly, it has made me
               thine in an even greater degree; nor shall I ever forget that 'tis to
               thee I owe my brother's life. 
               But God knows I take thy money
               from thee reluctantly, seeing that thou art a merchant, and 'tis by
               means of money that merchants conduct all their affairs; but, as
               necessity constrains me, and I have good hope of speedily repaying
               thee, I will even take it, and by way of security, if I should find no
               readier method, I will pawn all that I have here. Which said, she
               burst into tears, and fell upon Salabaetto, pressing her cheek upon
               his.
            </p>
            <p>Salabaetto tried to comfort her; and having spent the night with
               her, on the morrow, being minded to shew himself her most devoted
               servant, brought her, without awaiting any reminder, five hundred
               fine florins of gold: which she, laughing at heart while the tears
               streamed from her eyes, took, Salabaetto trusting her mere promise
               of repayment. Now that the lady had gotten the money, the
               complexion of affairs began to alter; and whereas Salabaetto had
               been wont to have free access to her, whenever he was so minded,
               now for one reason or another he was denied admittance six times
               out of seven; nor did she greet him with the same smile, or shower
               on him the same caresses, or do him the same cheer as of yore. 
               So
               a month, two months, passed beyond the time when he was to have
               been repaid his money; and when he demanded it, he was put off
               with words. 
               Whereby Salabaetto, being now ware of the cheat
               which his slender wit had suffered the evil-disposed woman to put
               upon him, and also that, having neither writing nor witness against
               her, he was entirely at her mercy in regard of his claim, and being,
               moreover, ashamed to lodge any complaint with any one, as well
               because he had been forewarned of her character, as because he
               dreaded the ridicule to which his folly justly exposed him, was
               chagrined beyond measure, and inly bewailed his simplicity. 
               And
               his masters having written to him, bidding him change the money
               and remit it to them, he, being apprehensive that, making default as
               he must, he should, if he remained there, be detected, resolved to
               depart; and having taken ship, he repaired, not, as he should have
               done, to <span class="place">Pisa</span>, but to <span class="place">Naples</span>; 
               where at that time resided our gossip,
               Pietro dello Canigiano, treasurer of the Empress of <span class="place">Constantinople</span>,
               a man of great sagacity and acuteness, and a very great friend of
               Salabaetto and his kinsfolk; to whom trusting in his great discretion,
               Salabaetto after a while discovered his distress, telling him what he
               had done, and the sorry plight in which by consequence he stood,
               and craving his aid and counsel, that he might the more readily find
               means of livelihood there, for that he was minded never to go back
               to <span class="place">Florence</span>. Impatient to hear of such folly: 'Twas ill done of
               thee, quoth Canigiano, thou hast misbehaved thyself, wronged thy
               masters, and squandered an exorbitant sum in lewdness; however,
               'tis done, and we must consider of the remedy. And indeed, like
               the shrewd man that he was, he had already bethought him what
               was best to be done; and forthwith he imparted it to Salabaetto.
               Which expedient Salabaetto approving, resolved to make the adventure;
               and having still a little money, and being furnished with a loan
               by Canigiano, he provided himself with not a few bales well and
               closely corded, and bought some twenty oil-casks, which he filled,
               and having put all on shipboard, returned to <span class="place">Palermo</span>. There he
               gave the invoice of the bales, as also of the oil-casks, to the officers of
               the dogana, and having them all entered to his credit, laid them up
               in the store-rooms, saying that he purposed to leave them there until
               the arrival of other merchandise that he expected.
            </p>
            <p>Which Jancofiore learning, and being informed that the merchandise,
               that he had brought with him, was worth fully two thousand
               florins of gold, or even more, besides that which he expected, which
               was valued at more than three thousand florins of gold, bethought her
               that she had not aimed high enough, and that 'twere well to refund
               him the five hundred, if so she might make the greater part of the
               five thousand florins her own. Wherefore she sent for him, 
               and
               Salabaetto, having learned his lesson of cunning, waited on her.
               Feigning to know nought of the cargo he had brought with him, she
               received him with marvellous cheer, and began: Lo, now, if thou
               wast angry with me because I did not repay thee thy money in due
               time: 
               but Salabaetto interrupted her, saying with a laugh:
               Madam, 'tis true I was a little vexed, seeing that I would have
               plucked out my heart to pleasure you; but listen, and you shall learn
               the quality of my displeasure. Such and so great is the love I bear
               you, that I have sold the best part of all that I possess, whereby I
               have already in this port merchandise to the value of more than two
               thousand florins, and expect from the Levant other goods to the
               value of above three thousand florins, and mean to set up a warehouse
               in this city, and live here, to be ever near you, for that I deem myself
               more blessed in your love than any other lover that lives. 
               Whereupon:
               Harkye, Salabaetto, quoth the lady, whatever advantages
               thee is mighty grateful to me, seeing that I love thee more
               than my very life, and right glad am I that thou art come back with
               intent to stay, for I hope to have many a good time with thee; but
               something I must say to thee by way of excuse, for that, whilst thou
               wast thinking of taking thy departure, there were times when thou
               wast disappointed of seeing me, and others when thou hadst not as
               gladsome a welcome as thou wast wont to have, and therewithal I
               kept not the time promised for the repayment of thy money. 
               Thou
               must know that I was then in exceeding great trouble and tribulation,
               and whoso is thus bested, love he another never so much, cannot
               greet him with as gladsome a mien, or be as attentive to him, as he
               had life; 
               and thou must further know that 'tis by no means an easy
               matter for a lady to come by a thousand florins of gold: why, 'tis
               every day a fresh lie, and never a promise kept; and so we in our
               turn must needs lie to others; and 'twas for this cause, and not for
               any fault of mine, that I did not repay thee thy money; 
               however, I
               had it but a little while after thy departure, and had I known whither
               to send it, be sure I would have remitted it to thee; but, as that I
               wist not, I have kept it safe for thee. 
               She then produced a purse, in
               which were the very same coins that he had brought her, and placed
               it in his hand, saying: Count and see if there are five hundred
               there. 
               'Twas the happiest moment Salabaetto had yet known, as,
               having told them out, and found the sum exact, he made answer:
               Madam, I know that you say sooth, and what you have done
               abundantly proves it; wherefore, and for the love I bear you, I
               warrant you there is no sum you might ask of me on any occasion of
               need, with which, if 'twere in my power, I would not accommodate
               you; whereof, when I am settled here, you will be able to assure
               yourself.
            </p>
            <p>Having thus in words reinstated himself as her lover, he proceeded
               to treat her as his mistress, whereto she responded, doing all that was
               in her power to pleasure and honour him, and feigning to be in the
               last degree enamoured of him. 
               But Salabaetto, being minded to
               requite her guile with his own, went to her one evening, being bidden
               to sup and sleep with her, with an aspect so melancholy and dolorous,
               that he shewed as he had lief give up the ghost. Jancofiore, as she
               embraced and kissed him, demanded of him the occasion of his
               melancholy. 
               Whereto he, having let her be instant with him a
               good while, made answer: I am undone, for that the ship, having
               aboard her the goods that I expected, has been taken by the corsairs
               of <span class="place">Monaco</span>, and held to ransom in ten thousand florins of gold, of
               which it falls to me to pay one thousand, and I have not a denier, for
               the five hundred thou repaidst me I sent forthwith to <span class="place">Naples</span> to buy
               stuffs for this market, and were I to sell the merchandise I have here,
               as 'tis not now the right time to sell, I should scarce get half the
               value; nor am I as yet so well known here as to come by any to
               help me at this juncture, and so what to do or what to say I know
               not; but this I know that, if I send not the money without delay,
               my merchandise will be taken to <span class="place">Monaco</span>, and I shall never touch
               aught of it again. 
               Whereat the lady was mightily annoyed, being
               apprehensive of losing all, and bethought her how she might prevent
               the goods going to <span class="place">Monaco</span>: wherefore: God knows, quoth
               she, that for the love I bear thee I am not a little sorry for thee:
               but what boots it idly to distress oneself? Had I the money, God
               knows I would lend it thee forthwith, but I have it not. 
               One,
               indeed, there is that accommodated me a day or two ago with five
               hundred florins that I stood in need of, but he requires a heavy
               usance, not less than thirty on the hundred, and if thou shouldst
               have recourse to him, good security must be forthcoming. Now for
               my part I am ready, so I may serve thee, to pledge all these dresses,
               and my person to boot, for as much as he will lend thee thereon; but
               how wilt thou secure the balance?
            </p>
            <p>Salabaetto divined the motive that prompted her thus to accommodate
               him, and that she was to lend the money herself; which suiting
               his purpose well, he first of all thanked her, and then said that, being
               constrained by necessity, he would not stand out against exorbitant
               terms, adding that, as to the balance, he would secure it upon the
               merchandise that he had at the dogana by causing it to be entered in
               the name of the lender; but that he must keep the key of the storerooms,
               as well that he might be able to shew the goods, if requested,
               as to make sure that none of them should be tampered with or
               changed or exchanged. The lady said that this was reasonable, and
               that 'twas excellent security. So, betimes on the morrow, the lady
               sent for a broker, in whom she reposed much trust, and having talked
               the matter over with him, gave him a thousand florins of gold, which
               the broker took to Salabaetto, and thereupon had all that Salabaetto
               had at the dogana entered in his name; they then had the script and
               counterscript made out, and, the arrangement thus concluded, went
               about their respective affairs. Salabaetto lost no time in getting
               aboard a bark with his five hundred florins of gold, and being come
               to <span class="place">Naples</span>, sent thence a remittance which fully discharged his obligation
               to his masters that had entrusted him with the stuffs: he also
               paid all that he owed to Pietro dello Canigiano and all his other
               creditors, and made not a little merry with Canigiano over the trick
               he had played the Sicilian lady. He then departed from <span class="place">Naples</span>, and
               being minded to have done with mercantile affairs, betook him to
               <span class="place">Ferrara</span>.
            </p>
            <p>Jancofiore, surprised at first by Salabaetto's disappearance from
               <span class="place">Palermo</span>, waxed after a while suspicious; and, when she had waited
               fully two months, seeing that he did not return, she caused the broker
               to break open the store-rooms. And trying first of all the casks, she
               found them full of sea-water, save that in each there was perhaps a
               hog's-head of oil floating on the surface. Then undoing the bales,
               she found them all, save two that contained stuffs, full of tow, and
               in short their whole contents put together were not worth more than
               two hundred florins. Wherefore Jancofiore, knowing herself to
               have been outdone, regretted long and bitterly the five hundred
               florins of gold that she had refunded, and still more the thousand that
               she had lent, repeating many a time to herself: Who with a Tuscan
               has to do, Had need of eyesight quick and true. Thus, left with the
               loss and the laugh against her, she discovered that there were others
               as knowing as she.

         <div class="conclusion">
            <h3 class="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
            <p>No sooner was <span class="person">Dioneo</span>'s story ended, than <span class="person">Lauretta</span>, witting
               that therewith the end of her sovereignty was come, bestowed her
               meed of praise on Pietro Canigiano for his good counsel, and also on
               Salabaetto for the equal sagacity which he displayed in carrying it
               out, and then, taking off the laurel wreath, set it on the head of
               <span class="person">Emilia</span>, saying graciously: I know not, Madam, how debonair
               a queen you may prove, but at least we shall have in you a fair
               one. Be it your care, then, that you exercise your authority in a
               manner answerable to your charms. Which said, she resumed
               her seat.
            </p>
            <p>Not so much to receive the crown, as to be thus commended to
               her face and before the company for that which ladies are wont to
               covet the most, <span class="person">Emilia</span> was a little shamefast; a tint like that of the
               newly-blown rose overspread her face, and a while she stood silent
               with downcast eyes: then, as the blush faded away, she raised them;
               and having given her seneschal her commands touching all matters
               pertaining to the company, thus she spake: 
               Sweet my ladies, 'tis
               matter of common experience that, when the oxen have swunken a
               part of the day under the coercive yoke, they are relieved thereof and
               loosed, and suffered to go seek their pasture at their own sweet will
               in the woods; 
               nor can we fail to observe that gardens luxuriant with
               diversity of leafage are not less, but far more fair to see, than woods
               wherein is nought but oaks. Wherefore I deem that, as for so many
               days our discourse has been confined within the bounds of certain
               laws, 'twill be not only meet but profitable for us, being in need of
               relaxation, to roam a while, and so recruit our strength to undergo
               the yoke once more. 
               And therefore I am minded that to-morrow
               the sweet tenor of your discourse be not confined to any particular
               theme, but that you be at liberty to discourse on such wise as to each
               may seem best; for well assured am I that thus to speak of divers
               matters will be no less pleasurable than to limit ourselves to one topic;
               and by reason of this enlargement my successor in the sovereignty
               will find you more vigorous, and be therefore all the more forward
               to reimpose upon you the wonted restraint of our laws. 
               Having so
               said, she dismissed all the company until supper-time.
            </p>
            <p>All approved the wisdom of what the queen had said; and being
               risen betook them to their several diversions, the ladies to weave
               garlands and otherwise disport them, the young men to play and sing;
               and so they whiled away the hours until supper-time; which being
               come, they gathered about the fair fountain, and took their meal with
               gay and festal cheer. Supper ended, they addressed them to their
               wonted pastime of song and dance. 
               At the close of which the queen,
               notwithstanding the songs which divers of the company had already
               gladly accorded them, called for another from Pamfilo, who without
               the least demur thus sang:
            </p>
            <div class="song">
               	So great, O Love, the bliss
               	Through thee I prove, so jocund my estate,
               	That in thy flame to burn I bless my fate!
               
               	Such plenitude of joy my heart doth know
               	Of that high joy and rare,
               	Wherewith thou hast me blest,
               	As, bounds disdaining, still doth overflow,
               	And by my radiant air
               	My blitheness manifest;
               	For by thee thus possessed
               	With love, where meeter 'twere to venerate,
               	I still consume within thy flame elate.
               
               	Well wot I, Love, no song may e'er reveal,
               	Nor any sign declare
               	What in my heart is pent:
               	Nay, might they so, that were I best conceal,
               	Whereof were others ware,
               	'Twould serve but to torment
               	Me, whose is such content,
               	That weak were words and all inadequate
               	A tittle of my bliss to adumbrate.
               
               	Who would have dreamed that e'er in mine embrace
               	Her I should clip and fold
               	Whom there I still do feel,
               	Or as 'gainst her face e'er to lay my face
               	Attain such grace untold,
               	And unimagined weal?
               	Wherefore my bliss I seal
               	Of mine own heart within the circuit strait,
               	And still in thy sweet flame luxuriate.
               
            </div>
            <p>So ended Pamfilo his song: whereto all the company responded
               in full chorus; nor was there any but gave to its words an inordinate
               degree of attention, endeavóuring by conjecture to penetrate that
               which he intimated that 'twas meet he should keep secret. Divers
               were the interpretations hazarded, but all were wide of the mark.
               At length, however, the queen, seeing that ladies and men alike were
               fain of rest, bade all betake them to bed.
