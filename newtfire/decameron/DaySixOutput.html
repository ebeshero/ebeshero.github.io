            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>Still in mid heaven, the moon had lost her radiance, nor was any
               part of our world unillumined by the fresh splendour of the dawn, when, the queen
               being
               risen and having mustered her company, they hied them, gently sauntering, across the
               dewy
               mead some distance from the beautiful hill, conversing now of this, now of the other
               matter, canvassing the stories, their greater or less degree of beauty, and laughing
               afresh at divers of their incidents, until, the sun being now in his higher ascendant,
               they began to feel his heat, and turning back by common consent, retraced their steps
               to
               the palace, where, the tables being already set, and fragrant herbs and fair
               flowers
               strewn all about, they by the queen's command, before it should grow hotter, addressed
               themselves to their meal. So, having blithely
               breakfasted, they first of all sang some dainty and jocund ditties, and
               then, as they were severally minded, composed them to sleep or sat them down to chess
               or
               dice, while <span class="person">Dioneo</span> and <span class="person">Lauretta</span> fell a singing of Troilus and Cressida.
            </p>
            <p>The hour of session being come, they took their places, at the queen's summons, in
               their wonted order by the fountain; but, when the queen was about to call for the
               first
               story, that happened which had not happened before; to wit, there being a great uproar
               in
               the
               kitchen among the maids and men, the sound thereof reached the ears of the queen and
               all
               the company. Whereupon the queen called the seneschal and asked him who bawled
               so loud, and what was the occasion of the uproar. The seneschal made answer that 'twas some contention between <span class="person">Licisca</span> and <span class="person">Tindaro</span>; but the occasion he knew not,
               having but just come to quiet them, when he received her summons. The queen
               then bade him cause <span class="person">Licisca</span> and <span class="person">Tindaro</span> to come thither forthwith: so they came, and the
               queen enquired of them the cause of the uproar. <span class="person">Tindaro</span> was about to make
               answer, when <span class="person">Licisca</span>, who was somewhat advanced in years, and disposed to give herself
               airs, and heated to the strife of words, turned to <span class="person">Tindaro</span>,
               and scowling upon him said: Unmannerly varlet that makest bold to speak before me;
               leave me to tell the story. Then, turning to the queen, she said: 
               Madam, this
               fellow would fain instruct me as to Sicofante's wife, and--neither more or less--as
               if I
               had not known her well--would have me believe that, the first night that Sicofante
               lay
               with her, 'twas by force and not without effusion of blood that Master Yard made his
               way
               into Dusky Hill; which I deny, averring that he met with no resistance, but, on the
               contrary, with a hearty welcome on the part of the garrison. And such a
               numskull is he as fondly to believe that the girls are so simple as to let slip their
               opportunities, while they wait on the caprice of father or brothers, who six times
               out of
               	seven delay to marry them for three or four years after they should. Ay, ay indeed,
               doubtless they were well advised to tarry so long! Christ's faith! I should know the
               truth
               of what I swear; there is never a woman in my neighbour-hood whose husband had her
               virginity; and well I know how many and what manner of tricks our married dames play
               their
               husbands; and yet this booby would fain teach me to know women as if I were but born
               yesterday.
            </p>
            <p>While <span class="person">Licisca</span> thus spoke, the ladies laughed till all their teeth were ready to start
               from their heads. Six times at least the queen bade her be silent: but all in vain;
               she
               halted not till she had said all that she had a mind to. When she had done, the queen
               turned with a smile to <span class="person">Dioneo</span> saying: This is a question for thee to deal with, <span class="person">Dioneo</span>;
               so hold thyself in readiness to give final judgment upon it, when our stories are
               ended. Madam, replied <span class="person">Dioneo</span> forthwith, I give judgment without
               more ado: I say that <span class="person">Licisca</span> is in the right; I believe that 'tis even as she says, and
               that <span class="person">Tindaro</span> is a fool. Whereupon <span class="person">Licisca</span> burst out laughing, and turning
               to <span class="person">Tindaro</span>: Now did I not tell thee so? quoth she. Begone in
               
               God's name: dost think to know more than I, thou that art but a sucking babe?
               Thank God, I have not lived for nothing, not I.
               
               And had not the queen sternly bade her be silent, and make no more
               
               disturbance, unless she had a mind to be whipped, and sent both her and <span class="person">Tindaro</span> back to
               the kitchen, the whole day would have been spent in nought but listening to
               her. So <span class="person">Licisca</span> and <span class="person">Tindaro</span> having withdrawn, the queen charged <span class="person">Filomena</span> to
               tell the first story: and gaily thus <span class="person">Filomena</span> began.

            <p>'Tis no long time since there
               dwelt in our city a lady, noble,
               debonair and of excellent discourse, whom
               not a few of you may have
               seen or heard of, whose name--for such high
               qualities merit not
               oblivion--was Madonna Oretta, her husband being Messer
               Geri Spina.
               Now this lady, happening to be, as we are, in the country,
               moving
               from place to place for pleasure with a company of ladies and
               gentlemen,
               whom she had entertained the day before at breakfast at her
               
               house, and the place of their next sojourn, whither they were to go
               afoot, being some considerable distance off, one of the gentlemen
               of
               the company said to her: Madonna Oretta, so please you, I will
               
               carry you great part of the way a horseback with one of the finest
               stories
               in the world. Indeed, Sir, replied the lady, I pray
               you
               do
               so; and I shall deem it the greatest of favours. Whereupon the
               
               gentleman, who perhaps was no better master of his weapon than of
               his
               story, began a tale, which in itself was indeed excellent, but which,
               by
               repeating the same word three, four or six times, and now and
               again
               harking back, and saying: I said not well; and erring
               not seldom in
               the names, setting one in place of another, he utterly
               spoiled; besides
               which, his mode of delivery accorded very ill with
               the character of the
               persons and incidents: insomuch that Madonna
               Oretta, as she listened, did
               oft sweat, and was like to faint, as if she
               were ill and at the point of
               death. And being at length able to bear
               no more of it, witting that the
               gentleman had got into a mess and
               was not like to get out of it, she said
               pleasantly to him: Sir, this
               horse of yours trots too hard; I pray you
               be pleased to set me down.
               The gentleman, being perchance more quick
               of apprehension than
               he was skilful in narration, missed not the meaning
               of her sally, and
               took it in all good and gay humour. So, leaving
               unfinished the tale
               which he had begun, and so mishandled, he addressed
               himself to tell
               her other stories.

               </p>
            </div>
            <div class="frame">
               <p>Fair ladies, I cannot myself determine whether Nature or Fortune be the
                  	more at fault, the one in furnishing a noble soul with a vile body, or the other
                  in
                  	allotting a base occupation to a body endowed with a noble soul, whereof we may have
                  seen
                  	an example, among others, in our fellow-citizen, <span class="person">Cisti</span>; whom, furnished though he was with
                  	a most lofty soul, Fortune made a baker. And verily I should
                  	curse Nature and Fortune alike, did I not know that Nature is most discreet, and
                  that
                  	Fortune, albeit the foolish imagine her blind, has a thousand eyes. 
                  	For 'tis, I suppose, that, being wise above a little, they do as mortals
                  	ofttimes do, who, being uncertain as to their future, provide against contingencies
                  by
                  	burying their most precious treasures in the basest places in their houses, as being
                  the
                  	least likely to be suspected; whence, in the hour of their greatest need, they bring
                  them
                  	forth, the base place having kept them more safe than the dainty chamber would have
                  	done. And so these two arbitresses of the world not seldom hide
                  	their most precious commodities in the obscurity of the crafts that are reputed most
                  base,
                  	that thence being brought to light they may shine with a brighter splendour. 
                  	Whereof how in a trifling matter <span class="person">Cisti</span>, the baker, gave proof, restoring
                  	the eyes of the mind to Messer Geri Spina, whom the story of his wife, Madonna Oretta,
                  has
                  	brought to my recollection, I am minded to shew you in a narrative which shall be
                  of the
                  	briefest.
               </p>
            </div>
            <p>I say then that Pope Boniface, with whom
               Messer Geri Spina
               stood very high in favour and honour, having sent divers
               of his
               courtiers to <span class="place">Florence</span> as ambassadors to treat of certain matters of
               great
               moment, and they being lodged in Messer Geri's house, where he
               
               treated with them of the said affairs of the Pope, 'twas, for some
               reason
               or another, the wont of Messer Geri and the ambassadors of
               the Pope to
               pass almost every morning by <span class="place">Santa Maria Ughi</span>, where
               <span class="person">Cisti</span>, the baker, had
               his bakehouse, and plied his craft in person.
               Now, albeit Fortune had
               allotted him a very humble occupation, she
               had nevertheless prospered him
               therein to such a degree that he was
               grown most wealthy, and without ever
               aspiring to change it for
               another, lived in most magnificent style, having
               among his other good
               things a cellar of the best wines, white and red,
               that were to be found
               in <span class="place">Florence</span>, or the country parts; and marking
               Messer Geri and the
               ambassadors of the Pope pass every morning by his
               door, he bethought
               him that, as 'twas very hot, 'twould be a very
               courteous thing to give
               them to drink of his good wine; but comparing his
               rank with that
               of Messer Geri, he deemed it unseemly to presume to invite
               him,
               and cast about how he might lead Messer Geri to invite himself.
               So,
               wearing always the whitest of doublets and a spotless apron, that
               denoted
               rather the miller than the baker, he let bring, every morning
               about the
               hour that he expected Messer Geri and the ambassadors to
               pass by his door,
               a spick-and-span bucket of fresh and cool spring
               water, and a small
               Bolognese flagon of his good white wine, and two
               beakers that shone like
               silver, so bright were they: and there down
               he sat him, as they came by,
               and after hawking once or twice, fell a
               drinking his wine with such gusto
               that 'twould have raised a thirst
               in a corpse. Which Messer Geri having
               observed on two successive
               mornings, said on the third: What is't,
               <span class="person">Cisti</span>? Is't good?
               Whereupon <span class="person">Cisti</span> jumped up, and answered: Ay, Sir,
               good it is;
               but in what degree I might by no means make you understand,
               unless
               you tasted it. Messer Geri, in whom either the heat of the
               weather,
               or unwonted fatigue, or, perchance, the gusto with which he had
               
               seen <span class="person">Cisti</span> drink, had bred a thirst, turned to the ambassadors and
               said
               with a smile: Gentlemen, 'twere well to test the quality of
               this worthy
               man's wine: it may be such that we shall not repent
               us. And so in a
               body they came up to where <span class="person">Cisti</span> stood; who,
               having caused a goodly bench
               to be brought out of the bakehouse,
               bade them be seated, and to
               their servants, who were now coming
               forward to wash the beakers, said:
               Stand back, comrades, and
               leave this office to me, for I know as well
               how to serve wine as to
               bake bread; and expect not to taste a drop
               yourselves. Which said,
               he washed four fine new beakers with his own
               hands, and having
               sent for a small flagon of his good wine, he heedfully
               filled the
               beakers, and presented them to Messer Geri and his companions;
               
               who deemed the wine the best that they had drunk for a great while.
               So
               Messer Geri, having praised the wine not a little, came there to
               drink
               every morning with the ambassadors as long as they tarried
               with
               him.
            </p>
            <p>Now when the ambassadors had received their
               congè, and were
               about to depart, Messer Geri
               gave a grand banquet, to which he bade
               some of the most honourable of the
               citizens, and also <span class="person">Cisti</span>, who could
               by no means be induced to come.
               However, Messer Geri bade one
               of his servants go fetch a flask of <span class="person">Cisti</span>'s
               wine, and serve half a beaker
               thereof to each guest at the first course.
               The servant, somewhat
               offended, perhaps, that he had not been suffered to
               taste any of the
               wine, took with him a large flask, which <span class="person">Cisti</span> no sooner
               saw, than:
               Son, quoth he, Messer Geri does not send thee to
               me: and
               often as the servant affirmed that he did, he could get no
               other answer:
               wherewith he was fain at last to return to Messer Geri.
               Go, get
               thee back, said Messer Geri, and tell him that I do send
               thee
               to him, and if he answers thee so again, ask him, to whom then
               I
               send thee. So the servant came back, and said: <span class="person">Cisti</span>, Messer
               Geri
               does, for sure, send me to thee. Son, answered <span class="person">Cisti</span>,
               
               Messer
               Geri does, for sure, not send thee to me. To whom
               then, said
               the servant, does he send me? To <span class="place">Arno</span>,
               returned <span class="person">Cisti</span>.
               Which being reported by the servant to Messer Geri, the
               eyes of
               his mind were straightway opened, and: Let me see, quoth
               he
               to the servant, what flask it is thou takest there. And when he
               
               had seen it: <span class="person">Cisti</span> says sooth, he added; and having sharply
               chidden
               him, he caused him take with him a suitable flask, which
               when <span class="person">Cisti</span> saw:
               Now know I, quoth he, that 'tis indeed Messer
               Geri that sends
               thee to me, and blithely filled it. And having
               replenished the rundlet
               that same day with wine of the same quality,
               he had it carried with due
               care to Messer Geri's house, and followed
               after himself; where finding
               Messer Geri he said: I would not
               have you think, Sir, that I
               was appalled by the great flask your servant
               brought me this morning;
               'twas but that I thought you had forgotten
               that which by my little beakers
               I gave you to understand, when you
               were with me of late; to wit, that this
               is no table wine; and so
               wished this morning to refresh your memory. Now,
               however, being
               minded to keep the wine no longer, I have sent you all I
               have of it,
               to be henceforth entirely at your disposal. Messer Geri
               set great
               store by <span class="person">Cisti</span>'s gift, and thanked him accordingly, and ever
               made
               much of him and entreated him as his friend.

            <div class="frame">
               <p>Debonair my ladies, the excellency of wit, and our lack thereof, have
                  	been noted with no small truth first by <span class="person">Pampinea</span> and after her by <span class="person">Filomena</span>. To which topic
                  	'twere bootless to return: wherefore to that which has been said touching the nature
                  of
                  	wit I purpose but to add one word, to remind you that its bite should be as a sheep's

                  	and not as a dog's; for if it bite like a dog, 'tis no longer wit but discourtesy.

                  seem to

            </div>
            <p>While Messer Antonio d'Orso, a
               prelate both worthy and wise,
               was Bishop of <span class="place">Florence</span>, there came thither a
               Catalan gentleman,
               Messer Dego della Ratta by name, being King Ruberto's
               marshal.
               Now Dego being very goodly of person, and inordinately fond of women, it so befell
               that
               of the ladies of <span class="place">Florence</span> she that he regarded
               with especial favour was the very beautiful niece of a brother of the
               said
               bishop. And having learned that her husband, though of good
               family, was but a caitiff, and avaricious in the last degree, he
               struck
               a bargain with him that he should lie one night with the lady for
               
               five hundred florins of gold: whereupon he had the same number of
               
               popolinsA coin of the same size and design as the fiorino d'oro, but
               worth only two soldi. of silver, which were then current, gilded,
               and having
               lain
               with the lady, albeit against her will, gave them to her
               husband.
               Which coming to be generally known, the caitiff husband was left
               with the loss and the laugh against him; and the bishop, like a wise
               man,
               feigned to know nought of the affair. And so the bishop and
               the marshal
               being much together, it befell that on St. John's day, as
               they rode side
               by side down the street whence they start to run the
               palio,A sort of
               horse-race still in vogue at <span class="place">Siena</span>. and took
               note of the ladies,
               the bishop espied a young gentle-woman,
               whom this present pestilence has
               reft from us, Monna Nonna
               de' Pulci by name, a cousin of Messer Alesso
               Rinucci, whom you all
               must know; whom, for that she was lusty and fair,
               and of excellent
               discourse and a good courage, and but just settled with
               her husband
               in <span class="place">Porta San Piero</span>, the bishop presented to the marshal; and
               then,
               being close beside her, he laid his hand on the marshal's shoulder
               and
               said to her: Nonna, what thinkest thou of this gentleman? That
               thou mightst make a conquest of him? Which words the lady
               resented as
               a jibe at her honour, and like to tarnish it in the eyes
               of those, who
               were not a few, in whose hearing they were spoken
               Wherefore without
               bestowing a thought upon the vindication of her
               honour, but being minded
               to return blow for blow, she retorted
               hastily: Perchance, Sir, he might
               not make a conquest of me;
               but if he did so, I should want good money.
               The answer stung
               both the marshal and the bishop to the quick, the one as
               contriver
               of the scurvy trick played upon the bishop's brother in regard
               of his
               niece, the other as thereby outraged in the person of his
               brother's
               niece; insomuch that they dared not look one another in the
               face,
               but took themselves off in shame and silence, and said never a word
               more to her that day.
            </p>
            <p>In such a case, then, the lady having received
               a bite, 'twas allowable
               in her wittily to return it.

               may
               bear witness, has ever been a noble citizen of our city, open-handed
               and magnificent, and one that lived as a gentleman should with
               hounds and
               hawks, in which, to say nothing at present of more
               important matters, he
               found unfailing delight. Now, having one
               day hard by <span class="place">Peretola</span> despatched a
               crane with one of his falcons,
               finding it young and plump, he sent it to
               his excellent cook, a
               Venetian, <span class="person">Chichibio</span> by name, bidding him roast it
               for supper and
               make a dainty dish of it. <span class="person">Chichibio</span>, who looked, as he was,
               a
               very green-head, had dressed the crane, and set it to the fire and was
               
               cooking it carefully, when, the bird being all but roasted, and the
               fumes
               of the cooking very strong, it so chanced that a girl, <span class="person">Brunetta</span>
               by name,
               that lived in the same street, and of whom <span class="person">Chichibio</span> was
               greatly
               enamoured, came into the kitchen, and perceiving the smell
               and
               seeing the bird, began coaxing <span class="person">Chichibio</span> to give her a thigh.
               By way of
               answer <span class="person">Chichibio</span> fell a singing: You get it not from
               me, Madam
               <span class="person">Brunetta</span>, you get it not from me. Whereat Madam
               <span class="person">Brunetta</span> was offended,
               and said to him: By God, if thou givest
               it me not, thou shalt never
               have aught from me to pleasure thee.
               In short there was not a little
               altercation; and in the end <span class="person">Chichibio</span>,
               fain not to vex his mistress, cut
               off one of the crane's thighs, and
               gave it to her. So the bird was set
               before <span class="person">Currado</span> and some strangers
               that he had at table with him, and
               <span class="person">Currado</span>, observing that it had but
               one thigh, was surprised, and sent for
               <span class="person">Chichibio</span>, and demanded of
               him what was become of the missing thigh.
               Whereto the mendacious
               Venetian answered readily: The crane, Sir, has
               but one thigh and
               one leg. What the devil? rejoined <span class="person">Currado</span> in
               a rage: so the
               crane has but one thigh and one leg? thinkst thou I
               never saw crane
               before this? But <span class="person">Chichibio</span> continued: 'Tis even so
               as I say,
               Sir; and, so please you, I will shew you that so it is in the
               living
               bird. <span class="person">Currado</span> had too much respect for his guests to pursue
               the
               topic; he only said: Since thou promisest to shew me in the
               living
               bird what I have never seen or heard tell of, I bid thee do so
               to-morrow,
               and I shall be satisfied, but if thou fail, I swear to thee
               by the body of
               Christ that I will serve thee so that thou shalt ruefully
               remember my name
               for the rest of thy days.
            </p>
            <p>No more was said of the matter that
               evening, but on the morrow,
               at daybreak, <span class="person">Currado</span>, who had by no means
               slept off his wrath, got
               up still swelling therewith, and ordered his
               horses, mounted <span class="person">Chichibio</span>
               on a hackney, and saying to him: We shall
               soon see which of us
               lied yesternight, thou or I, set off with him for
               a place where there
               was much water, beside which there were always cranes
               to be seen
               about dawn. <span class="person">Chichibio</span>, observing that <span class="person">Currado</span>'s ire was
               unabated,
               and knowing not how to bolster up his lie, rode by <span class="person">Currado</span>'s
               side
               in a state of the utmost trepidation, and would gladly, had he been
               able, have taken to flight; but, as hemight not, he glanced, now
               ahead,
               now aback, now aside, and saw everywhere nought but cranes
               standing on two
               feet. However, as they approached the river, the
               very first thing they saw
               upon the bank was a round dozen of cranes
               standing each and all on one
               foot, as is their wont, when asleep.
               Which <span class="person">Chichibio</span> presently pointed out
               to <span class="person">Currado</span>, saying: Now
               may you see well enough, Sir, that 'tis true as
               I said yesternight, that
               the crane has but one thigh and one
               leg; mark but how they stand
               over there. Whereupon <span class="person">Currado</span>:
               Wait, quoth he, and I
               will shew thee that they have each thighs
               and legs twain. So,
               having drawn a little nigher to them, he
               ejaculated, Ohio! Which
               caused the cranes to bring each the other
               foot to the ground, and,
               after hopping a step or two, to take to flight.
               <span class="person">Currado</span> then turned
               to <span class="person">Chichibio</span>, saying: How now, rogue? art satisfied
               that the
               bird has thighs and legs twain? Whereto <span class="person">Chichibio</span>, all but
               beside
               himself with fear, made answer: Ay, Sir; but you cried not,
               oho! to our crane of yestereve: had you done so, it would have
               popped its
               other thigh and foot forth, as these have done. Which
               answer <span class="person">Currado</span>
               so much relished, that, all his wrath changed to jollity
               and laughter:
               <span class="person">Chichibio</span>, quoth he, thou art right, indeed I
               ought to have so
               done.
            </p>
            <p>Thus did <span class="person">Chichibio</span> by his ready and jocund retort arrest
               impending
               evil, and make his peace with his master.

            <p>Whereof a notable example is afforded by two of our citizens,
               of whom I purpose for a brief while to discourse. The one, Messer Forese da Rabatta
               by
               name, was short and deformed of person and withal flat-cheeked and flat-nosed, insomuch
               that never a <span class="person">Baroncio</span>The name of a Florentine family famous for the extraordinary
               ugliness of its men: whereby it came to pass that any grotesque or extremely ugly
               man was
               called a <span class="person">Baroncio</span>. Fanfani, Vocab. della Lingua Italiana,
               1891. had a visage so misshapen but his would have shewed as hideous beside it;
               yet so conversant was this man with the laws, that by not a few of those well able
               to
               form an opinion he was reputed a veritable storehouse of civil jurisprudence. 
               The other, whose name was Giotto, was of so excellent a wit that, let
               Nature, mother of all, operant ever by continual revolution of the heavens, fashion
               what
               she would, he with his style and pen and pencil would depict its like on such wise
               that
               it shewed not as its like, but rather as the thing itself, insomuch that the visual
               sense
               of men did often err in regard thereof, mistaking for real that which was but
               painted. Wherefore, having brought back to light that art which
               had for many ages lain buried beneath the blunders of those who painted rather to
               delight
               the eyes of the ignorant than to satisfy the intelligence of the wise, he may deservedly
               be called one of the lights that compose the glory of <span class="place">Florence</span>, and the more
               so, the more lowly was the spirit in which he won that glory, who, albeit he was,
               while
               he yet lived, the master of others, yet did ever refuse to be called their
               master. And this title that he rejected adorned him with a
               lustre the more splendid in proportion to the avidity with which it was usurped by
               those
               who were less knowing than he, or were his pupils. But for all
               the exceeding greatness of his art, yet in no particular had he the advantage of Messer
               Forese either in form or in feature. But to come to the story: 
               'Twas in <span class="place">Mugello</span> that Messer Forese, as likewise Giotto, had his
               country-seat, whence returning from a sojourn that he had made there during the summer
               vacation of the courts, and being, as it chanced, mounted on a poor jade of a draught
               horse, he fell in with the said Giotto, who was also on his way back to <span class="place">Florence</span> after a
               like sojourn on his own estate, and was neither better mounted, nor in any other wise
               better equipped, than Messer Forese. And so, being both old men, they jogged on together
               at a slow pace: and being surprised by a sudden shower, such as
               we frequently see fall in summer, they presently sought shelter in the house of a
               husbandman that was known to each of them, and was their friend. 
               But after a while, as the rain gave no sign of ceasing, and they had a
               mind to be at <span class="place">Florence</span> that same day, they borrowed of the husbandman two old cloaks of
               Romagnole cloth, and two hats much the worse for age (there being no better to be
               had),
               and resumed their journey.  Whereon they had not proceeded far,
               when, taking note that they were soaked through and through, and liberally splashed
               with
               the mud cast up by their nags' hooves (circumstances which are not of a kind to add
               to
               one's dignity), they, after long silence, the sky beginning to brighten a little,
               began
               to converse. And Messer Forese, as he rode and hearkened to
               Giotto, who was an excellent talker, surveyed him sideways, and from head to foot,
               and
               all over, and seeing him in all points in so sorry and scurvy a trim, and recking
               nought
               of his own appearance, broke into a laugh and said: Giotto,
               would e'er a stranger that met us, and had not seen thee before, believe, thinkst
               thou,
               that thou wert, as thou art, the greatest painter in the world. 
               Whereto Giotto answered promptly: Methinks, Sir, he might, if, scanning
               you, he gave you credit for knowing the A B C. Which
               hearing, Messer Forese recognized his error, and perceived that he had gotten as good
               as
               he brought.

            <p>'Tis no long time
               since there dwelt in our city a young man,
               Michele Scalza by name, the
               pleasantest and merriest fellow in the
               world, and the best furnished with
               quaint stories: for which reason
               the Florentine youth set great store on
               having him with them when
               they forgathered in company. Now it so befell
               that one day, he
               being with a party of them at <span class="place">Mont' Ughi</span>, they fell a
               disputing
               together on this wise; to wit, who were the best gentlemen and
               of
               the longest descent in <span class="place">Florence</span>. One said, the Uberti, another, the
               <span class="person">Lamberti</span>, or some other family, according to the predilection of the
               speaker. Whereat Scalza began to smile, and said: Now out
               upon you, out
               upon you, blockheads that ye are: ye know not what
               ye say. The best
               gentlemen and of longest descent in all the world
               and the <span class="place">Maremma</span> (let
               alone <span class="place">Florence</span>) are the <span class="person">Baronci</span> by the
               common consent of all
               phisopholers,In the Italian fisofoli: an
               evidently intentional distortion. and all that know them as I
               do;
               and lest you should otherwise conceive me, I say that 'tis of
               your
               neighbours the <span class="person">Baronci</span>Villani, Istorie
               Fiorentine, iv.

               Paradiso, xvi. 104,
               spell the name Barucci. of
               <span class="place">Santa Maria Maggiore</span> that I speak.
               Whereupon the young men,
               who had looked for somewhat else from
               him, said derisively: Thou dost
               but jest with us; as if we did not
               know the <span class="person">Baronci</span> as well as thou!
               Quoth Scalza: By the Gospels
               I jest not, but speak sooth; and if there
               is any of you will wager a
               supper to be given to the winner and six good
               fellows whom he
               shall choose, I will gladly do the like, and--what is
               more--I will
               abide by the decision of such one of you as you may
               choose. Then
               said one of them whose name was Neri Mannini: I am
               ready to
               adventure this supper; and so they agreed together that Piero
               di
               Fiorentino, in whose house they were, should be judge, and hied them
               to him followed by all the rest, eager to see Scalza lose, and triumph
               in
               his discomfiture, and told Piero all that had been said. Piero, who
               was a
               young man of sound sense, heard what Neri had to say; and
               then turning to
               Scalza: And how, quoth he, mayst thou make
               good what thou
               averrest? I will demonstrate it, returned
               Scalza, by
               reasoning so cogent that not only you, but he that denies
               it shall
               acknowledge that I say sooth. You know, and so they were
               saying but now,
               that the longer men's descent, the better is their
               gentility, and I say
               that the <span class="person">Baronci</span> are of longer descent, and thus
               better gentlemen than any
               other men. If, then, I prove to you that
               they are of longer descent than
               any other men, without a doubt the
               victory in this dispute will rest with
               me. Now you must know that
               when God made the <span class="person">Baronci</span>, He was but a novice
               in His art, of
               which, when He made the rest of mankind, He was already
               master.
               And to assure yourself that herein I say sooth, you have but to
               consider
               the <span class="person">Baronci</span>, how they differ from the rest of mankind, who all
               have faces well composed and duly proportioned, whereas of the
               <span class="person">Baronci</span> you
               will see one with a face very long and narrow, another
               with a face
               inordinately broad, one with a very long nose, another
               with a short one,
               one with a protruding and upturned chin, and
               great jaws like an ass's; and
               again there will be one that has one eye
               larger than its fellow, or set on
               a lower plane; so that their faces
               resemble those that children make when
               they begin to learn to draw.
               Whereby, as I said, 'tis plainly manifest
               that, when God made them,
               He was but novice in His art; and so they are of
               longer descent
               than the rest of mankind, and by consequence better
               gentlemen.
               By which entertaining argument Piero, the judge, and Neri
               who had
               wagered the supper, and all the rest, calling to mind the
               <span class="person">Baronci</span>'s
               ugliness, were so tickled, that they fell a laughing,
               and averred that
               Scalza was in the right, and that he had won the wager,
               and that
               without a doubt the <span class="person">Baronci</span> were the best gentlemen, and of the
               longest descent, not merely in <span class="place">Florence</span>, but in the world and the
               <span class="place">Maremma</span>
               to boot. Wherefore 'twas not without reason that
               Pamfilo, being minded to
               declare Messer Forese's ill-favouredness,
               said that he would have been
               hideous beside a <span class="person">Baroncio</span>.

               Rinaldo de' Pugliesi, found in her own
               chamber one night in the arms of
               Lazzarino de' Guazzagliotri, a
               handsome young noble of the same city, whom
               she loved even as
               herself. Whereat Rinaldo, very wroth, scarce refrained
               from falling
               upon them and killing them on the spot; and indeed, but that
               he
               doubted how he should afterwards fare himself, he had given way to
               the
               vehemence of his anger, and so done. Nor, though he so far
               mastered himself, could he forbear recourse to the statute, thereby
               to compass that which he might not otherwise lawfully compass, to
               wit, the
               death of his lady. Wherefore, having all the evidence
               needful to prove her
               guilt, he took no further counsel; but, as soon
               as 'twas day, he charged
               the lady and had her summoned. Like
               most ladies that are veritably
               enamoured, the lady was of a high
               courage; and, though not a few of her
               friends and kinsfolk sought
               to dissuade her, she resolved to appear to the
               summons, having liefer
               die bravely confessing the truth than basely flee
               and for defiance of
               the law live in exile, and shew herself unworthy of
               such a lover as
               had had her in his arms that night. And so, attended by
               many ladies
               and gentlemen, who all exhorted her to deny the charge, she
               came
               before the Podestà, and with a composed air and unfaltering
               voice
               asked whereof he would interrogate her. The Podestà,
               surveying her,
               and taking note of her extraordinary beauty, and exquisite
               manners,
               and the high courage that her words evinced, was touched with
               compassion
               for her, fearing she might make some admission, by reason
               whereof, to save his honour, he must needs do her to death. But
               still, as
               he could not refrain from examining her of that which was
               laid to her
               charge, he said: Madam, here, as you see, is your
               husband, Rinaldo, who
               prefers a charge against you, alleging that he
               has taken you in adultery,
               and so he demands that, pursuant to a
               statute which is in force here, I
               punish you with death: but this I
               may not do, except you confess;
               wherefore be very careful what you
               answer, and tell me if what your
               husband alleges against you be true.
               The lady, no wise dismayed, and
               in a tone not a little jocund, thus
               made answer: True it is, Sir, that
               Rinaldo is my husband, and
               that last night he found me in the arms of
               Lazzarino, in whose arms
               for the whole-hearted love that I bear him I have
               ofttimes lain; nor
               shall I ever deny it; but, as well I wot you know, the
               laws ought
               to be common and enacted with the common consent of all that
               they
               affect; which conditions are wanting to this law, inasmuch as it
               binds only us poor women, in whom to be liberal is much less reprehensible
               than it were in men; and furthermore the consent of no
               woman was--I say
               not had, but--so much as asked before 'twas
               made; for which reasons it
               justly deserves to be called a bad law.
               However, if in scathe of my body
               and your own soul, you are
               minded to put it in force, 'tis your affair;
               but, I pray you, go not
               on to try this matter in any wise,
               until you have granted me this
               trifling grace, to wit, to ask my husband
               if I ever gainsaid him, but
               did not rather accord him, when and so often
               as he craved it, complete
               enjoyment of myself. Whereto Rinaldo,
               without awaiting
               the Podestà's question, forthwith answered, that
               assuredly the lady
               had ever granted him all that he had asked of her for
               his gratification.
               Then, promptly continued the lady, if he has
               ever had of me as
               much as sufficed for his solace, what was I or am I to
               do with the
               surplus? Am I to cast it to the dogs? Is it not much better
               to
               bestow it on a gentleman that loves me more dearly than himself,
               than
               to suffer it to come to nought or worse? Which jocund
               question being
               heard by well-nigh all the folk of <span class="place">Prato</span>, who had
               flocked thither all agog
               to see a dame so fair and of such quality on
               her trial for such an
               offence, they laughed loud and long, and then
               all with one accord, and as
               with one voice, exclaimed that the lady
               was in the right and said well;
               nor left they the court until in
               concert with the Podestà they had
               so altered the harsh statute as
               that
               thenceforth only such women as
               should wrong their husbands for
               money should be within its
               purview.
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore Rinaldo left the court, discomfited of his
               foolish
               enterprise; and the lady blithe and free, as if rendered back to
               life
               from the burning, went home triumphant.

               </p>
            </div>
            <p>My story, then,
               is of one, Fresco da Celatico by name, that had a
               niece, Ciesca, as she
               was playfully called, who, being fair of face and
               person, albeit she had
               none of those angelical charms that we ofttimes
               see, had so superlative a
               conceit of herself, that she had contracted
               a habit of disparaging both
               men and women and all that she
               saw, entirely regardless of her own
               defects, though for odiousness,
               tiresomeness,
               and petulance she had not
               her match among women,
               insomuch that there was nought that could be done
               to her mind:
               besides which, such was her pride that had she been of the
               blood royal
               of <span class="place">France</span>, 'twould have been inordinate. And when she walked
               abroad, so fastidious was her humour, she was ever averting her
               head, as
               if there was never a soul she saw or met but reeked with a
               foul
               smell. Now one day--not to speak of other odious and tiresome
               ways that
               she had--it so befell that being come home, where
               Fresco was, she sat
               herself down beside him with a most languishing
               air, and did nought but
               fume and chafe. Whereupon: Ciesca,
               quoth he, what means this,
               that, though 'tis a feast-day, yet thou
               art come back so soon? She,
               all but dissolved with her vapourish
               humours, made answer: Why, the
               truth is, that I am come back
               early because never, I believe, were there
               such odious and tiresome
               men and women in this city as there are to-day. I
               cannot pass a
               soul in the street that I loathe not like ill-luck; and I
               believe there is
               not a woman in the world that is so distressed by the
               sight of odious
               people as I am; and so I am come home thus soon to avoid
               the sight
               of them. Whereupon Fresco, to whom his niece's bad manners
               were distasteful in the extreme: Daughter, quoth he, if thou
               loathe odious folk as much as thou sayest, thou wert best, so thou
               wouldst
               live happy, never to look at thyself in the glass. But she,
               empty as a
               reed, albeit in her own conceit a match for Solomon in
               wisdom, was as far
               as any sheep from apprehending the true sense of
               her uncle's jest; but
               answered that on the contrary she was minded
               to look at herself in the
               glass like otherwomen. And so she
               remained, and yet remains, hidebound in
               her folly.

            <p>You are to know, then, that in former times there obtained
               in
               our city customs excellent and commendable not a few, whereof today
               not one is left to us, thanks to the greed which, growing with
               the wealth
               of our folk, has banished them all from among us. One
               of which customs was
               that in divers quarters of <span class="place">Florence</span> the gentlemen
               that there resided would
               assemble together in companies of a
               limited number, taking care to include
               therein only such as might
               conveniently bear the expenses, and to-day one,
               another to-morrow,
               each in his turn for a day, would entertain the rest of
               the company;
               and so they would not seldom do honour to gentlemen from
               distant
               parts when they visited the city, and also to their
               fellow-citizens;
               and in like manner they would meet together at least once
               a year all
               in the same trim, and on the most notable days would ride
               together
               through the city, and now and again they would tilt together,
               more
               especially on the greater feasts, or when the city was rejoiced by
               tidings of victory or some other glad event. Among which companies
               was one
               of which Messer Betto Brunelleschi was the leading
               spirit, into which
               Messer Betto and his comrades had striven hard
               to bring Guido,
               son of Cavalcante de' Cavalcanti, and not without
               reason, inasmuch as,
               besides being one of the best logicians in the
               world, and an excellent
               natural philosopher (qualities of which the
               company made no great
               account), he was without a peer for gallantry
               and courtesy and excellence
               of discourse and aptitude for all matters
               which he might set his mind to,
               and that belonged to a gentleman;
               and therewithal he was very rich, and,
               when he deemed
               any worthy of honour, knew how to bestow it to the
               uttermost.
               But, as Messer Betto had never been able to gain him over, he
               and his comrades supposed that 'twas because Guido, being addicted
               to
               speculation, was thereby estranged from men. And, for that he
               was somewhat
               inclined to the opinion of the Epicureans, the vulgar
               averred that these
               speculations of his had no other scope than to
               prove that God did not
               exist. Now one day it so befell that, Guido
               being come, as was not seldom
               his wont, from <span class="place">Or San Michele</span> by
               the Corso degli Adimari as far as San
               Giovanni, around which were
               then the great tombs of marble that are to-day
               in <span class="place">Santa Reparata</span>,
               besides other tombs not a few, and Guido being between
               the columns
               of porphyry, that are there, and the tombs and the door of
               San
               Giovanni, which was locked, Messer Betto and his company came
               riding
               on to the piazza of <span class="place">Santa Reparata</span>, and seeing him among the
               tombs, said:
               Go we and flout him. So they set spurs to their
               horses, and making
               a mock onset, were upon him almost before he
               saw them. Whereupon:
               Guido, they began, thou wilt be
               none of our company; but, lo
               now, when thou hast proved that
               God does not exist, what wilt thou have
               achieved? Guido, seeing
               that he was surrounded, presently answered:
               Gentlemen, you
               may say to me what you please in your own house.
               Thereupon he
               laid his hand on one of the great tombs, and being very
               nimble,
               vaulted over it, and so evaded them, and went his way, while they
               remained gazing in one another's faces, and some said that he had
               taken
               leave of his wits, and that his answer was but nought, seeing
               that the
               ground on which they stood was common to them with the
               rest of the
               citizens, and among them Guido himself. But Messer
               Betto, turning to them:
               Nay but, quoth he, 'tis ye that have
               taken leave of your wits,
               if ye have not understood him; for meetly
               and in few words he has given us
               never so shrewd a reprimand;
               seeing that, if you consider it well, these
               tombs are the houses of the
               dead, that are laid and tarry
               therein; which he calls our house, to
               shew us that we, and all other
               simple, unlettered men, are, in comparison
               of him and the rest of the
               learned, in sorrier case than dead
               men, and so being here, we are in our
               own house. Then none was
               there but understood Guido's meaning and was
               abashed, insomuch
               that they flouted him no more, and thenceforth reputed
               Messer Betto
               a gentleman of a subtle and discerning wit.

            <p><span class="place">Certaldo</span>, as perchance you may have heard, is a town of
               Val
               d'Elsa within our country-side, which, small though it is, had in it
               aforetime people of rank and wealth. Thither, for that there he
               found good
               pasture, 'twas long the wont of one of the Friars of St.
               Antony to resort
               once every year, to collect the alms that fools gave
               them. Fra
               CipollaOnion.--so hight the friar--met with a hearty
               welcome,
               no less, perchance, by reason of his name than for other cause,
               the
               onions produced in that district being famous throughout <span class="place">Tuscany</span>.
               He
               was little of person, red-haired, jolly-visaged, and the very best
               of good
               fellows; and therewithal, though learning he had none, he
               was
               so excellent and ready a speaker that whoso knew him not would
               not only
               have esteemed him a great rhetorician, but would have
               pronounced him Tully
               himself or, perchance, Quintilian; and in all
               the country-side there was
               scarce a soul to whom he was not either
               gossip or friend or lover. Being
               thus wont from time to time to
               visit <span class="place">Certaldo</span>, the friar came there once
               upon a time in the month
               of August, and on a Sunday morning, all the good
               folk of the
               neighbouring farms being come to mass in the parish church, he
               took
               occasion to come forward and say: Ladies and gentlemen, you
               wot
               'tis your custom to send year by year to the poor of Baron
               Master St.
               Antony somewhat of your wheat and oats, more or less,
               according to the
               ability and the devoutness of each, that blessed St.
               Antony may save your
               oxen and asses and pigs and sheep from harm;
               and you are also accustomed,
               and especially those whose names are
               on the books of our confraternity, to
               pay your trifling annual dues.
               To collect which offerings, I am hither
               sent by my superior, to wit,
               Master Abbot; wherefore, with the blessing of
               God, after none,
               when you hear the bells ring, you will come out of the
               church to
               the place where in the usual way I shall deliver you my sermon,
               and
               you will kiss the cross; and therewithal, knowing, as I do, that you
               are one and all most devoted to Baron Master St. Antony, I will by
               way of
               especial grace shew you a most holy and goodly relic, which
               I brought
               myself from the <span class="place">Holy Land</span> overseas, which is none other
               than one of the
               feathers of the Angel Gabriel, which he left behind
               him in the room of the
               Virgin Mary, when he came to make her
               the annunciation in <span class="place">Nazareth</span>.
               And having said thus much, he
               ceased, and went on with the mass. Now among
               the many that
               were in the church, while Fra Cipolla made this speech, were
               two
               very wily young wags, the one Giovanni del Bragoniera by name,
               the
               other Biagio Pizzini; who, albeit they were on the best of
               terms with Fra
               Cipolla and much in his company, had a sly laugh
               together over the relic,
               and resolved to make game of him and his
               feather. So, having learned that
               Fra Cipolla was to breakfast that
               morning in the town with one of his
               friends, as soon as they knew
               that he was at table, down they hied them
               into the street, and to the
               inn where the friar lodged, having complotted
               that Biagio should
               keep the friar's servant in play, while Giovanni made
               search among
               the friar's goods and chattels for this feather, whatever it
               might be,
               to carry it off, that they might see how the friar
               would afterwards
               explain the matter to the people. Now Fra Cipolla had for
               servant
               one Guccio,Diminutive of Arriguccio. whom some called
               by way of
               addition Balena,Whale. others
               Imbratta,Filth. others again Porco,Hog. and who
               was
               such a rascallion that
               sure it is that Lippo TopoThe works of
               this painter seem to be
               lost. himself never painted his like.
               Concerning
               whom Fra Cipolla would ofttimes make merry with his
               familiars,
               saying: My servant has nine qualities, any one of
               which in Solomon,
               Aristotle, or Seneca, would have been enough to
               spoil all their virtue,
               wisdom and holiness. Consider, then, what
               sort of a man he must be that
               has these nine qualities, and yet never
               a spark of either virtue or wisdom
               or holiness. And being asked
               upon divers occasions what these nine
               qualities might be, he strung
               them together in rhyme, and answered: I
               will tell you. Lazy
               and uncleanly and a liar he is, Negligent, disobedient
               and foulmouthed,
               iwis, And reckless and witless and mannerless: and
               therewithal
               he has some other petty vices, which 'twere best to pass
               over.
               And the most amusing thing about him is, that, wherever he goes, he
               is for taking a wife and renting a house, and on the strength of a big,
               black, greasy beard he deems himself so very handsome a fellow and
               seductive, that he takes all the women that see him to be in love
               with
               him, and, if he were left alone, he would slip his girdle and run
               after
               them all. True it is that he is of great use to me, for that,
               be any
               minded to speak with me never so secretly, he must still have
               his share of
               the audience; and, if perchance aught is demanded of
               me, such is his fear
               lest I should be at a loss what answer to make,
               that he presently replies,
               ay or no, as he deems meet.
            </p>
            <p>Now, when he left this knave at the
               inn, Fra Cipolla had strictly
               enjoined him on no account to suffer any one
               to touch aught of his,
               and least of all his wallet, because it contained
               the holy things.
               But Guccio Imbratta, who was fonder of the kitchen than
               any
               nightingale of the green boughs, and most particularly if he espied
               there a maid, and in the host's kitchen had caught sight of a coarse
               fat
               woman, short and misshapen, with a pair of breasts that shewed
               as two
               buckets of muck and a face that might have belonged to one
               of the <span class="person">Baronci</span>,
               all reeking with sweat and grease and smoke, left
               Fra Cipolla's room and
               all his things to take care of themselves, and
               like a vulture
               swooping down upon the carrion, was in the kitchen
               in a trice. Where,
               though 'twas August, he sat him down by the
               fire, and fell a gossiping
               with Nuta--such was the maid's name--and
               told her that he was a gentleman
               by procuration,One of the humorous
               ineptitudes of which Boccaccio is
               fond. and had more
               florins than could be reckoned, besides those
               that he had to give
               away, which were rather more than less, and that he
               could do and
               say such things as never were or might be seen or heard
               forever, good
               Lord! and a day. And all heedless of his cowl, which had as
               much
               grease upon it as would have furnished forth the caldron of
               Altopascio,An
               abbey near Lucca famous for its doles of
               broth.
               and of his rent and patched doublet, inlaid with filth about
               the neck
               and under the armpits, and so stained that it shewed hues more
               various than ever did silk from Tartary or the Indies, and of his
               shoes
               that were all to pieces, and of his hose that were all in tatters,
               he told
               her in a tone that would have become the Sieur de Châtillon,
               that he
               was minded to rehabit her and put her in trim, and raise her
               from her
               abject condition, and place her where, though she would
               not have much to
               call her own, at any rate she would have hope of
               better things, with much
               more to the like effect; which professions,
               though made with every
               appearance of good will, proved, like most
               of his schemes, insubstantial
               as air, and came to nothing.
            </p>
            <p>Finding Guccio Porco thus occupied with
               Nuta, the two young
               men gleefully accounted their work half done, and,
               none gainsaying
               them, entered Fra Cipolla's room, which was open, and lit
               at once
               upon the wallet, in which was the feather. The wallet opened,
               they
               found, wrapt up in many folds of taffeta, a little casket, on
               opening
               which they discovered one of the tail-feathers of a parrot, which
               they
               deemed must be that which the friar had promised to shew the good
               folk of <span class="place">Certaldo</span>. And in sooth he might well have so imposed upon
               them,
               for in those days the luxuries of <span class="place">Egypt</span> had scarce been
               introduced into
               <span class="place">Tuscany</span>, though they have since been brought over
               in prodigious abundance,
               to the grave hurt of all <span class="place">Italy</span>. And though
               some conversance with them
               there was, yet in those parts folk knew
               next to nothing of them; but,
               adhering to the honest, simple ways of
               their forefathers, had not seen,
               nay for the most part had not so much
               as heard tell of, a
               parrot.
            </p>
            <p>So the young men, having found the feather, took it out
               with
               great glee; and looking around for something to replace
               it, they
               espied in a corner of the room some pieces of coal, wherewith
               they
               filled the casket; which they then closed, and having set the room
               in order exactly as they had found it, they quitted it unperceived,
               and
               hied them merrily off with the feather, and posted themselves
               where they
               might hear what Fra Cipolla would say when he found
               the coals in its
               stead. Mass said, the simple folk that were in the
               church went home with
               the tidings that the feather of the Angel
               Gabriel was to be seen after
               none; and this goodman telling his
               neighbour, and that goodwife her
               gossip, by the time every one had
               breakfasted, the town could scarce hold
               the multitude of men and
               women that flocked thither all agog to see this
               feather.
            </p>
            <p>Fra Cipolla, having made a hearty breakfast and had a
               little nap,
               got up shortly after none, and marking the great concourse of
               country-folk that were come to see the feather, sent word to Guccio
               Imbratta to go up there with the bells, and bring with him the
               wallet.
               Guccio, though 'twas with difficulty that he tore himself
               away from the
               kitchen and Nuta, hied him up with the things
               required; and though, when
               he got up, he was winded, for he was
               corpulent with drinking nought but
               water, he did Fra Cipolla's
               bidding by going to the church door and
               ringing the bells amain.
               When all the people were gathered about the door,
               Fra Cipolla, all
               unwitting that aught of his was missing, began his
               sermon, and after
               much said in glorification of himself, caused the
               confiteor to be recited
               with great solemnity, and two torches to be lit by
               way of preliminary
               to the shewing of the feather of the Angel Gabriel: he
               then bared
               his head, carefully unfolded the taffeta, and took out the
               casket,
               which, after a few prefatory words in praise and laudation of the
               Angel Gabriel and his relic, he opened. When he saw that it contained
               nought but coals, he did not suspect Guccio Balena of playing
               the trick,
               for he knew that he was not clever enough, nor did he
               curse him, that his
               carelessness had allowed another to play it, but he
               inly imprecated
               himself, that he had committed his things to the
               keeping of one whom he
               knew to be negligent and disobedient,
               reckless and witless.
               Nevertheless, he changed not colour, but
               with face and hands upturned to
               heaven, he said in a voice that all
               might hear: O God, blessed be Thy
               might for ever and ever.
               Then, closing the casket, and turning to the
               people: Ladies and
               gentlemen, he said, you are to
               know, that when I was yet a very
               young man, I was sent by my superior into
               those parts where the
               sun rises, and I was expressly bidden to search
               until I should find
               the Privileges of <span class="place">Porcellana</span>, which, though they cost
               nothing to seal,
               are of much more use to others than to us. On which
               errand I set
               forth, taking my departure from <span class="place">Venice</span>, and traversing the
               Borgo
               de' Greci,Perhaps part of the sesto of <span class="place">Florence</span> known
               as the
               Borgo, as the tradition of the commentators that the friar's
               itinerary is
               wholly
               Florentine is not to be lightly set aside. and
               thence on horseback
               the

               Cajolery. and <span class="place">Buffia</span>,The land of Drollery. countries
               thickly populated and with great nations, whence I pursued my
               journey to
               <span class="place">Menzogna</span>,The land of Lies. where I met with many of
               our own
               brethren,
               and of other religious not a few, intent one and all on
               eschewing
               hardship for the love of God, making little account of others'
               toil, so
               they might ensue their own advantage, and paying in nought but

               and
               so I came to the land of <span class="place">Abruzzi</span>, where the men and women
               go in pattens on
               the mountains, and clothe the hogs with their own
               entrails;A
               reference to sausage-making. and a little further on
               I
               found folk
               that carried bread in
               staves and wine in
               sacks.I.e. cakes fashioned in a hollow ring,
               and wines in leathern bottles. And leaving them, I arrived at the
               mountains of the Bachi,Grubs. where all the waters
               run
               downwards. In
               short I penetrated so far that I came at last to <span class="place">India</span>

               allusion to the shapeless fish, so called, which was

               merchant,
               whom I found there cracking nuts, and selling the shells by
               retail!
               However, not being able to find that whereof I was in quest,
               because
               from thence one must travel by water, I turned back, and so came
               at length to the <span class="place">Holy Land</span>, where in summer cold bread costs four
               deniers,
               and hot bread is to be had for nothing. And there I found

               the most
               worshipful
               Patriarch of <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>; who out of respect for the
               habit that I have
               ever worn, to wit, that of Baron Master St. Antony, was
               pleased to
               let me see all the holy relics that he had by him, which were
               so
               many, that, were I to enumerate them all, I should not come to the
               end
               of them in some miles. However, not to disappoint you, I will
               tell you a
               few of them. In the first place, then, he shewed me the
               finger of the Holy
               Spirit, as whole and entire as it ever was, and the
               tuft of the Seraph
               that appeared to St. Francis, and one of the nails
               of the Cherubim, and
               one of the ribs of the Verbum Caro hie thee

               casement,fatti alle finestre, a subterfuge for
               factum est. and some of the vestments of the
               Holy Catholic
               Faith, and some of the rays of the star that appeared to the
               Magi in
               the East, and a phial of the sweat of St. Michael a battling with
               the
               Devil and the jaws of death of St. Lazarus, and other relics. And
               for
               that I gave him a liberal supply of the
               acclivitiespiagge,
               jocularly for
               pagine: doubtless some mighty tome of school divinity

               Morello in the vulgar and some chapters of
               <span class="place">Caprezio</span>, of which he
               had long been in quest, he was pleased to let me
               participate in his
               holy relics, and gave me one of the teeth of the Holy
               Cross, and in
               a small phial a bit of the sound of the bells of Solomon's
               temple, and
               this feather of the Angel Gabriel, whereof I have
               told you, and one
               of the pattens of San Gherardo da Villa Magna, which,
               not long ago,
               I gave at <span class="place">Florence</span> to Gherardo di Bonsi, who holds him in
               prodigious
               veneration. He also gave me some of the coals with which the
               most blessed martyr, St. Lawrence, was roasted. All which things
               I
               devoutly brought thence, and have them all safe. True it is that
               my
               superior has not hitherto permitted me to shew them, until he
               should be
               certified that they are genuine. However, now that this
               is avouched by
               certain miracles wrought by them, of which we have
               tidings by letter from
               the Patriarch, he has given me leave to shew
               them. But, fearing to trust
               them to another, I always carry them
               with me; and to tell you the truth I
               carry the feather of the Angel
               Gabriel, lest it should get spoiled, in a
               casket, and the coals, with
               which St. Lawrence was roasted, in another
               casket; which caskets
               are so like the one to the other, that not seldom I
               mistake one for
               the other, which has befallen me on this occasion; for,
               whereas I
               thought to have brought with me the casket wherein is the
               feather,
               I have brought instead that which contains the coals. Nor deem l
               this a mischance; nay, methinks, 'tis by interposition of God, and
               that He
               Himself put the casket of coals in my hand, for I mind me
               that the feast
               of St. Lawrence falls but two days hence. Wherefore
               God, being minded that
               by shewing you the coals, with which he
               was roasted, I should rekindle in
               your souls the devotion that you
               ought to feel towards him, guided my
               hand, not to the feather which
               I meant to take, but to the blessed coals
               that were extinguished by
               the humours that exuded from that most holy
               body. And so,
               blessed children, bare your heads and devoutly draw nigh to
               see
               them. But first of all I would have you know, that whoso has the
               sign
               of the cross made upon him with these coals, may live secure for
               the whole
               of the ensuing year, that fire shall not touch him, that he
               feel it
               not.
            </p>
            <p>Having so said, the friar, chanting a hymn in praise of
               St.
               Lawrence, opened the casket, and shewed the coals. Whereon the
               
               foolish crowd gazed a while in awe and reverent wonder, and then
               came
               pressing forward in a mighty throng about Fra Cipolla with
               offerings
               beyond their wont, each and all praying him to touch them
               with the coals.
               Wherefore Fra Cipolla took the coals in his hand,
               and set about making on
               their white blouses, and on their doublets,
               and on the veils
               of the women crosses as big as might be, averring
               the while that whatever
               the coals might thus lose would be made
               good to them again in the casket,
               as he had often proved. On this
               wise, to his exceeding great profit, he
               marked all the folk of <span class="place">Certaldo</span>
               with the cross, and, thanks to his ready
               wit and resource, had his
               laugh at those, who by robbing him of the
               feather thought to make
               a laughing-stock of him. They, indeed, being among
               his hearers,
               and marking his novel expedient, and how voluble he was, and
               what
               a long story he made of it, laughed till they thought their jaws
               would break; and, when the congregation was dispersed, they went
               up to
               him, and never so merrily told him what they had done, and
               returned him
               his feather; which next year proved no less lucrative
               to him than that day
               the coals had been.

            <h3 class="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Immense was the delight and
               diversion which this story afforded
               to all the company alike, and great
               and general was the laughter over
               Fra Cipolla, and more especially at his
               pilgrimage, and the relics, as
               well those that he had but seen as those
               that he had brought back
               with him. Which being ended, the queen, taking
               note that therewith
               the close of her sovereignty was come, stood up, took
               off the
               crown, and set it on <span class="person">Dioneo</span>'s head, saying with a laugh: 'Tis
               time, <span class="person">Dioneo</span>, that thou prove the weight of the burden of having
               ladies to
               govern and guide. Be thou king then; and let thy rule
               be such that, when
               'tis ended, we may have cause to commend it.
               <span class="person">Dioneo</span> took the crown,
               and laughingly answered: Kings worthier
               far than I you may well have
               seen many a time ere now--I speak
               of the kings in chess; but let me have
               of you that obedience which
               is due to a true king, and of a surety I will
               give you to taste of that
               solace, without which perfection of joy there
               may not be in any
               festivity. But enough of this: I will govern as best I
               may. Then,
               as was the wont, he sent for the seneschal, and gave him
               particular
               instruction how to order matters during the term of his
               sovereignty,
               which done, he said: Noble ladies, such and so diverse has
               been
               our discourse of the ways of men and their various fortunes, that
               but for the visit that we had a while ago from Madam <span class="person">Licisca</span>, who
               by what
               she said has furnished me with matter of discourse for
               to-morrow, I doubt
               I had been not a little put to it to find a theme.
               You heard how she said
               that there was not a woman in her neighbourhood
               whose husband had her
               virginity; adding that well she knew
               how many and what manner
               of tricks they, after marriage, played
               their husbands. The first count we
               may well leave to the girls
               whom it concerns; the second, methinks, should
               prove a diverting
               topic: wherefore I ordain that, taking our cue from
               Madam <span class="person">Licisca</span>,
               we discourse to-morrow of the tricks that, either for love
               or for their
               deliverance from peril, ladies have heretofore played their
               husbands,
               and whether they were by the said husbands detected or no.
               To
               discourse of such a topic some of the ladies deemed unmeet for them,
               and besought the king to find another theme. But the king made
               answer:
               Ladies, what manner of theme I have prescribed I know
               as well as you,
               nor was I to be diverted from prescribing it by that
               which you now think
               to declare unto me, for I wot the times are
               such that, so only men and
               women have a care to do nought that is
               unseemly, 'tis allowable to them to
               discourse of what they please.
               For in sooth, as you must know, so out of
               joint are the times that
               the judges have deserted the judgment-seat, the
               laws are silent, and
               ample licence to preserve his life as best he may is
               accorded to each
               and all. Wherefore, if you are somewhat less strict of
               speech than is
               your wont, not that aught unseemly in act may follow, but
               that you
               may afford solace to yourselves and others, I see not how you can
               be
               open to reasonable censure on the part of any. Furthermore, nought
               that has been said from the first day to the present moment has,
               methinks,
               in any degree sullied the immaculate honour of your
               company, nor, God
               helping us, shall aught ever sully it. Besides,
               who is there that knows
               not the quality of your honour? which
               were proof, I make no doubt, against
               not only the seductive influence
               of diverting discourse, but even the
               terror of death. And,
               to tell you the truth, whoso wist that you refused
               to discourse of
               these light matters for a while, would be apt to suspect
               that 'twas
               but for that you had yourselves erred in like sort. And truly
               a
               goodly honour would you confer upon me, obedient as I have ever
               been to
               you, if after making me your king and your lawgiver, you
               were to refuse to
               discourse of the theme which I prescribe. Away,
               then, with this scruple
               fitter for low minds than yours, and let each
               study how she may give us a
               goodly story, and Fortune prosper her
               therein.
            </p>
            <p>So spake the
               king, and the ladies, hearkening, said that, even as
               he would, so it
               should be: whereupon he gave all leave to do as they
               might be
               severally minded until the supper-hour. The sun was still
               quite high in
               the heaven, for they had not enlarged in their discourse:
               wherefore,
               <span class="person">Dioneo</span> with the other gallants being set to play
               at dice, Elisa called the
               other ladies apart, and said: There is a
               nook hard by this place, where
               I think none of you has ever been:
               'tis called the Ladies' Vale: whither,
               ever since we have been here,
               I have desired to take you, but time meet I
               have not found until today,
               when the sun is still so high: if, then, you
               are minded to visit
               it, I have no manner of doubt that, when you are
               there, you will be
               very glad you came. The ladies answered that they
               were ready,
               and so, saying nought to the young men, they summoned one of
               their maids, and set forth; nor had they gone much more than a
               mile, when
               they arrived at the Vale of Ladies. They entered it by
               a very strait
               gorge, through which there issued a rivulet, clear as
               crystal, and a
               sight, than which nought more fair and pleasant,
               especially at that time
               when the heat was great, could be imagined,
               met their eyes. Within the
               valley, as one of them afterwards told
               me, was a plain about half-a-mile
               in circumference, and so exactly
               circular that it might have been
               fashioned according to the compass,
               though it seemed a work of Nature's
               art, not man's: 'twas girdled
               about by six hills of no great height, each
               crowned with a palace
               that shewed as a goodly little castle. The slopes of
               the hills were
               graduated from summit to base after the manner of the
               successive
               tiers, ever abridging their circle, that we see in our
               theatres; and as
               many as fronted the southern rays were all planted so
               close with
               vines, olives, almond-trees, cherry-trees, fig-trees and other
               fruit-bearing
               trees not a few, that there was not a hand's-breadth of
               vacant space. Those that fronted the north were in like manner
               covered
               with copses of oak saplings, ashes and other trees, as green
               and straight
               as might be. Besides which, the plain, which was shut
               in on all sides save
               that on which the ladies had entered, was full of
               firs, cypresses, and
               bay-trees, with here and there a pine, in order
               and symmetry so meet and
               excellent as had they been planted by an
               artist, the best that might be
               found in that kind; wherethrough,
               even when the sun was in the zenith,
               scarce a ray of light might
               reach the ground, which was all one lawn of
               the finest turf, pranked
               with the hyacinth and divers other flowers. Add
               to which--nor was
               there aught there more delightsome--a rivulet that,
               issuing from one
               of the gorges between two of the hills,
               descended over ledges of
               living rock, making, as it fell, a murmur most
               gratifying to the ear,
               and, seen from a distance, shewed as a spray of
               finest, powdered
               quick-silver, and no sooner reached the little plain,
               than 'twas
               gathered into a tiny channel, by which it sped with great
               velocity
               to the middle of the plain, where it formed a diminutive lake,
               like
               the fishponds that townsfolk sometimes make in their gardens, when
               they have occasion for them. The lake was not so deep but that a
               man might
               stand therein with his breast above the water; and so
               clear, so pellucid
               was the water that the bottom, which was of
               the finest gravel, shewed so
               distinct, that one, had he wished, who
               had nought better to do, might have
               counted the stones. Nor was it
               only the bottom that was to be seen, but
               such a multitude of fishes,
               glancing to and fro, as was at once a delight
               and a marvel to behold.
               Bank it had none, but its margin was the lawn, to
               which it imparted
               a goodlier freshness. So much of the water as it might
               not contain
               was received by another tiny channel, through which, issuing
               from
               the vale, it glided swiftly to the plain below.
            </p>
            <p>To which
               pleasaunce the damsels being come surveyed it with
               roving glance, and
               finding it commendable, and marking the lake
               in front of them, did, as
               'twas very hot, and they deemed themselves
               secure from observation,
               resolve to take a bath. So, having bidden
               their maid wait and keep watch
               over the access to the vale, and give
               them warning, if haply any should
               approach it, they all seven undressed
               and got into the water, which to the
               whiteness of their flesh
               was even such a veil as fine glass is to the
               vermeil of the rose. They,
               being thus in the water, the clearness of which
               was thereby in no
               wise affected, did presently begin to go hither and
               thither after the
               fish, which had much ado where to bestow themselves so
               as to
               escape out of their hands. In which diversion they spent some time,
               and caught a few, and then they hied them out of the water and
               dressed
               them again, and bethinking them that 'twas time to return
               to the palace,
               they began slowly sauntering thither, dilating much as
               they went upon the
               beauty of the place, albeit they could not extol
               it more than they had
               already done. 'Twas still quite early when
               they reached the palace, so
               that they found the gallants yet at play
               where they had left them. To whom
               quoth <span class="person">Pampinea</span> with a
               smile: We have stolen a march upon you
               to-day. So,
               replied <span class="person">Dioneo</span>, 'tis with you do
               first and say after? Ay, my
               lord, returned <span class="person">Pampinea</span>, and told
               him at large whence they came,
               and what the place was like, and how far
               'twas off, and what they
               had done. What she said of the beauty of the spot
               begat in the king
               a desire to see it: wherefore he straightway ordered
               supper, whereof
               when all had gaily partaken, the three gallants parted
               from the ladies
               and hied them with their servants to the vale, where none
               of them
               had ever been before, and, having marked all its beauties,
               extolled it
               as scarce to be matched in all the world. Then, as the hour
               was
               very late, they did but bathe, and as soon as they had resumed their
               clothes, returned to the ladies, whom they found dancing a carol to
               an air
               that <span class="person">Fiammetta</span> sang, which done, they conversed of the
               Ladies' Vale,
               waxing eloquent in praise thereof: insomuch that the
               king called the
               seneschal, and bade him have some beds made ready
               and carried thither on
               the morrow, that any that were so minded
               might there take their siesta. He
               then had lights and wine and
               comfits brought; and when they had taken a
               slight refection, he
               bade all address them to the dance. So at his behest
               Pamfilo led a
               dance, and then the king, turning with gracious mien to
               Elisa:
               Fair damsel, quoth he, 'twas thou to-day didst me this
               honour
               of the crown; and 'tis my will that thine to-night be the honour
               or
               the song; wherefore sing us whatsoever thou hast most lief.
               That gladly will I, replied Elisa smiling; and thus with dulcet
               voice began:
            </p>
            <div class="song">If of thy talons,
               Love, be quit I may,
               I deem it scarce can be
               But other fangs
               I may elude for aye.Service I took with thee, a tender
               maid,
               In thy war thinking perfect peace to find,
               And all my
               arms upon the ground I laid,
               Yielding myself to thee with trustful
               mind:
               Thou, harpy-tyrant, whom no faith may bind,
               Eftsoons
               didst swoop on me,
               And with thy cruel claws mad'st me thy
               prey.Then thy poor captive, bound with many a
               chain,
               Thou tookst, and gav'st to him, whom fate did
               call
               Hither my death to be; for that in pain
               
               And
               bitter tears I waste away, his thrall:
               Nor heave I e'er a sigh, or
               tear let fall,
               So harsh a lord is he,
               That him inclines a jot
               my grief to allay.My prayers upon the idle air are
               spent:
               He hears not, will not hear; wherefore in vain
               The
               more each hour my soul doth her torment;
               Nor may I die, albeit to
               die were gain.
               Ah! Lord, have pity of my bitter pain!
               Help
               have I none but thee;
               Then take and bind and at my feet him
               lay.But if thou wilt not, do my soul but loose
               From
               hope, that her still binds with triple chain.
               Sure, O my Lord, this
               prayer thou'lt not refuse:
               The which so thou to grant me do but
               deign,
               I look my wonted beauty to regain,
               And banish
               misery
               With roses white and red bedecked and
               gay.
            </div>
            <p>So with a most piteous sigh ended Elisa her song,
               whereat all
               wondered exceedingly, nor might any conjecture wherefore she
               so
               sang. But the king, who was in a jolly humour, sent for <span class="person">Tindaro</span>,
               and
               bade him out with his cornemuse, and caused them tread many a
               measure
               thereto, until, no small part of the night being thus spent,
               he gave leave
               to all to betake them to rest.
