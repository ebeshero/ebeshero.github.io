            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>The sun was already trailing the new day in his
               wake of light,
               and the birds, blithely chanting their lays among the green boughs,
               carried the tidings to the ear, when with one accord all the ladies and
               the three young men arose, and entered the gardens, where for no
               little time they found their delight in sauntering about the dewy
               meads, straying hither and thither, culling flowers, and weaving them
               into fair garlands. The day passed like its predecessor;
               they breakfasted
               in the shade, and danced and slept until noon, when they rose,
               and, at their queen's behest, assembled in the cool meadow, and sat
               them down in a circle about her. Fair and very debonair she shewed,
               crowned with her laurel wreath, as for a brief space she scanned the
               company, and then bade <span class="person">Neifile</span> shew others the way with a story.
               <span class="person">Neifile</span> made no excuse, and gaily thus began.

               <p>Often has it happened, dearest ladies, that one who has studied
                  to raise a laugh at others' expense, especially in regard of things
                  worthy to be had in reverence, has found the laugh turn against himself,
                  and sometimes to his loss: as, in obedience to the queen's
                  command, and by way of introducing our theme, I am about to shew
                  you, by the narrative of an adventure which befell one of our own
                  citizens, and after a course of evil fortune had an entirely unexpected
                  and very felicitous issue.
               </p>
            </div>
            <p>Not long ago there was at <span class="place">Treviso</span> a German, named Arrigo, a
               poor man who got his living as a common hired porter, but, though
               of so humble a condition, was respected by all, being accounted not
               only an honest but a most holy man; insomuch that, whether truly
               or falsely I know not, the Trevisans affirm, that on his decease all
               the bells of the cathedral of <span class="place">Treviso</span> began to toll of their own accord.
               Which being accounted a miracle, this Arrigo was generally reputed
               a saint; and all the people of the city gathered before the house where
               his body lay, and bore it, with a saint's honours, into the cathedral,
               and brought thither the halt and paralytic and blind, and others
               afflicted with disease or bodily defects, as hoping that by contact with
               this holy body they would all be healed. The people thus tumultuously
               thronging the church, it so chanced that there arrived in
               <span class="place">Treviso</span> three of our own citizens, of whom one was named <span class="person">Stecchi</span>,
               another <span class="person">Martellino</span>, and the third <span class="person">Marchese</span>; all three being men
               whose habit it was to frequent the courts of the nobles and afford
               spectators amusement by assuming disguises and personating other
               men. Being entire strangers to the place, and seeing everybody
               running to and fro, they were much astonished, and having learned
               the why and wherefore, were curious to go see what was to be seen.
               So at the inn, where they put up, <span class="person">Marchese</span> began: We would
               fain go see this saint; but for my part I know not how we are to
               reach the spot, for I hear the piazza is full of Germans and other
               armed men, posted there by the Lord who rules here to prevent an
               uproar, and moreover the church, so far as one may learn, is so full
               of folk that scarce another soul may enter it. 
               Whereupon <span class="person">Martellino</span>,
               who was bent on seeing what was to be seen, said: Let not
               this deter us; I will assuredly find a way of getting to the saint's
               body.
               How? rejoined <span class="person">Marchese</span>. 
               I will tell you, replied <span class="person">Martellino</span>;
               I will counterfeit a paralytic, and thou wilt support me on one side
               and <span class="person">Stecchi</span> on the other, as if I were not able to go alone, and so
               you will enter the church, making it appear as if you were leading
               me up to the body of the saint that he may heal me, and all that see
               will make way and give us free passage. 
               <span class="person">Marchese</span> and <span class="person">Stecchi</span>
               approved the plan; so all three forthwith left the inn and repaired to
               a lonely place, where <span class="person">Martellino</span> distorted his hands, his fingers, his
               arms, his legs, and also his mouth and eyes and his entire face in a
               manner horrible to contemplate; so that no stranger that saw him
               could have doubted that he was impotent and paralysed in every part
               of his body. In this guise <span class="person">Marchese</span> and <span class="person">Stecchi</span> laid hold of him,
               and led him towards the church, assuming a most piteous air, and
               humbly beseeching everybody for God's sake to make way for them.
               Their request was readily granted; and, in short, observed by all,
               and crying out at almost every step, make way, make way, they
               reached the place where St. Arrigo's body was laid. Whereupon
               some gentlemen who stood by hoisted <span class="person">Martellino</span> on to the saint's
               body, that thereby he might receive the boon of health. There he
               lay still for a while, the eyes of all in the church being riveted upon
               him in expectation of the result; then, being a very practised performer,
               he stretched, first, one of his fingers, next a hand, afterwards
               an arm, and so forth, making as if he gradually recovered the use of
               all his natural powers. Which the people observing raised such a
               clamour in honour of St. Arrigo that even thunder would have been
               inaudible.
               Now it chanced that hard by stood a Florentine, who
               knew <span class="person">Martellino</span> well, though he had failed to recognise him, when,
               in such strange guise, he was led into the church; but now, seeing
               him resume his natural shape, the Florentine recognised him, and at
               once said with a laugh: God's curse upon him. Who that saw
               him come but would have believed that he was really paralysed?
               These words were overheard by some of the Trevisans, who began
               forthwith to question the Florentine. How? said they; was
               he then not paralysed? 
               No, by God! returned the Florentine;
               he has always been as straight as any of us; he has merely
               shewn you that he knows better than any man alive how to play
               this trick of putting on any counterfeit semblance that he chooses.
               Thereupon the Trevisans, without further parley, made a rush, clearing
               the way and crying out as they went: Seize this traitor who
               mocks at God and His saints; who, being no paralytic, has come
               hither in the guise of a paralytic to deride our patron saint and us.
               So saying, they laid hands on him, dragged him down from where
               he stood, seized him by the hair, tore the clothes from his back, and
               fell to beating and kicking him, so that it seemed to him as if all the
               world were upon him. He cried out: Pity, for God's sake, and
               defended himself as best he could: all in vain, however; the press
               became thicker and thicker moment by moment. Which <span class="person">Stecchi</span> and
               <span class="person">Marchese</span> observing began to say one to the other that 'twas a bad
               business; yet, being apprehensive on their own account, they did not
               venture to come to his assistance, but cried out with the rest that he
               ought to die, at the same time, however, casting about how they
               might find the means to rescue him from the hands of the people,
               who would certainly have killed him, but for a diversion which
               <span class="person">Marchese</span> hastily effected. The entire posse of the signory being just
               outside, he ran off at full speed to the Podestà's lieutenant, and
               said
               to him: Help, for God's sake; there is a villain here that has cut
               my purse with full a hundred florins of gold in it; prithee have him
               arrested that I may have my own again. Whereupon, twelve
               sergeants or more ran forthwith to the place where hapless <span class="person">Martellino</span>
               was being carded without a comb, and, forcing their way with the
               utmost difficulty through the throng, rescued him all bruised and
               battered from their hands, and led him to the palace; whither he was
               followed by many who, resenting what he had done, and hearing that
               he was arrested as a cutpurse, and lacking better pretext for harassing
               him, began one and all to charge him with having cut their purses.
               All which the deputy of the Podestà had no sooner heard, than, being
               a harsh man, he straightway took <span class="person">Martellino</span> aside and began to
               examine him. <span class="person">Martellino</span> answered his questions in a bantering tone,
               making light of the arrest; whereat the deputy, losing patience, had
               him bound to the strappado, and caused him to receive a few hints of
               the cord with intent to extort from him a confession of his guilt, by
               way of preliminary to hanging him. Taken down from the strappado,
               and questioned by the deputy if what his accusers said were
               true, <span class="person">Martellino</span>, as nothing was to be gained by denial, answered:
               My lord, I am ready to confess the truth; let but my accusers say,
               each of them, when and where I cut his purse, and I will tell you
               what I have and what I have not done. 
               So be it, said the deputy,
               and caused a few of them to be summoned. Whereupon <span class="person">Martellino</span>,
               being charged with having cut this, that or the other man's purse
               eight, six or four days ago, while others averred that he had cut their
               purses that very day, answered thus: My lord, these men lie in
               the throat, and for token that I speak true, I tell you that, so far from
               having been here as long as they make out, it is but very lately that
               I came into these parts, where I never was before; and no sooner was
               I come, than, as my ill-luck would have it, I went to see the body of
               this saint, and so have been carded as you see; and that what I say
               is true, his Lordship's intendant of arrivals, and his book, and also my
               host may certify. Wherefore, if you find that even so it is as I say,
               hearken not to these wicked men, and spare me the torture and death
               which they would have you inflict. 
               In this posture of affairs
               <span class="person">Marchese</span> and <span class="person">Stecchi</span>, learning that the Podestà's deputy was dealing
               rigorously with <span class="person">Martellino</span>, and had already put him to the strappado,
               grew mightily alarmed. We have made a mess of it, they said to
               themselves; we have only taken him out of the frying-pan to toss
               him into the fire. 
               So, hurrying hither and thither with the utmost
               zeal, they made diligent search until they found their host, and told
               him how matters stood. The host had his laugh over the affair, and
               then brought them to one Sandro <span class="person">Agolanti</span>, who dwelt in <span class="place">Treviso</span>
               and had great interest with the Lord of the place. The host laid the
               whole matter before Sandro, and, backed by <span class="person">Marchese</span> and <span class="person">Stecchi</span>,
               besought him to undertake <span class="person">Martellino</span>'s cause. Sandro, after many
               a hearty laugh, hied him to the Lord, who at his instance sent for
               <span class="person">Martellino</span>. The messengers found <span class="person">Martellino</span> still in his shirt before
               the deputy, at his wits' end, and all but beside himself with fear,
               because the deputy would hear nothing that he said in his defence.
               Indeed, the deputy, having a spite against Florentines, had quite
               made up his mind to have him hanged; he was therefore in the last
               degree reluctant to surrender him to the Lord, and only did so upon
               compulsion. Brought at length before the Lord, <span class="person">Martellino</span> detailed
               to him the whole affair, and prayed him as the greatest of favours to
               let him depart in peace. The Lord had a hearty laugh over the
               adventure, and bestowed a tunic on each of the three. So, congratulating
               themselves on their unexpected deliverance from so great
               a peril, they returned home safe and sound.

            <p>Know, then, that in the time of the Marquis Azzo da <span class="place">Ferrara</span>, a
               merchant, Rinaldo d'Asti by name, having disposed of certain affairs
               which had brought him to <span class="place">Bologna</span>, set his face homeward, and
               having left <span class="place">Ferrara</span> behind him was on his way to <span class="place">Verona</span>, when he
               fell in with some men that looked like merchants, but were in truth
               robbers and men of evil life and condition, whose company he
               imprudently joined, riding and conversing with them. They, perceiving
               that he was a merchant, and judging that he must have
               money about him, complotted to rob him on the first opportunity;
               and to obviate suspicion they played the part of worthy and reputable
               men, their discourse of nought but what was seemly and honourable
               and leal, their demeanour at once as respectful and as cordial as they
               could make it; so that he deemed himself very lucky to have met
               with them, being otherwise alone save for a single mounted servant.
               
               Journeying
               thus, they conversed, after the desultory manner of travellers,
               of divers matters, until at last they fell a talking of the prayers which
               men address to God, and one of the robbers--there were three of
               them--said to Rinaldo: And you, gentle sir, what is your wonted
               orison when you are on your travels? 
               Rinaldo answered: Why,
               to tell the truth, I am a man unskilled, unlearned in such matters,
               and few prayers have I at my command, being one that lives in the
               good old way and lets two soldi count for twenty-four deniers;
               nevertheless it has always been my custom in journeying to say of a
               morning, as I leave the inn, a paternoster and an avemaria for the
               souls of the father and mother of St. Julian, after which I pray God
               and St. Julian to provide me with a good inn for the night. And
               many a time in the course of my life have I met with great perils by
               the way, and evading them all have found comfortable quarters for
               the night: whereby my faith is assured, that St. Julian, in whose
               honour I say my paternoster, has gotten me this favour of God; nor
               should I look for a prosperous journey and a safe arrival at night, if
               I had not said it in the morning. 
               Then said his interrogator:
               And did you say it this morning? 
               Whereto Rinaldo answered, Troth, did I, 
               which caused the other, who by this time knew
               what course matters would take, to say to himself: 'Twill prove
               to have been said in the nick of time; for if we do not miscarry, I
               take it thou wilt have but a sorry lodging. 
               Then turning to
               Rinaldo he said: I also have travelled much, and never a prayer
               have I said, though I have heard them much commended by many;
               nor has it ever been my lot to find other than good quarters for the
               night; it may be that this very evening you will be able to determine
               which of us has the better lodging, you that have said the paternoster,
               or I that have not said it. True, however, it is that in its stead I
               am accustomed to say the 'Dirupisti,' or the 'Intemerata,' or the
               'De profundis,' which, if what my grandmother used to say is to be
               believed, are of the greatest efficacy. 
               So, talking of divers matters,
               and ever on the look-out for time and place suited to their evil
               purpose, they continued their journey, until towards evening, some
               distance from <span class="place">Castel Guglielmo</span>, as they were about to ford a stream,
               these three ruffians, profiting by the lateness of the hour, and the
               loneliness and straitness of the place, set upon Rinaldo and robbed
               him, and leaving him afoot and in his shirt, said by way of adieu:
               Go now, and see if thy St. Julian will provide thee with good
               lodging to-night; our saint, we doubt not, will do as much by us;
               and so crossing the stream, they went their way. Rinaldo's servant,
               coward that he was, did nothing to help his master when he saw him
               attacked, but turned his horse's head, and was off at a smart pace;
               nor did he draw rein until he was come to <span class="place">Castel Guglielmo</span>; where,
               it being now evening, he put up at an inn and gave himself no
               further trouble. Rinaldo, left barefoot, and stripped to his shirt,
               while the night closed in very cold and snowy, was at his wits' end,
               and shivering so that his teeth chattered in his head, began to peer
               about, if haply he might find some shelter for the night, that so
               he might not perish with the cold; but, seeing none (for during a
               recent war the whole country had been wasted by fire), he set off for
               <span class="place">Castel Guglielmo</span>, quickening his pace by reason of the cold.
               Whether his servant had taken refuge in <span class="place">Castel Guglielmo</span> or
               elsewhere, he knew not, but he thought that, could he but enter
               the town, God would surely send him some succour. However,
               dark night overtook him while he was still about a mile from the
               castle; so that on his arrival he found the gates already locked and
               the bridges raised, and he could not pass in. Sick at heart, disconsolate
               and bewailing his evil fortune, he looked about for some
               place where he might ensconce himself, and at any rate find shelter
               from the snow. And by good luck he espied a house, built with a
               balcony a little above the castle-wall, under which balcony he
               purposed to shelter himself until daybreak. Arrived at the spot, he
               found beneath the balcony a postern, which, however, was locked;
               and having gathered some bits of straw that lay about, he placed
               them in front of the postern, and there in sad and sorrowful plight
               took up his quarters, with many a piteous appeal to St. Julian, whom
               he reproached for not better rewarding the faith which he reposed
               in him. St. Julian, however, had not abandoned him, and in due
               time provided him with a good lodging.
            </p>
            <p>There was in the castle a widow lady of extraordinary beauty
               (none fairer) whom Marquis Azzo loved as his own life, and kept
               there for his pleasure. She lived in the very same house beneath
               the balcony of which Rinaldo had posted himself. Now it chanced
               that that very day the Marquis had come to <span class="place">Castel Guglielmo</span> to
               pass the night with her, and had privily caused a bath to be made
               ready, and a supper suited to his rank, in the lady's own house.
               The arrangements were complete; and only the Marquis was stayed
               for, when a servant happened to present himself at the castle-gate,
               bringing tidings for the Marquis which obliged him suddenly to take
               horse. He therefore sent word to the lady that she must not wait
               for him, and forthwith took his departure. The lady, somewhat
               disconsolate, found nothing better to do than to get into the bath
               which had been intended for the Marquis, sup and go to bed: so
               into the bath she went. The bath was close to the postern on the
               other side of which hapless Rinaldo had ensconced himself, and thus
               the mournful and quavering music which Rinaldo made as he
               shuddered in the cold, and which seemed rather to proceed from a
               stork's beak than from the mouth of a human being, was audible to
               the lady in the bath. She therefore called her maid, and said to
               her: Go up and look out over the wall and down at the postern,
               and mark who is there, and what he is, and what he does there.
               The maid obeyed, and, the night being fine, had no difficulty in
               making out Rinaldo as he sate there, barefoot, as I have said, and in
               his shirt, and trembling in every limb. So she called out to him,
               to know who he was. Rinaldo, who could scarcely articulate for
               shivering, told as briefly as he could, who he was, and how and why
               he came to be there; which done, he began piteously to beseech
               her not, if she could avoid it, to leave him there all night to perish of
               cold. The maid went back to her mistress full of pity for Rinaldo,
               and told her all she had seen and heard. The lady felt no less pity
               for Rinaldo; and bethinking her that she had the key of the postern
               by which the Marquis sometimes entered when he paid her a secret
               visit, she said to the maid: Go, and let him in softly; here is
               this supper, and there will be none to eat it; and we can very well
               put him up for the night. 
               Cordially commending her mistress's
               humanity, the maid went and let Rinaldo in, and brought him to the
               lady, who, seeing that he was all but dead with cold, said to him:
               Quick, good man, get into that bath, which is still warm.
               Gladly he did so, awaiting no second invitation, and was so much
               comforted by its warmth that he seemed to have passed from death
               to life. The lady provided him with a suit of clothes, which
               had been worn by her husband shortly before his death, and which,
               when he had them on, looked as if they had been made for him. So
               he recovered heart, and, while he awaited the lady's commands, gave
               thanks to God and St. Julian for delivering him from a woful night
               and conducting him, as it seemed, to comfortable quarters.
            </p>
            <p>The lady meanwhile took a little rest, after which she had a
               roaring fire put in one of her large rooms, whither presently she
               came, and asked her maid how the good man did. The maid
               replied: Madam, he has put on the clothes, in which he shews
               to advantage, having a handsome person, and seeming to be a worthy
               man, and well-bred. 
               Go, call him then, said the lady, tell him
               to come hither to the fire, and we will sup; for I know that he has
               not supped. 
               Rinaldo, on entering the room and seeing the lady,
               took her to be of no small consequence. He therefore made her a
               low bow, and did his utmost to thank her worthily for the service
               she had rendered him. His words pleased her no less than his
               person, which accorded with what the maid had said: so she made
               him heartily welcome, installed him at his ease by her side before the
               fire, and questioned him of the adventure which had brought him
               thither. Rinaldo detailed all the circumstances, of which the lady
               had heard somewhat when Rinaldo's servant made his appearance at
               the castle. She therefore gave entire credence to what he said, and
               told him what she knew about his servant, and how he might easily
               find him on the morrow. She then bade set the table, which done,
               Rinaldo and she washed their hands and sate down together to sup.
               Tall he was and comely of form and feature, debonair and gracious
               of mien and manner, and in his lusty prime. The lady had eyed
               him again and again to her no small satisfaction, and, her wantonness
               being already kindled for the Marquis, who was to have come
               to lie with her, she had let Rinaldo take the vacant place in her
               mind. So when supper was done, and they were risen from the
               table, she conferred with her maid, whether, after the cruel trick
               played upon her by the Marquis, it were not well to take the good
               gift which Fortune had sent her. The maid knowing the bent of
               her mistress's desire, left no word unsaid that might encourage her
               to follow it. Wherefore the lady, turning towards Rinaldo, who
               was standing where she had left him by the fire, began thus: 
               So!
               Rinaldo, why still so pensive? Will nothing console you for the
               loss of a horse and a few clothes? Take heart, put a blithe face on
               it, you are at home; nay more, let me tell you that, seeing you in
               those clothes which my late husband used to wear, and taking you
               for him, I have felt, not once or twice, but perhaps a hundred times
               this evening, a longing to throw my arms round you and kiss you;
               and, in faith, I had so done, but that I feared it might displease you.
               Rinaldo, hearing these words, and marking the flame which shot
               from the lady's eyes, and being no laggard, came forward with open
               arms, and confronted her and said: Madam, I am not unmindful
               that I must ever acknowledge that to you I owe my life, in regard
               of the peril whence you rescued me. If then there be any way in
               which I may pleasure you, churlish indeed were I not to devise it.
               So you may even embrace and kiss me to your heart's content, and
               I will embrace and kiss you with the best of good wills. There
               needed no further parley. The lady, all aflame with amorous desire,
               forthwith threw herself into his arms, and straining him to her
               bosom with a thousand passionate embraces, gave and received a
               thousand kisses before they sought her chamber. There with all
               speed they went to bed, nor did day surprise them until again and
               again and in full measure they had satisfied their desire. With the
               first streaks of dawn they rose, for the lady was minded that none
               should surmise aught of the affair. So, having meanly habited
               Rinaldo, and replenished his purse, she enjoined him to keep the
               secret, shewed him the way to the castle, where he was to find his
               servant, and let him out by the same postern by which he had
               entered. When it was broad day the gates were opened, and
               Rinaldo, passing himself off as a traveller from distant parts, entered
               the castle, and found his servant. Having put on the spare suit
               which was in his valise, he was about to mount the servant's horse,
               when, as if by miracle, there were brought into the castle the three
               gentlemen of the road who had robbed him the evening before,
               having been taken a little while after for another offence. Upon
               their confession Rinaldo's horse was restored to him, as were also his
               clothes and money; so that he lost nothing except a pair of garters,
               of which the robbers knew not where they had bestowed them.
               Wherefore Rinaldo, giving thanks to God and St. Julian, mounted
               his horse, and returned home safe and sound, and on the morrow the
               three robbers kicked heels in the wind.

            <p>There was formerly in our city a knight, by name Messer
               Tedaldo, of the <span class="person">Lamberti</span>, according to some, or, as others say, of the
               <span class="person">Agolanti</span>
               family, perhaps for no better reason than that the occupation
               of his sons was similar to that which always was and is the
               occupation of the <span class="person">Agolanti</span>. However, without professing to
               determine which of the two houses he belonged to, I say, that he
               was in his day a very wealthy knight, and had three sons, the eldest
               being by name Lamberto, the second Tedaldo, and the third
               Agolante. Fine, spirited young men were they all, though the
               eldest was not yet eighteen years old when their father, Messer
               Tedaldo, died very rich, leaving to them as his lawful heirs the
               whole of his property both movable and immovable. Finding
               themselves thus possessed of great wealth, both in money and in
               lands and chattels, they fell to spending without stint or restraint,
               indulging their every desire, maintaining a great establishment, and
               a large and well-filled stable, besides dogs and hawks, keeping ever
               open house, scattering largesses, jousting, and, not content with these
               and the like pastimes proper to their condition, indulging every
               appetite natural to their youth. They had not long followed this
               course of life before the cash left them by their father was exhausted;
               and, their rents not sufficing to defray their expenditure, they began
               to sell and pledge their property, and disposing of it by degrees, one
               item to-day and another to-morrow, they hardly perceived that they
               were approaching the verge of ruin, until poverty opened the eyes
               which wealth had fast sealed. So one day Lamberto called his
               brothers to him, reminded them of the position of wealth and
               dignity which had been theirs and their father's before them, and
               shewed them the poverty to which their extravagance had reduced
               them, and adjured them most earnestly that, before their destitution
               was yet further manifest, they should all three sell what little
               remained to them and depart thence; which accordingly they did.
               Without leave-taking, or any ceremony, they quitted <span class="place">Florence</span>; nor
               did they rest until they had arrived in <span class="place">England</span> and established
               themselves in a small house in <span class="place">London</span>, where, by living with extreme
               parsimony and lending at exorbitant usances, they prospered so well
               that in the course of a few years they amassed a fortune; and so,
               one by one, they returned to <span class="place">Florence</span>, purchased not a few of their
               former estates besides many others, and married. The management
               of their affairs in <span class="place">England</span> where they continued their business of
               usurers, they left to a young nephew, Alessandro by name, while,
               heedless
               alike of the teaching of experience and of marital and
               parental duty, they all three launched out at <span class="place">Florence</span> into more
               extravagant expenditure than before, and contracted debts on all
               hands and to large amounts. This expenditure they were enabled
               for some years to support by the remittances made by Alessandro,
               who, to his great profit, had lent money to the barons on the
               security of their castles and rents.
            </p>
            <p>While the three brothers thus continued to spend freely, and,
               when short of money, to borrow it, never doubting of help from
               <span class="place">England</span>, it so happened that, to the surprise of everybody, there
               broke out in <span class="place">England</span> a war between the King and his son, by which
               the whole island was divided into two camps; whereby Alessandro
               lost all his mortgages of the baronial castles and every other source of
               income whatsoever. However, in the daily expectation that peace
               would be concluded between the King and his son, Alessandro,
               hoping that in that event all would be restored to him, principal and
               interest, tarried in the island; and the three brothers at <span class="place">Florence</span> in
               no degree retrenched their extravagant expenditure, but went on
               borrowing from day to day. Several years thus passed; and, their
               hopes being frustrated, the three brothers not only lost credit, but,
               being pressed for payment by their creditors, were suddenly arrested,
               and, their property proving deficient, were kept in prison for the
               balance, while their wives and little children went into the country
               parts, or elsewhere, wretchedly equipped, and with no other prospect
               than to pass the rest of their days in destitution. Alessandro, meanwhile,
               seeing that the peace, which he had for several years awaited
               in <span class="place">England</span>, did not come, and deeming that he would hazard his
               life to no purpose by tarrying longer in the country, made up his
               mind to return to <span class="place">Italy</span>. He travelled at first altogether alone; but
               it so chanced that he left Bruges at the same time with an abbot,
               habited in white, attended by a numerous retinue, and preceded by
               a goodly baggage-train. Behind the abbot rode two greybeard
               knights, kinsmen of the King, in whom Alessandro recognised
               acquaintances, and, making himself known to them, was readily
               received into their company. As thus they journeyed together,
               Alessandro softly asked them who the monks were that rode in front
               with so great a train, and whither they were bound. 
               The foremost
               rider, replied one of the knights, is a young kinsman of ours, the
               newly-elected
               abbot of one of the greatest abbeys of <span class="place">England</span>; and
               as he is not of legal age for such a dignity, we are going with him to
               <span class="place">Rome</span> to obtain the Holy Father's dispensation and his confirmation
               in the office; but this is not a matter for common talk. 
               Now the
               new abbot, as lords are wont to do when they travel, was sometimes
               in front, sometimes in rear of his train; and thus it happened that,
               as he passed, he set eyes on Alessandro, who was still quite young,
               and very shapely and well-favoured, and as courteous, gracious and
               debonair as e'er another. The abbot was marvellously taken with
               him at first sight, having never seen aught that pleased him so much,
               called him to his side, addressed him graciously, and asked him who
               he was, whence he came, and whither he was bound. Alessandro
               frankly told all about himself, and having thus answered the abbot's
               questions, placed himself at his service as far as his small ability
               might extend. The abbot was struck by his easy flow of apt speech,
               and observing his bearing more closely, he made up his mind that,
               albeit his occupation was base, he was nevertheless of gentle blood,
               which added no little to his interest in him; and being moved to
               compassion by his misfortunes, he gave him friendly consolation,
               bidding him be of good hope, that if he lived a worthy life, God
               would yet set him in a place no less or even more exalted than that
               whence Fortune had cast him down, and prayed him to be of his
               company as far as <span class="place">Tuscany</span>, as both were going the same way.
               Alessandro thanked him for his words of comfort, and professed
               himself ready to obey his every command.
            </p>
            <p>So fared on the abbot, his mind full of new ideas begotten by the
               sight of Alessandro, until some days later they came to a town which
               was none too well provided with inns; and, as the abbot must needs
               put up there, Alessandro, who was well acquainted with one of the
               innkeepers, arranged that the abbot should alight at his house, and
               procured him the least discomfortable quarters which it could afford.
               He thus became for the nonce the abbot's seneschal, and being very
               expert for such office, managed excellently, quartering the retinue in
               divers parts of the town. So the abbot supped, and, the night being
               far spent, all went to bed except Alessandro, who then asked the host
               where he might find quarters for the night. 
               In good sooth, I
               know not, replied the host; thou seest that every place is occupied,
               and that I and my household must lie on the benches. However,
               in the abbot's chamber there are some corn-sacks. I can shew
               thee the way thither, and lay a bit of a bed upon them, and there, an
               it like thee, thou mayst pass the night very well. How sayst
               thou? 
               said Alessandro; in the abbot's chamber, which thou
               knowest is small, so that there was not room for any of the monks
               to sleep there? Had I understood this when the curtains were
               drawn, I would have quartered his monks on the corn-sacks, and
               slept myself where the monks sleep. 
               'Tis even so, however,
               replied the host, and thou canst, if thou wilt, find excellent quarters
               there: the abbot sleeps, the curtains are close drawn; I will go
               in softly and lay a small bed there, on which thou canst sleep.
               Alessandro, satisfied that it might be managed without disturbing the
               abbot, accepted the offer, and made his arrangements for passing the
               night as quietly as he could.
            </p>
            <p>The abbot was not asleep; his mind being far too overwrought
               by certain newly-awakened desires. He had heard what had passed
               between Alessandro and the host, he had marked the place where
               Alessandro had lain down, and in the great gladness of his heart had
               begun thus to commune with himself: God has sent me the
               opportunity of gratifying my desire; if I let it pass, perchance it
               will be long before another such opportunity occurs. 
               So, being
               minded by no means to let it slip, when all was quiet in the inn, he
               softly called Alessandro, and bade him lie down by his side. Alessandro
               made many excuses, but ended by undressing and obeying;
               whereupon the abbot laid a hand on Alessandro's breast, and began to
               caress him just as amorous girls do their lovers; whereat Alessandro
               marvelled greatly, doubting the abbot was prompted to such caresses
               by a shameful love. Which the abbot speedily divined, or else surmised
               from some movement on Alessandro's part, and, laughing,
               threw off a chemise which she had upon her, and taking Alessandro's
               hand, laid it on her bosom, saying: Alessandro, dismiss thy foolish
               thought, feel here, and learn what I conceal. 
               Alessandro obeyed,
               laying a hand upon the abbot's bosom, where he encountered two
               little teats, round, firm and delicate, as they had been of ivory;
               whereby he at once knew that 'twas a woman, and without awaiting
               further encouragement forthwith embraced her, and would have
               kissed her, when she said: 
               Before thou art more familiar with me
               hearken to what I have to say to thee. As thou mayst perceive, I
               am no man, but a woman. Virgin I left my home, and was going
               to the Pope to obtain his sanction for my marriage, when, as Fortune
               willed, whether for thy gain or my loss, no sooner had I seen thee
               the other day, than I burned for thee with such a flame of love as
               never yet had lady for any man. Wherefore I am minded to have
               thee for my husband rather than any other; so, if thou wilt not
               have me to wife, depart at once, and return to thine own place.
               Albeit he knew not who she was, Alessandro by the retinue which
               attended her conjectured that she must be noble and wealthy, and he
               saw that she was very fair; so it was not long before he answered
               that, if such were her pleasure, it was very much to his liking.
               Whereupon she sate up, set a ring on his finger, and espoused him
               before a tiny picture of our Lord; after which they embraced, and
               to their no small mutual satisfaction solaced themselves for the rest
               of the night. At daybreak Alessandro rose, and by preconcert with
               the lady, left the chamber as he had entered it, so that none knew
               where he had passed the night: then, blithe at heart beyond measure,
               he rejoined the abbot and his train, and so, resuming their journey,
               they after many days arrived at <span class="place">Rome</span>. They had not been there
               more than a few days, when the abbot, attended by the two knights
               and Alessandro, waited on the Pope, whom, after making the due
               obeisance, he thus addressed: Holy Father, as you must know
               better than any other, whoso intends to lead a true and honourable
               life ought, as far as may be, to shun all occasion of error; for which
               cause I, having a mind to live honourably, did, the better to accomplish
               my purpose, assume the habit in which you see me, and depart
               by stealth from the court of my father, the King of <span class="place">England</span>, who
               was minded to marry me, young as you see me to be, to the aged
               King of <span class="place">Scotland</span>; and, carrying with me not a little of his treasure,
               set my face hitherward that your Holiness might bestow me in
               marriage. Nor was it the age of the King of <span class="place">Scotland</span> that moved
               me to flee so much as fear lest the frailty of my youth should, were I
               married to him, betray me to commit some breach of divine law, and
               sully the honour of my father's royal blood. And as in this frame of
               mind I journeyed, God, who knows best what is meet for every
               one, did, as I believe, of His mercy shew me him whom He is pleased
               to appoint me for my husband, even this young man (pointing to
               Alessandro) whom you see by my side, who for nobility of nature
               and bearing is a match for any great lady, though the strain of his
               blood, perhaps, be not of royal purity. Him, therefore, have I
               chosen, him will I have, and no other, no matter what my father or
               any one else may think. And albeit the main purpose with which I
               started is fulfilled, yet I have thought good to continue my journey,
               that I may visit the holy and venerable places which abound in this
               city, and your Holiness, and that so in your presence, and by consequence
               in the presence of others, I may renew my marriage-vow with
               Alessandro, whereof God alone was witness. Wherefore I humbly
               pray you that God's will and mine may be also yours, and that you
               pronounce your benison thereon, that therewith, having the more
               firm assurance of the favour of Him, whose vicar you are, we may
               both live together, and, when the time comes, die to God's glory
               and yours.
            </p>
            <p>Alessandro was filled with wonder and secret delight, when he
               heard that his wife was the daughter of the King of <span class="place">England</span>; but
               greater still was the wonder of the two knights, and such their
               wrath that, had they been anywhere else than in the Pope's presence,
               they would not have spared to affront Alessandro, and perhaps the
               lady too. The Pope, on his part, found matter enough for wonder
               as well in the lady's habit as in her choice; but, knowing that he
               could not refuse, he consented to grant her request.
            </p>
            <p>He therefore began by smoothing the ruffled tempers of the
               knights, and having reconciled them with the lady and Alessandro,
               proceeded to put matters in train for the marriage. When the day
               appointed was come, he gave a great reception, at which were
               assembled all the cardinals and many other great lords; to whom he
               presented the lady royally robed, and looking so fair and so gracious
               that she won, as she deserved, the praise of all, and likewise Alessandro,
               splendidly arrayed, and bearing himself not a whit like the young
               usurer but rather as one of royal blood, for which cause he received
               due honour from the knights. There, before the Pope himself, the
               marriage-vows were solemnly renewed; and afterwards the marriage,
               which was accompanied by every circumstance that could add grace
               and splendour to the ceremony, received the sanction of his benediction.
               Alessandro and the lady on leaving <span class="place">Rome</span> saw fit to visit
               <span class="place">Florence</span>, whither fame had already wafted the news, so that they
               were received by the citizens with every token of honour. The
               lady set the three brothers at liberty, paying all their creditors, and
               reinstated them and their wives in their several properties. So, leaving
               gracious memories behind them, Alessandro and his lady, accompanied
               by Agolante, quitted <span class="place">Florence</span>, and arriving at <span class="place">Paris</span> were
               honourably received by the King. The two knights went before
               them to <span class="place">England</span>, and by their influence induced the King to restore
               the lady to his favour, and receive her and his son-in-law with every
               circumstance of joy and honour. Alessandro he soon afterwards
               knighted with unwonted ceremony, and bestowed on him the earldom
               of Cornwall. And such was the Earl's consequence and influence
               at court that he restored peace between father and son, thereby
               conferring a great boon on the island and gaining the love and esteem
               of all the people. Agolante, whom he knighted, recovered all the
               outstanding debts in full, and returned to <span class="place">Florence</span> immensely rich.
               The Earl passed the rest of his days with his lady in great renown.
               Indeed there are those who say, that with the help of his father-in-law
               he effected by his policy and valour the conquest of <span class="place">Scotland</span>,
               and was crowned king of that country.

            <p>Scarce any part of <span class="place">Italy</span> is reputed so delectable as the sea-coast
               between <span class="place">Reggio</span> and <span class="place">Gaeta</span>; and in particular the slope which overlooks
               the sea by <span class="place">Salerno</span>, and which the dwellers there call the Slope
               of <span class="place">Amalfi</span>, is studded with little towns, gardens and fountains, and
               peopled by men as wealthy and enterprising in mercantile affairs as
               are anywhere to be found; in one of which towns, to wit, <span class="place">Ravello</span>,
               rich as its inhabitants are to-day, there was formerly a merchant,
               who surpassed them all in wealth, Landolfo Ruffolo by name, who
               yet, not content with his wealth, but desiring to double it, came
               nigh to lose it all and his own life to boot. Know, then, that this
               man, having made his calculations, as merchants are wont, bought a
               great ship, which, entirely at his own expense, he loaded with divers
               sorts of merchandise, and sailed to <span class="place">Cyprus</span>. There he found several
               other ships, each laden with just such a cargo as his own, and was
               therefore fain to dispose of his goods at a very cheap rate, insomuch
               that he might almost as well have thrown them away, and was
               brought to the verge of ruin. Mortified beyond measure to find
               himself thus reduced in a short space of time from opulence to something
               like poverty, he was at his wits' end, and rather than go home
               poor, having left home rich, he was minded to retrieve his losses by
               piracy or die in the attempt. So he sold his great ship, and with the
               price and the proceeds of the sale of his merchandise bought a light
               bark such as corsairs use, and having excellently well equipped her
               with the armament and all things else meet for such service, took to
               scouring the seas as a rover, preying upon all folk alike, but more
               particularly upon the Turk.
            </p>
            <p>In this enterprise he was more favoured by Fortune than in
               his trading adventures. A year had scarce gone by before he had
               taken so many ships from the Turk that not only had he recovered
               the fortune which he had lost in trade, but was well on the way
               to doubling it. The bitter memory of his late losses taught him
               sobriety; he estimated his gains and found them ample; and lest
               he should have a second fall, he schooled himself to rest content
               with them, and made up his mind to return home without attempting
               to add to them. Shy of adventuring once more in trade, he
               refrained from investing them in any way, but shaped his course
               for home, carrying them with him in the very same bark in which
               he had gotten them. He had already entered the Archipelago when
               one evening a contrary wind sprang up from the south-east, bringing
               with it a very heavy sea, in which his bark could not well have lived.
               He therefore steered her into a bay under the lee of one of the
               islets, and there determined to await better weather. As he lay
               there two great carracks of <span class="place">Genoa</span>, homeward-bound from <span class="place">Constantinople</span>,
               found, not without difficulty, shelter from the tempest
               in the same bay. The masters of the carracks espied the bark, and
               found out to whom she belonged: the fame of Landolfo and his
               vast wealth had already reached them, and had excited their natural
               cupidity and rapacity. They therefore determined to capture the
               bark, which lay without means of escape. Part of their men, well
               armed with cross-bows and other weapons, they accordingly sent
               ashore, so posting them that no one could leave the bark without
               being exposed to the bolts; the rest took to their boats, and rowed
               up to the side of Landolfo's little craft, which in a little time, with
               little trouble and no loss or risk, they captured with all aboard
               her. They then cleared the bark of all she contained, allowing
               Landolfo, whom they set aboard one of the carracks, only a pitiful
               doublet, and sunk her. Next day the wind shifted, and the carracks
               set sail on a westerly course, which they kept prosperously enough
               throughout the day; but towards evening a tempest arose, and the
               sea became very boisterous, so that the two ships were parted one
               from the other. And such was the fury of the gale that the ship,
               aboard which was poor, hapless Landolfo, was driven with prodigious
               force upon a shoal off the island of <span class="place">Cephalonia</span>, and broke up and
               went to pieces like so much glass dashed against a wall. Wherefore
               the unfortunate wretches that were aboard her, launched amid the
               floating merchandise and chests and planks with which the sea was
               strewn, did as men commonly do in such a case; and though the night
               was of the murkiest and the sea rose and fell in mountainous surges,
               such as could swim sought to catch hold of whatever chance brought
               in their way. Among whom hapless Landolfo, who only the day
               before had again and again prayed for death, rather than he should
               return home in such poverty, now, seeing death imminent, was
               afraid; and, like the rest, laid hold of the first plank that came to
               hand, in the hope that, if he could but avoid immediate drowning,
               God would in some way aid his escape. Gripping the beam with
               his legs as best he might, while wind and wave tossed him hither
               and thither, he contrived to keep himself afloat until broad day:
               when, looking around him, he discerned nothing but clouds and sea
               and a chest, which, borne by the wave, from time to time drew
               nigh him to his extreme terror, for he apprehended it might strike
               against the plank, and do him a mischief; and ever, as it came near
               him, he pushed it off with all the little force he had in his hand.
               But, as it happened, a sudden gust of wind swept down upon the
               sea, and struck the chest with such force that it was driven against
               the plank on which Landolfo was, and upset it, and Landolfo went
               under the waves. Swimming with an energy begotten rather of
               fear than of strength, he rose to the surface only to see the plank
               so far from him that, doubting he could not reach it, he made for
               the chest, which was close at hand; and resting his breast upon the
               lid, he did what he could to keep it straight with his arms. In this
               manner, tossed to and fro by the sea, without tasting food, for not
               a morsel had he with him, and drinking more than he cared for,
               knowing not where he was, and seeing nothing but the sea, he
               remained all that day, and the following night. The next day, as
               the will of God, or the force of the wind so ordered, more like a
               sponge than aught else, but still with both hands holding fast by
               the edges of the chest, as we see those do that clutch aught to save
               themselves from drowning, he was at length borne to the coast of
               the island of <span class="place">Corfu</span>, where by chance a poor woman was just then
               scrubbing her kitchen-ware with sand and salt-water to make it
               shine. The woman caught sight of him as he drifted shorewards,
               but making out only a shapeless mass, was at first startled, and
               shrieked and drew back. Landolfo was scarce able to see, and
               uttered no sound, for his power of speech was gone. However,
               when the sea brought him close to the shore, she distinguished the
               shape of the chest, and gazing more intently, she first made out the
               arms strained over the chest, and then discerned the face and divined
               the truth. So, prompted by pity, she went out a little way into the
               sea, which was then calm, took him by the hair of the head, and
               drew him to land, chest and all. Then, not without difficulty she
               disengaged his hands from the chest, which she set on the head of
               a little girl, her daughter, that was with her, carried him home like
               a little child, and set him in a bath, where she chafed and laved him
               with warm water, until, the vital heat and some part of the strength
               which he had lost being restored, she saw fit to take him out and
               regale him with some good wine and comfits. Thus for some days
               she tended him as best she could, until he recovered his strength, and
               knew where he was. Then, in due time, the good woman, who
               had kept his chest safe, gave it back to him, and bade him try his
               fortune.
            </p>
            <p>Landolfo could not recall the chest, but took it when she brought
               it to him, thinking that, however slight its value, it must suffice for
               a few days' charges. He found it very light, and quite lost hope;
               but when the good woman was out of doors, he opened it to see
               what was inside, and found there a great number of precious stones,
               some set, others unset. Having some knowledge of such matters,
               he saw at a glance that the stones were of great value; wherefore,
               feeling that he was still not forsaken by God, he praised His name,
               and quite recovered heart. But, having in a brief space of time
               been twice shrewdly hit by the bolts of Fortune, he was apprehensive
               of a third blow, and deemed it meet to use much circumspection in
               conveying his treasure home; so he wrapped it up in rags as best
               he could, telling the good woman that he had no more use for the
               chest, but she might keep it if she wished, and give him a sack in
               exchange. This the good woman readily did; and he, thanking
               her as heartily as he could for the service she had rendered him,
               threw his sack over his shoulders, and, taking ship, crossed to
               <span class="place">Brindisi</span>. Thence he made his way by the coast as far as <span class="place">Trani</span>,
               where he found some of his townsfolk that were drapers, to whom
               he narrated all his adventures except that of the chest. They in
               charity gave him a suit of clothes, and lent him a horse and their
               escort as far as <span class="place">Ravello</span>, whither, he said, he was minded to return.
               There, thanking God for bringing him safe home, he opened his sack,
               and examining its contents with more care than before, found the
               number and fashion of the stones to be such that the sale of them
               at a moderate price, or even less, would leave him twice as rich as
               when he left <span class="place">Ravello</span>. So, having disposed of his stones, he sent a
               large sum of money to <span class="place">Corfu</span> in recompense of the service done him
               by the good woman who had rescued him from the sea, and also to
               his friends at <span class="place">Trani</span> who had furnished him with the clothes; the
               residue he retained, and, making no more ventures in trade, lived
               and died in honourable estate.

               </p>
            </div>
            <p>In <span class="place">Perugia</span>, by what I once gathered, there lived a young man,
               Andreuccio di Pietro by name, a horse-dealer, who, having learnt
               that horses were to be had cheap at <span class="place">Naples</span>, put five hundred florins
               of gold in his purse, and in company with some other merchants
               went thither, never having been away from home before. On his
               arrival at <span class="place">Naples</span>, which was on a Sunday evening, about vespers,
               he learnt from his host that the fair would be held on the following
               morning. Thither accordingly he then repaired, and looked at
               many horses which pleased him much, and cheapening them more
               and more, and failing to strike a bargain with any one, he from
               time to time, being raw and unwary, drew out his purse of florins
               in view of all that came and went, to shew that he meant business.
            </p>
            <p>While he was thus chaffering, and after he had shewn his purse,
               there chanced to come by a Sicilian girl, fair as fair could be, but
               ready to pleasure any man for a small consideration. He did not see
               her, but she saw him and his purse, and forthwith said to herself:
               Who would be in better luck than I if all those florins were
               	mine? and so she passed on. With the girl was an old woman,
               also a Sicilian, who, when she saw Andreuccio, dropped behind the
               girl, and ran towards him, making as if she would tenderly embrace
               him. The girl observing this said nothing, but stopped and waited
               a little way off for the old woman to rejoin her. Andreuccio turned
               as the old woman came up, recognised her, and greeted her very
               cordially; but time and place not permitting much converse, she
               left him, promising to visit him at his inn; and he resumed his
               chaffering, but bought nothing that morning.
            </p>
            <p>Her old woman's intimate acquaintance with Andreuccio had no
               more escaped the girl's notice than the contents of Andreuccio's
               purse; and with the view of devising, if possible, some way to make
               the money, either in whole or in part, her own, she began cautiously
               to ask the old woman, who and whence he was, what he did there,
               and how she came to know him. The old woman gave her almost
               as much and as circumstantial information touching Andreuccio and his
               affairs as he might have done himself, for she had lived a great while with
               his father, first in <span class="place">Sicily</span>, and afterwards at <span class="place">Perugia</span>. She likewise told
               the girl the name of his inn, and the purpose with which he had
               come to <span class="place">Naples</span>. Thus fully armed with the names and all else that
               it was needful for her to know touching Andreuccio's kith and kin,
               the girl founded thereon her hopes of gratifying her cupidity, and
               forthwith devised a cunning stratagem to effect her purpose. Home
               she went, and gave the old woman work enough to occupy her all
               day, that she might not be able to visit Andreuccio; then, summoning
               to her aid a little girl whom she had well trained for such services,
               she sent her about vespers to the inn where Andreuccio lodged.
               Arrived there, the little girl asked for Andreuccio of Andreuccio
               himself, who chanced to be just outside the gate. On his answering
               that he was the man, she took him aside, and said: Sir, a lady of
               this country, so please you, would fain speak with you. 
               Whereto
               he listened with all his ears, and having a great conceit of his person,
               made up his mind that the lady was in love with him, as if there
               were ne'er another handsome fellow in <span class="place">Naples</span> but himself; so forthwith
               he replied, that he would wait on the lady, and asked where
               and when it would be her pleasure to speak with him. 
               Sir, replied
               the little girl, she expects you in her own house, if you be pleased
               to come. 
               Lead on then, I follow thee, said Andreuccio promptly,
               vouchsafing never a word to any in the inn. 
               So the little girl guided
               him to her mistress's house, which was situated in a quarter the
               character of which may be inferred from its name, Evil Hole.
               Of this, however, he neither knew nor suspected aught, but, supposing
               that the quarter was perfectly reputable and that he was going to see
               a sweet lady, strode carelessly behind the little girl into the house of
               her mistress, whom she summoned by calling out, Andreuccio is
               here; and Andreuccio then saw her advance to the head of the
               stairs to await his ascent. She was tall, still in the freshness of her
               youth, very fair of face, and very richly and nobly clad. As Andreuccio
               approached, she descended three steps to meet him with open
               arms, and clasped him round the neck, but for a while stood silent as
               if from excess of tenderness; then, bursting into a flood of tears, she
               kissed his brow, and in slightly broken accents said: O Andreuccio,
               welcome, welcome, my Andreuccio. 
               Quite lost in wonder
               to be the recipient of such caresses, Andreuccio could only answer:
               Madam, well met. 
               Whereupon she took him by the hand, led
               him up into her saloon, and thence without another word into her
               chamber, which exhaled throughout the blended fragrance of roses,
               orange-blossoms and other perfumes. He observed a handsome curtained
               bed, dresses in plenty hanging, as is customary in that country,
               on pegs, and other appointments very fair and sumptuous; which
               sights, being strange to him, confirmed his belief that he was in the
               house of no other than a great lady. They sate down side by side
               on a chest at the foot of the bed, and thus she began to speak:</p>
               
               <div class="nested">Andreuccio, I cannot doubt that thou dost marvel both at the
                  caresses which I bestow upon thee, and at my tears, seeing that thou
                  knowest me not, and, maybe, hast never so much as heard my name;
                  wait but a moment and thou shalt learn what perhaps will cause thee
                  to marvel still more, to wit, that I am thy sister; and I tell thee,
                  that, since of God's especial grace it is granted me to see one, albeit
                  I would fain see all, of my brothers before I die, I shall not meet
                  death, when the hour comes, without consolation; but thou, perchance,
                  hast never heard aught of this; wherefore listen to what I
                  shall say to thee. Pietro, my father and thine, as I suppose thou
                  mayst have heard, dwelt a long while at <span class="place">Palermo</span>, where his good
                  heart and gracious bearing caused him to be (as he still is) much
                  beloved by all that knew him; but by none was he loved so much as
                  by a gentlewoman, afterwards my mother, then a widow, who, casting
                  aside all respect for her father and brothers, ay, and her honour,
                  grew so intimate with him that a child was born, which child am I,
                  thy sister, whom thou seest before thee. Shortly after my birth it so
                  befell that Pietro must needs leave <span class="place">Palermo</span> and return to <span class="place">Perugia</span>, and
                  I, his little daughter, was left behind with my mother at <span class="place">Palermo</span>; nor,
                  so far as I have been able to learn, did he ever again bestow a thought
                  upon either of us. Wherefore--to say nothing of the love which he
                  should have borne me, his daughter by no servant or woman of low
                  degree--I should, were he not my father, gravely censure the ingratitude
                  which he shewed towards my mother, who, prompted by a most
                  loyal love, committed her fortune and herself to his keeping, without so
                  much as knowing who he was. But to what end? The wrongs of
                  long-ago are much more easily censured than redressed; enough that so
                  it was. He left me a little girl at <span class="place">Palermo</span>, where, when I was grown
                  to be almost as thou seest me, my mother, who was a rich lady, gave
                  me in marriage to an honest gentleman of the <span class="place">Girgenti</span> family, who
                  for love of my mother and myself settled in <span class="place">Palermo</span>, and there, being
                  a staunch Guelf, entered into correspondence with our King
                  Charles;Charles II. of <span class="place">Naples</span>, son of Charles of Anjou.
                  which being discovered by King FredericFrederic II. of <span class="place">Sicily</span>,
                  younger son of Peter III. of Arragon. before the time was ripe
                  for action, we had perforce to flee from <span class="place">Sicily</span> just when I was expecting
                  to become the greatest lady that ever was in the island. So,
                  taking with us such few things as we could, few, I say, in comparison
                  of the abundance which we possessed, we bade adieu to our estates
                  and palaces, and found a refuge in this country, and such favour with
                  King Charles that, in partial compensation for the losses which we
                  had sustained on his account, he has granted us estates and houses and
                  an ample pension, which he regularly pays to my husband and thy
                  brother-in-law, as thou mayst yet see. In this manner I live here;
                  but that I am blest with the sight of thee, I ascribe entirely to the
                  mercy of God; and no thanks to thee, my sweet brother.
               </div> <p>So saying
               she embraced him again, and melting anew into tears kissed his
               brow</p>.
            
            <p>This story, so congruous, so consistent in every detail, came trippingly
               and without the least hesitancy from her tongue. Andreuccio
               remembered that his father had indeed lived at <span class="place">Palermo</span>; he knew by
               his own experience the ways of young folk, how prone they are to
               love; he saw her melt into tears, he felt her embraces and sisterly
               kisses; and he took all she said for gospel. So, when she had done,
               he answered: 
               Madam, it should not surprise you that I marvel,
               seeing that, in sooth, my father, for whatever cause, said never a word
               of you and your mother, or, if he did so, it came not to my knowledge,
               so that I knew no more of you than if you had not been;
               wherefore, the lonelier I am here, and the less hope I had of such
               good luck, the better pleased I am to have found here my sister.
               And indeed, I know not any man, however exalted his station, who
               ought not to be well pleased to have such a sister; much more, then,
               I, who am but a petty merchant; but, I pray you, resolve me of one
               thing: how came you to know that I was here? 
               Then answered
               she: 'Twas told me this morning by a poor woman who is much
               about the house, because, as she tells me, she was long in the service
               of our father both at <span class="place">Palermo</span> and at <span class="place">Perugia</span>; and, but that it seemed
               more fitting that thou shouldst come to see me at home than that I
               should visit thee at an inn, I had long ago sought thee out. 
               She
               then began to inquire particularly after all his kinsfolk by name, and
               Andreuccio, becoming ever more firmly persuaded of that which it
               was least for his good to believe, answered all her questions. 
               Their
               conversation being thus prolonged and the heat great, she had Greek
               wine and sweetmeats brought in, and gave Andreuccio to drink;
               and when towards supper-time he made as if he would leave, she
               would in no wise suffer it; but, feigning to be very much vexed, she
               embraced him, saying: 
               Alas! now 'tis plain how little thou carest
               for me: to think that thou art with thy sister, whom thou seest for
               the first time, and in her own house, where thou shouldst have
               alighted on thine arrival, and thou wouldst fain depart hence to go
               sup at an inn! Nay but, for certain, thou shalt sup with me; and
               albeit, to my great regret, my husband is not here, thou shalt see that
               I can do a lady's part in shewing thee honour. 
               Andreuccio, not
               knowing what else to say, replied: Sister, I care for you with all
               a brother's affection; but if I go not, supper will await me all the
               evening at the inn, and I shall justly be taxed with discourtesy.
               Then said she: Blessed be God, there is even now in the house
               one by whom I can send word that they are not to expect thee at the
               inn, albeit thou wouldst far better discharge the debt of courtesy by
               sending word to thy friends, that they come here to sup; and then,
               if go thou must, you might all go in a body. 
               Andreuccio replied,
               that he would have none of his friends that evening, but since she
               would have him stay, he would even do her the pleasure. She then
               made a shew of sending word to the inn that they should not expect
               him at dinner. Much more talk followed; and then they sate down
               to a supper of many courses splendidly served, which she cunningly
               protracted until nightfall; nor, when they were risen from table, and
               Andreuccio was about to take his departure, would she by any means
               suffer it, saying, that <span class="place">Naples</span> was no place to walk about in after
               dark, least of all for a stranger, and that, as she had sent word to the
               inn that they were not to expect him at supper, so she had done the
               like in regard of his bed. Believing what she said, and being (in his
               false confidence) overjoyed to be with her, he stayed. After supper
               there was matter enough for talk both various and prolonged; and,
               when the night was in a measure spent, she gave up her own chamber
               to Andreuccio, leaving him with a small boy to shew him aught that
               he might have need of, while she retired with her women to another
               chamber.
            </p>
            <p>It was a very hot night; so, no sooner was Andreuccio alone than
               he stripped himself to his doublet, and drew off his stockings and laid
               them on the bed's head; and nature demanding a discharge of the
               surplus weight which he carried within him, he asked the lad
               where this might be done, and was shewn a door in a corner of
               the room, and told to go in there. Andreuccio, nothing doubting,
               did so, but, by ill luck, set his foot on a plank which was detached
               from the joist at the further end, whereby down it went, and he
               with it. By God's grace he took no hurt by the fall, though it
               was from some height, beyond sousing himself from head to foot
               in the ordure which filled the whole place, which, that you may
               the better understand what has been said, and that which is to
               follow, I will describe to you. A narrow and blind alley, such as
               we commonly see between two houses, was spanned by planks
               supported by joists on either side, and on the planks was the stool;
               of which planks that which fell with Andreuccio was one. 
               Now
               Andreuccio, finding himself down there in the alley, fell to calling on
               the lad, who, as soon as he heard him fall, had run off, and promptly
               let the lady know what had happened. She hied forthwith to her
               chamber, and after a hasty search found Andreuccio's clothes and the
               money
               in them, for he foolishly thought to secure himself against
               risk by carrying it always on his person, and thus being possessed of
               the prize for which she had played her ruse, passing herself off as the
               sister of a man of <span class="place">Perugia</span>, whereas she was really of <span class="place">Palermo</span>, she
               concerned herself no further with Andreuccio except to close with
               all speed the door by which he had gone out when he fell. 
               As the
               lad did not answer, Andreuccio began to shout more loudly; but all
               to no purpose. Whereby his suspicions were aroused, and he began
               at last to perceive the trick that had been played upon him; so he
               climbed over a low wall that divided the alley from the street, and
               hied him to the door of the house, which he knew very well. There
               for a long while he stood shouting and battering the door till it shook
               on its hinges; but all again to no purpose. 
               No doubt of his misadventure
               now lurking in his mind, he fell to bewailing himself,
               saying: Alas! in how brief a time have I lost five hundred florins
               and a sister! with much more of the like sort. Then he recommenced
               battering the door and shouting, to such a tune that not a
               few of the neighbours were roused, and finding the nuisance intolerable,
               got up; and one of the lady's servant-girls presented herself at
               the window with a very sleepy air, and said angrily: Who knocks
               below there? 
               Oh! said Andreuccio, dost not know me? I
               am Andreuccio, Madam Fiordaliso's brother. 
               Good man, she
               rejoined, if thou hast had too much to drink, go, sleep it off, and
               come back to-morrow. I know not Andreuccio, nor aught of the
               fantastic stuff thou pratest; prithee begone and be so good as to let
               us sleep in peace. 
               How? said Andreuccio, dost not understand
               what I say? For sure thou dost understand; but if Sicilian kinships
               are of such a sort that folk forget them so soon, at least return me
               my clothes, which I left within, and right glad shall I be to be off.
               Half laughing she rejoined: Good man, methinks thou dost
               dream: and so saying, she withdrew and closed the window.
               Andreuccio by this time needed no further evidence of his wrongs;
               his wrath knew no bounds, and mortification well-nigh converted
               it into frenzy; he was minded to exact by force what he had
               failed to obtain by entreaties; and so, arming himself with a
               large stone, he renewed his attack upon the door with fury, dealing
               much heavier blows than at first. Wherefore, not a few of the
               neighbours, whom he had already roused from their beds, set him
               down as an ill-conditioned rogue, and his story as a mere fiction
               intended to annoy the good woman,I. e. the bawd. and
               resenting the din which
               he now made, came to their windows, just as, when a stranger dog
               makes his appearance, all the dogs of the quarter will run to bark at
               him, and called out in chorus: 
               'Tis a gross affront to come at this
               time of night to the house of the good woman with this silly story.
               Prithee, good man, let us sleep in peace; begone in God's name; and
               if thou hast a score to settle with her, come to-morrow, but a truce
               to thy pestering to-night.
            </p>
            <p>Emboldened, perhaps, by these words, a man who lurked within
               the house, the good woman's bully, whom Andreuccio had as yet
               neither seen nor heard, shewed himself at the window, and said in a
               gruff voice and savage, menacing tone: Who is below there?
               Andreuccio looked up in the direction of the voice, and saw standing
               at the window, yawning and rubbing his eyes as if he had just been
               roused from his bed, or at any rate from deep sleep, a fellow with a
               black and matted beard, who, as far as Andreuccio's means of judging
               went, bade fair to prove a most redoubtable champion. It was not
               without fear, therefore, that he replied: I am a brother of the
               lady who is within. 
               The bully did not wait for him to finish his
               sentence, but, addressing him in a much sterner tone than before,
               called out: I know not why I come not down and give thee play
               with my cudgel, whilst thou givest me sign of life, ass, tedious driveller
               that thou must needs be, and drunken sot, thus to disturb our
               night's rest. Which said, he withdrew, and closed the window.
               Some of the neighbours who best knew the bully's quality gave
               Andreuccio fair words. For God's sake, said they, good man,
               take thyself off, stay not here to be murdered. 'Twere best for thee
               to go. 
               These counsels, which seemed to be dictated by charity,
               reinforced the fear which the voice and aspect of the bully had
               inspired in Andreuccio, who, thus despairing of recovering his money
               and in the deepest of dumps, set his face towards the quarter whence
               in the daytime he had blindly followed the little girl, and began to
               make his way back to the inn. But so noisome was the stench
               which he emitted that he resolved to turn aside and take a bath in the
               sea. So he bore leftward up a street called <span class="place">Ruga Catalana</span>, and was
               on his way towards the steep of the city, when by chance he saw two
               men coming towards him, bearing a lantern, and fearing that they
               might be patrols or other men who might do him a mischief, he stole
               away and hid himself in a dismantled house to avoid them. 
               The
               house, however, was presently entered by the two men, just as if they
               had been guided thither; and one of them having disburdened himself
               of some iron tools which he carried on his shoulder, they both
               began to examine them, passing meanwhile divers comments upon
               them. While they were thus occupied, What, said one, means
               this? Such a stench as never before did I smell the like! So
               saying, he raised the lantern a little; whereby they had a view of
               hapless Andreuccio, and asked in amazement: Who is there?
               Whereupon Andreuccio was at first silent, but when they flashed
               the light close upon him, and asked him what he did there in such
               a filthy state, he told them all that had befallen him. Casting
               about to fix the place where it occurred, they said one to another:
               Of a surety 'twas in the house of Scarabone <span class="person">Buttafuoco</span>. 
               Then
               said one, turning to Andreuccio: Good man, albeit thou hast
               lost thy money, thou hast cause enough to praise God that thou
               hadst the luck to fall; for hadst thou not fallen, be sure that, no
               sooner wert thou asleep, than thou hadst been knocked on the head,
               and lost not only thy money but thy life. But what boots it now
               to bewail thee? Thou mightest as soon pluck a star from the
               firmament as recover a single denier; nay, 'tis as much as thy life
               is worth if he do but hear that thou breathest a word of the affair.
            </p>
            <p>The two men then held a short consultation, at the close of
               which they said: Lo now; we are sorry for thee, and so we
               make thee a fair offer. If thou wilt join with us in a little matter
               which we have in hand, we doubt not but thy share of the gain
               will greatly exceed what thou hast lost. 
               Andreuccio, being now
               desperate, answered that he was ready to join them. 
               Now Messer
               <span class="person">Filippo</span> Minutolo, Archbishop of <span class="place">Naples</span>, had that day been buried
               with a ruby on his finger, worth over five hundred florins of gold,
               besides other ornaments of extreme value. The two men were
               minded to despoil the Archbishop of his fine trappings, and imparted
               their design to Andreuccio, who, cupidity getting the better of
               caution, approved it; and so they all three set forth. But as they
               were on their way to the cathedral, Andreuccio gave out so rank an
               odour that one said to the other: Can we not contrive that he
               somehow wash himself a little, that he stink not so shrewdly?
               Why yes, said the other, we are now close to a well, which
               is never without the pulley and a large bucket; 'tis but a step
               thither, and we will wash him out of hand. Arrived at the well,
               they found that the rope was still there, but the bucket had been
               removed; so they determined to attach him to the rope, and
               lower him into the well, there to wash himself, which done, he
               was to jerk the rope, and they would draw him up. Lowered
               accordingly he was; but just as, now washen, he jerked the rope, 
               it
               so happened that a company of patrols, being thirsty because 'twas a
               hot night and some rogue had led them a pretty dance, came to the
               well to drink. The two men fled, unobserved, as soon as they caught
               sight of the newcomers, who, parched with thirst, laid aside their
               bucklers, arms and surcoats, and fell to hauling on the rope, supposing
               that it bore the bucket, full of water. When, therefore, they saw
               Andreuccio, as he neared the brink of the well, loose the rope and
               clutch the brink with his hands, they were stricken with a sudden
               terror, and without uttering a word let go the rope, and took to flight
               with all the speed they could make. Whereat Andreuccio marvelled
               mightily, and had he not kept a tight grip on the brink of the well,
               he would certainly have gone back to the bottom and hardly have
               escaped grievous hurt, or death. Still greater was his astonishment,
               when, fairly landed on terra firma, he found the patrols' arms lying
               there, which he knew had not been carried by his comrades. 
               He
               felt a vague dread, he knew not why; he bewailed once more his
               evil fortune; and without venturing to touch the arms, he left the
               well and wandered he knew not whither. As he went, however, he
               fell in with his two comrades, now returning to draw him out of the
               well; who no sooner saw him than in utter amazement they
               demanded who had hauled him up. Andreuccio answered that he
               knew not, and then told them in detail how it had come about, and
               what he had found beside the well. They laughed as they apprehended
               the circumstances, and told him why they had fled, and who
               they were that had hauled him up. Then without further parley,
               for it was now midnight, they hied them to the cathedral. They had
               no difficulty in entering and finding the tomb, which was a magnificent
               structure of marble, and with their iron implements they raised
               the lid, albeit it was very heavy, to a height sufficient to allow a man
               to enter, and propped it up. This done, a dialogue ensued. Who
               shall go in? said one. 
               Not I, said the other. 
               Nor I,
               rejoined his companion; let Andreuccio go in. 
               That will not I, said Andreuccio. 
               Whereupon both turned upon him and said:
               How? thou wilt not go in? By God, if thou goest not in, we
               will give thee that over the pate with one of these iron crowbars
               that thou shalt drop down dead. 
               Terror-stricken, into the tomb
               Andreuccio went, saying to himself as he did so: These men will
               have me go in, that they may play a trick upon me: when I have
               handed everything up to them, and am sweating myself to get out
               of the tomb, they will be off about their business, and I shall be left
               with nothing for my pains. So he determined to make sure of his
               own part first; and bethinking him of the precious ring of which he
               had heard them speak, as soon as he had completed the descent, he
               drew the ring off the Archbishop's finger, and put it on his own: he
               then handed up one by one the crosier, mitre and gloves, and other of
               the Archbishop's trappings, stripping him to his shirt; which done, he
               told his comrades that there was nothing more. They insisted that
               the ring must be there, and bade him search everywhere. This he
               feigned to do, ejaculating from time to time that he found it not;
               and thus he kept them a little while in suspense. But they, who
               were in their way as cunning as he, kept on exhorting him to make
               a careful search, and, seizing their opportunity, withdrew the prop
               that supported the lid of the tomb, and took to their heels, leaving
               him there a close prisoner. You will readily conceive how Andreuccio
               behaved when he understood his situation. 
               More than once he
               applied his head and shoulders to the lid and sought with might and
               main to heave it up; but all his efforts were fruitless; so that at
               last, overwhelmed with anguish he fell in a swoon on the corpse of
               the Archbishop, and whether of the twain were the more lifeless,
               Andreuccio or the Archbishop, 'twould have puzzled an observer to
               determine.
            </p>
            <p>
               When he came to himself he burst into a torrent of tears, seeing
               now nothing in store for him but either to perish there of hunger
               and fetid odours beside the corpse and among the worms, or, should
               the tomb be earlier opened, to be taken and hanged as a thief. 
               These
               most lugubrious meditations were interrupted by a sound of persons
               walking and talking in the church. They were evidently a numerous
               company, and their purpose, as Andreuccio surmised, was the very
               same with which he and his comrades had come thither: whereby
               his terror was mightily increased. Presently the folk opened the
               tomb, and propped up the lid, and then fell to disputing as to who
               should go in. None was willing, and the contention was protracted;
               but at length one--'twas a priest--said: Of what are ye afeared?
               	Think ye to be eaten by him? Nay, the dead eat not the living. I
               	will go in myself. 
               So saying he propped his breast upon the edge
               of the lid, threw his head back, and thrust his legs within, that he
               might go down feet foremost. On sight whereof Andreuccio started
               to his feet, and seizing hold of one of the priest's legs, made as if he
               would drag him down; which caused the priest to utter a prodigious
               yell, and bundle himself out of the tomb with no small celerity.
               The rest took to flight in a panic, as if a hundred thousand devils
               were at their heels. The tomb being thus left open, Andreuccio, the
               ring still on his finger, sprang out. The way by which he had
               entered the church served him for egress, and roaming at random, he
               arrived towards daybreak at the coast. Diverging thence he came
               by chance upon his inn, where he found that his host and his
               comrades had been anxious about him all night. When he told
               them all that had befallen him, they joined with the host in advising
               him to leave <span class="place">Naples</span> at once. He accordingly did so, and returned
               to <span class="place">Perugia</span>, having invested in a ring the money with which he had
               intended to buy horses.

            <p>Dearest ladies, you must know that after the death of the
               Emperor Frederic II. the crown of <span class="place">Sicily</span> passed to Manfred; whose
               favour was enjoyed in the highest degree by a gentleman of <span class="place">Naples</span>,
               Arrighetto Capece by name, who had to wife Madonna Beritola
               Caracciola, a fair and gracious lady, likewise a Neapolitan. Now
               when Manfred was conquered and slain by King Charles I. at
               <span class="place">Benevento</span>, and the whole realm transferred its allegiance to the
               conqueror, Arrighetto, who was then governor of <span class="place">Sicily</span>, no sooner
               received the tidings than he prepared for instant flight, knowing that
               little reliance was to be placed on the fleeting faith of the Sicilians,
               and not being minded to become a subject of his master's enemy.
               But the Sicilians having intelligence of his plans, he and many other
               friends and servants of King Manfred were surprised, taken prisoners
               and delivered over to King Charles, to whom the whole island was
               soon afterwards surrendered. In this signal reversal of the wonted
               course of things Madam Beritola, knowing not what was become
               of Arrighetto, and from the past ever auguring future evil, lest she
               should suffer foul dishonour, abandoned all that she possessed, and with
               a son of, perhaps, eight years, Giusfredi by name, being also pregnant,
               fled in a boat to <span class="place">Lipari</span>, where she gave birth to another male child,
               whom she named Outcast. Then with her sons and a hired nurse
               she took ship for <span class="place">Naples</span>, intending there to rejoin her family.
               Events, however, fell out otherwise than she expected; for by stress
               of weather the ship was carried out of her course to the desert
               island of <span class="place">Ponza</span>,The largest, now inhabited, of a group of islets in
               	the
               	Gulf of <span class="place">Gaeta</span>. where they put in to a little bay until such time
               as they might safely continue their voyage. Madam Beritola
               landed with the rest on the island, and, leaving them all, sought out
               a lonely and secluded spot, and there abandoned herself to melancholy
               brooding on the loss of her dear Arrighetto. While thus she spent
               her days in solitary preoccupation with her grief it chanced that a
               galley of corsairs swooped down upon the island, and, before either
               the mariners or any other folk were aware of their peril, made
               an easy capture of them all and sailed away; so that, when Madam
               Beritola, her wailing for that day ended, returned, as was her wont,
               to the shore to solace herself with the sight of her sons, she found
               none there. At first she was lost in wonder, then with a sudden
               suspicion of the truth she bent her eyes seaward, and there saw the
               galley still at no great distance, towing the ship in her wake. Thus
               apprehending beyond all manner of doubt that she had lost her sons
               as well as her husband, and that, alone, desolate and destitute, she
               might not hope that any of her lost ones would ever be restored to
               her, she fell down on the shore in a swoon with the names of her
               husband and sons upon her lips. None was there to administer cold
               water or aught else that might recall her truant powers; her animal
               spirits might even wander whithersoever they would at their sweet
               will: strength, however, did at last return to her poor exhausted
               frame, and therewith tears and lamentations, as, plaintively repeating
               her sons' names, she roamed in quest of them from cavern to cavern.
               Long time she sought them thus; but when she saw that her labour
               was in vain, and that night was closing in, hope, she knew not why,
               began to return, and with it some degree of anxiety on her own
               account. Wherefore she left the shore and returned to the cavern
               where she had been wont to indulge her plaintive mood. She
               passed the night in no small fear and indescribable anguish; the new
               day came, and, as she had not supped, she was fain after tierce to
               appease her hunger, as best she could, by a breakfast of herbs: this
               done, she wept and began to ruminate on her future way of life.
               While thus engaged, she observed a she-goat come by and go into
               an adjacent cavern, and after a while come forth again and go into
               the wood: thus roused from her reverie she got up, went into the
               cavern from which the she-goat had issued, and there saw two kids,
               which might have been born that very day, and seemed to her the
               sweetest and the most delicious things in the world: and, having,
               by reason of her recent delivery, milk still within her, she took them
               up tenderly, and set them to her breast. They, nothing loath,
               sucked at her teats as if she had been their own dam; and thenceforth
               made no distinction between her and the dam. Which caused
               the lady to feel that she had found company in the desert; and so,
               living on herbs and water, weeping as often as she bethought her
               of her husband and sons and her past life, she disposed herself to
               live and die there, and became no less familiar with the she-goat
               than with her young.
            </p>
            <p>The gentle lady thus leading the life of a wild creature, it
               chanced that after some months stress of weather brought a Pisan
               ship to the very same bay in which she had landed. The ship lay
               there for several days, having on board a gentleman, <span class="person">Currado</span> de'
               Malespini by name (of the same family as the Marquis), who with
               his noble and most devout lady was returning home from a pilgrimage,
               having visited all the holy places in the realm of <span class="place">Apulia</span>. 
               To
               beguile the tedium of the sojourn <span class="person">Currado</span> with his lady, some
               servants and his dogs, set forth one day upon a tour through the
               island. As they neared the place where Madam Beritola dwelt,
               <span class="person">Currado</span>'s dogs on view of the two kids, which, now of a fair size,
               were grazing, gave chase. The kids, pursued by the dogs, made
               straight for Madam Beritola's cavern. She, seeing what was toward,
               started to her feet, caught up a stick, and drove the dogs back.
               <span class="person">Currado</span> and his lady coming up after the dogs, gazed on Madam
               Beritola, now tanned and lean and hairy, with wonder, which she
               more than reciprocated. At her request <span class="person">Currado</span> called off the
               dogs; and then he and his lady besought her again and again to
               say who she was and what she did there. So she told them all
               about herself, her rank, her misfortunes, and the savage life which
               she was minded to lead. <span class="person">Currado</span>, who had known Arrighetto
               Capece very well, was moved to tears by compassion, and exhausted
               all his eloquence to induce her to change her mind, offering to escort
               her home, or to take her to live with him in honourable estate as his
               sister until God should vouchsafe her kindlier fortune. The lady
               declining all his offers, <span class="person">Currado</span> left her with his wife, whom he bade
               see that food was brought thither, and let Madam Beritola, who was
               all in rags, have one of her own dresses to wear, and do all that she
               could to persuade her to go with them. So the gentle lady stayed
               with Madam Beritola, and after condoling with her at large on her
               misfortunes had food and clothing brought to her, and with the
               greatest difficulty in the world prevailed upon her to eat and dress
               herself. At last, after much beseeching, she induced her to depart
               from her oft-declared intention never to go where she might meet
               any that knew her, and accompany them to <span class="place">Lunigiana</span>, taking with
               her the two kids and the dam, which latter had in the meantime
               returned, and to the gentle lady's great surprise had greeted
               Madam Beritola with the utmost affection. So with the return
               of fair weather Madam Beritola, taking with her the dam and the
               two kids, embarked with <span class="person">Currado</span> and his lady on their ship, being
               called by them--for her true name was not to be known of
               all--Cavriuola;I. e. she-goat. and the wind holding
               fair, they speedily reached the
               mouth of the <span class="place">Magra</span>,Between Liguria and <span class="place">Tuscany</span>. and landing
               hied
               them to <span class="person">Currado</span>'s castle;
               
               
               where Madam Beritola abode with <span class="person">Currado</span>'s lady in the quality of
               her maid, serving her well and faithfully, wearing widow's weeds,
               and feeding and tending her kids with assiduous and loving care.
            </p>
            <p>The corsairs, who, not espying Madam Beritola, had left her at
               <span class="place">Ponza</span> when they took the ship on which she had come thither,
               had made a course to <span class="place">Genoa</span>, taking with them all the other folk.
               On their arrival the owners of the galley shared the booty, and so
               it happened that as part thereof Madam Beritola's nurse and her two
               boys fell to the lot of one Messer Guasparrino d'Oria, who sent all
               three to his house, being minded to keep them there as domestic
               slaves. The nurse, beside herself with grief at the loss of her
               mistress and the woful plight in which she found herself and her
               two charges, shed many a bitter tear. But, seeing that they were
               unavailing, and that she and the boys were slaves together, she,
               having, for all her low estate, her share of wit and good sense, made
               it her first care to comfort them; then, regardful of the condition
               to which they were reduced, she bethought her, that, if the lads were
               recognised, 'twould very likely be injurious to them. So, still hoping
               that some time or another Fortune would change her mood, and
               they be able, if living, to regain their lost estate, she resolved to let
               none know who they were, until she saw a fitting occasion; and
               accordingly, whenever she was questioned thereof by any, she gave
               them out as her own children. The name of the elder she changed
               from Giusfredi to Giannotto di <span class="place">Procida</span>; the name of the younger
               she did not think it worth while to change. She spared no pains
               to make Giusfredi understand the reason why she had changed his
               name, and the risk which he might run if he were recognised.
               This she impressed upon him not once only but many times; and
               the boy, who was apt to learn, followed the instructions of the wise
               nurse with perfect exactitude.
            </p>
            <p>So the two boys, ill clad and worse shod, continued with the
               nurse in Messer Guasparrino's house for two years, patiently performing
               all kinds of menial offices. But Giannotto, being now
               sixteen years old, and of a spirit that consorted ill with servitude,
               brooked not the baseness of his lot, and dismissed himself from
               Messer Guasparrino's service by getting aboard a galley bound
               for <span class="place">Alexandria</span>, and travelled far and wide, and fared never the
               better. In the course of his wanderings he learned that his father,
               whom he had supposed to be dead, was still living, but kept in prison
               under watch and ward by King Charles. He was grown a tall
               handsome young man, when, perhaps three or four years after he
               had given Messer Guasparrino the slip, weary of roaming and all
               but despairing of his fortune, he came to <span class="place">Lunigiana</span>, and by chance
               took service with <span class="person">Currado</span> Malespini, who found him handy, and
               was well-pleased with him. His mother, who was in attendance
               on <span class="person">Currado</span>'s lady, he seldom saw, and never recognised her, nor
               she him; so much had time changed both from their former aspect
               since they last met. While Giannotto was thus in the service of
               <span class="person">Currado</span>, it fell out by the death of Niccolò da Grignano that his
               widow, Spina, <span class="person">Currado</span>'s daughter, returned to her father's house.
               Very fair she was and loveable, her age not more than sixteen years,
               and so it was that she saw Giannotto with favour, and he her, and
               both fell ardently in love with one another. Their passion was
               early gratified; but several months elapsed before any detected its
               existence. Wherefore, growing overbold, they began to dispense with
               the precautions which such an affair demanded. So one day, as
               they walked with others through a wood, where the trees grew fair
               and close, the girl and Giannotto left the rest of the company some
               distance behind, and, thinking that they were well in advance, found
               a fair pleasaunce girt in with trees and carpeted with abundance of
               grass and flowers, and fell to solacing themselves after the manner
               of lovers. Long time they thus dallied, though such was their
               delight that all too brief it seemed to them, and so it befell that they
               were surprised first by the girl's mother and then by <span class="person">Currado</span>.
               Pained beyond measure by what he had seen, <span class="person">Currado</span>, without
               assigning any cause, had them both arrested by three of his servants
               and taken in chains to one of his castles; where in a frenzy of
               passionate wrath he left them, resolved to put them to an ignominious
               death. The girl's mother was also very angry, and deemed her
               daughter's fall deserving of the most rigorous chastisement, but,
               when by one of <span class="person">Currado</span>'s chance words she divined the doom which
               he destined for the guilty pair, she could not reconcile herself to
               it, and hasted to intercede with her angry husband, beseeching him
               to refrain the impetuous wrath which would hurry him in his
               old age to murder his daughter and imbrue his hands in the
               blood of his servant, and vent it in some other way, as by close
               confinement and duress, whereby the culprits should be brought to
               repent them of their fault in tears. Thus, and with much more
               to the like effect, the devout lady urged her suit, and at length
               prevailed upon her husband to abandon his murderous design.
               Wherefore, he commanded that the pair should be confined in
               separate prisons, and closely guarded, and kept short of food and
               in sore discomfort, until further order; which was accordingly done;
               and the life which the captives led, their endless tears, their fasts of
               inordinate duration, may be readily imagined.
            </p>
            <p>Giannotto and Spina had languished in this sorry plight for full
               a year, entirely ignored by <span class="person">Currado</span>, when in concert with Messer
               Gian di <span class="place">Procida</span>, King Peter of Arragon raised a rebellionThe Sicilian
               Vespers, Easter, 1282. in the island
               of <span class="place">Sicily</span>, and wrested it from King Charles, whereat <span class="person">Currado</span>, being a
               Ghibelline, was overjoyed. Hearing the tidings from one of his warders,
               Giannotto heaved a great sigh, and said: Alas, fourteen years have I
               been a wanderer upon the face of the earth, looking for no other than
               this very event; and now, that my hopes of happiness may be for ever
               frustrate, it has come to pass only to find me in prison, whence I
               may never think to issue alive. 
               How? said the warder; what
               signify to thee these doings of these mighty monarchs? What part
               hadst thou in <span class="place">Sicily</span>? 
               Giannotto answered: 'Tis as if my heart
               were breaking when I bethink me of my father and what part he had
               in <span class="place">Sicily</span>. I was but a little lad when I fled the island, but yet I
               remember him as its governor in the time of King Manfred.
               And who then was thy father? demanded the warder. 
               His
               name, rejoined Giannotto, I need no longer scruple to disclose,
               seeing that I find myself in the very strait which I hoped to avoid by
               concealing it. He was and still is, if he live, Arrighetto Capece;
               and my name is not Giannotto but Giusfredi; and I doubt not but,
               were I once free, and back in <span class="place">Sicily</span>, I might yet hold a very honourable
               position in the island.
            </p>
            <p>The worthy man asked no more questions, but, as soon as he found
               opportunity, told what he had learned to <span class="person">Currado</span>; who, albeit he
               made light of it in the warder's presence, repaired to Madam Beritola,
               and asked her in a pleasant manner, whether she had had by Arrighetto
               a son named Giusfredi. The lady answered, in tears, that, if
               the elder of her two sons were living, such would be his name, and
               his age twenty-two years. This inclined <span class="person">Currado</span> to think that
               Giannotto and Giusfredi were indeed one and the same; and it
               occurred to him, that, if so it were, he might at once shew himself
               most merciful and blot out his daughter's shame and his own by
               giving her to him in marriage; wherefore he sent for Giannotto
               privily, and questioned him in detail touching his past life. And
               finding by indubitable evidence that he was indeed Giusfredi, son of
               Arrighetto Capece, he said to him: 
               Giannotto, thou knowest the
               wrong which thou hast done me in the person of my daughter, what
               and how great it is, seeing that I used thee well and kindly, and thou
               shouldst therefore, like a good servant, have shewn thyself jealous
               of my honour, and zealous in my interest; and many there are who,
               hadst thou treated them as thou hast treated me, would have caused
               thee to die an ignominious death; which my clemency would not
               brook. But now, as it is even so as thou sayst, and thou art of
               gentle blood by both thy parents, I am minded to put an end to thy
               sufferings as soon as thou wilt, releasing thee from the captivity in
               which thou languishest, and setting thee in a happy place, and reinstating
               at once thy honour and my own. Thy intimacy with Spina--albeit
               shameful to both--was yet prompted by love. Spina, as
               thou knowest, is a widow, and her dower is ample and secure. What
               her breeding is, and her father's and her mother's, thou knowest:
               of thy present condition I say nought. Wherefore, when thou wilt,
               I am consenting, that, having been with dishonour thy friend, she
               become with honour thy wife, and that, so long as it seem good to
               thee, thou tarry here with her and me as my son.
            </p>
            <p>Captivity had wasted Giannotto's flesh, but had in no degree
               impaired the generosity of spirit which he derived from his ancestry,
               or the whole-hearted love which he bore his lady. So, albeit he
               ardently desired that which <span class="person">Currado</span> offered, and knew that he was
               in <span class="person">Currado</span>'s power, yet, even as his magnanimity prompted, so,
               unswervingly, he made answer: <span class="person">Currado</span>, neither ambition nor
               cupidity nor aught else did ever beguile me to any treacherous
               machination against either thy person or thy property. Thy daughter
               I loved, and love and shall ever love, because I deem her worthy of
               my love; and, if I dealt with her after a fashion which to the
               mechanic mind seems hardly honourable, I did but commit that fault
               which is ever congenial to youth, which can never be eradicated so
               long as youth continues, and which, if the aged would but remember
               that they were once young and would measure the delinquencies
               of others by their own and their own by those of others, would not
               be deemed so grave as thou and many others depict it; and what
               I did, I did as a friend, not as an enemy. That which thou offerest
               I have ever desired, and should long ago have sought, had I supposed
               that thou wouldst grant it, and 'twill be the more grateful to me in
               proportion to the depth of my despair. But if thy intent be not such
               as thy words import, feed me not with vain hopes, but send me back
               to prison there to suffer whatever thou mayst be pleased to inflict; nor
               doubt that even as I love Spina, so for love of her shall I ever love
               thee, though thou do thy worst, and still hold thee in reverent
               regard.
            </p>
            <p><span class="person">Currado</span> marvelled to hear him thus speak, and being assured of
               his magnanimity and the fervour of his love, held him the more dear;
               wherefore he rose, embraced and kissed him, and without further
               delay bade privily bring thither Spina, who left her prison wasted and
               wan and weak, and so changed that she seemed almost another
               woman than of yore, even as Giannotto was scarce his former self.
               Then and there in <span class="person">Currado</span>'s presence they plighted their troth
               according to our custom of espousals; and some days afterwards
               <span class="person">Currado</span>, having in the meantime provided all things meet for their
               convenience and solace, yet so as that none should surmise what had
               happened, deemed it now time to gladden their mothers with the
               news. So he sent for his lady and Cavriuola, and thus, addressing first
               Cavriuola, he spoke: What would you say, madam, were I to
               restore you your elder son as the husband of one of my daughters?
               Cavriuola answered: I should say, that, were it possible for you
               to strengthen the bond which attaches me to you, then assuredly you
               had so done, in that you restored to me that which I cherish more
               tenderly than myself, and in such a guise as in some measure to renew
               within me the hope which I had lost: more I could not say. And
               so, weeping, she was silent. Then, turning to his lady, <span class="person">Currado</span> said:
               And thou, madam, what wouldst thou think if I were to present
               thee with such a son-in-law? 
               A son-in-law, she answered,
               that was not of gentle blood, but a mere churl, so he pleased you,
               would well content me. 
               So! returned <span class="person">Currado</span>; I hope within
               a few days to gladden the hearts of both of you.
            </p>
            <p>He waited only until the two young folk had recovered their
               wonted mien, and were clad in a manner befitting their rank. Then,
               addressing Giusfredi, he said: Would it not add to thy joy to see
               thy mother here? 
               I dare not hope, returned Giusfredi, that she
               has survived calamities and sufferings such as hers; but were it so,
               great indeed would be my joy, and none the less that by her counsel
               I might be aided to the recovery (in great measure) of my lost heritage
               in <span class="place">Sicily</span>. 
               Whereupon <span class="person">Currado</span> caused both the ladies to come
               thither, and presented to them the bride. The gladness with which
               they both greeted her was a wonder to behold, and no less great was
               their wonder at the benign inspiration that had prompted <span class="person">Currado</span> to
               unite her in wedlock with Giannotto, whom <span class="person">Currado</span>'s words caused
               Madam Beritola to survey with some attention. A hidden spring of
               memory was thus touched; she recognised in the man the lineaments
               of her boy, and awaiting no further evidence she ran with open arms
               and threw herself upon his neck. No word did she utter, for very
               excess of maternal tenderness and joy; but, every avenue of sense
               closed, she fell as if bereft of life within her son's embrace. 
               Giannotto,
               who had often seen her in the castle and never recognised her,
               marvelled not a little, but nevertheless it at once flashed upon him
               that 'twas his mother, and blaming himself for his past inadvertence
               he took her in his arms and wept and tenderly kissed her. 
               With gentle
               solicitude <span class="person">Currado</span>'s lady and Spina came to her aid, and restored her
               suspended animation with cold water and other remedies. She then
               with many tender and endearing words kissed him a thousand times
               or more, which tokens of her love he received with a look of reverential
               acknowledgment. Thrice, nay a fourth time were these glad
               and gracious greetings exchanged, and joyful indeed were they that
               witnessed them, and hearkened while mother and son compared their
               past adventures. Then <span class="person">Currado</span>, who had already announced his new
               alliance to his friends, and received their felicitations, proceeded to
               give order for the celebration of the event with all becoming gaiety
               and splendour. As he did so, Giusfredi said to him: 
               <span class="person">Currado</span>, you
               have long given my mother honourable entertainment, and on me
               you have conferred many boons; wherefore, that you may fill up the
               measure of your kindness, 'tis now my prayer that you be pleased to
               gladden my mother and my marriage feast and me with the presence
               of my brother, now in servitude in the house of Messer Guasparrino
               d'Oria, who, as I have already told you, made prize of both him and
               me; and that then you send some one to <span class="place">Sicily</span>, who shall make himself
               thoroughly acquainted with the circumstances and condition of
               the country, and find out how it has fared with my father Arrighetto,
               whether he be alive or dead, and if alive, in what circumstances, and
               being thus fully informed, return to us with the tidings. 
               <span class="person">Currado</span>
               assented, and forthwith sent most trusty agents both to <span class="place">Genoa</span> and to
               <span class="place">Sicily</span>. So in due time an envoy arrived at <span class="place">Genoa</span>, and made instant
               suit to Guasparrino on <span class="person">Currado</span>'s part for the surrender of Outcast and
               the nurse, setting forth in detail all that had passed between <span class="person">Currado</span>
               and Giusfredi and his mother. Whereat Messer Guasparrino was
               mightily astonished, and said: Of a surety there is nought that, being
               able, I would not do to pleasure <span class="person">Currado</span>; and true it is that I have
               had in my house for these fourteen years the boy whom thou dost now
               demand of me, and his mother, and gladly will I surrender them; but
               tell <span class="person">Currado</span> from me to beware of excessive credulity, and to put no
               faith in the idle tales of Giannotto, or Giusfredi, as thou sayst he
               calls himself, who is by no means so guileless as he supposes.
            </p>
            <p>Then, having provided for the honourable entertainment of the
               worthy envoy, he sent privily for the nurse, and cautiously sounded
               her as to the affair. The nurse had heard of the revolt of <span class="place">Sicily</span>, and
               had learned that Arrighetto was still alive. She therefore banished
               fear, and told Messer Guasparrino the whole story, and explained to
               him the reasons why she had acted as she had done. 
               Finding that
               what she said accorded very well with what he had learned from
               <span class="person">Currado</span>'s envoy, he inclined to credit the story, and most astutely
               probing the matter in divers ways, and always finding fresh grounds
               for confidence, he reproached himself for the sorry manner in which
               he had treated the boy, and by way of amends gave him one of his
               own daughters, a beautiful girl of eleven years, to wife with a dowry
               suited to Arrighetto's rank, and celebrated their nuptials with great
               festivity. He then brought the boy and girl, <span class="person">Currado</span>'s envoy, and the
               nurse in a well-armed galliot to <span class="place">Lerici</span>, being there met by <span class="person">Currado</span>,
               who had a castle not far off, where great preparations had been made
               for their entertainment: and thither accordingly he went with his
               whole company. 
               What cheer the mother had of her son, the brothers
               of one another, and all the three of the faithful nurse; what cheer
               Messer Guasparrino and his daughter had of all, and all of them, and
               what cheer all had of <span class="person">Currado</span> and his lady and their sons and their
               friends, words may not describe; wherefore, my ladies, I leave it to
               your imagination. And that their joy might be full, God, who, when
               He gives, gives most abundantly, added the glad tidings that Arrighetto
               Capece was alive and prosperous. For, when in the best of spirits the
               ladies and gentlemen had sat them down to feast, and they were yet
               at the first course, the envoy from <span class="place">Sicily</span> arrived, and among other
               matters reported, that, no sooner had the insurrection broken out in the
               island than the people hied them in hot haste to the prison where
               Arrighetto was kept in confinement by King Charles, and despatching
               the guards, brought him forth, and knowing him to be a capital
               enemy to King Charles made him their captain, and under his command
               fell upon and massacred the French. Whereby he had won
               the highest place in the favour of King Peter, who had granted him
               restitution of all his estates and honours, so that he was now both
               prosperous and mighty. The envoy added that Arrighetto had
               received him with every token of honour, had manifested the utmost
               delight on hearing of his lady and son, of whom no tidings had reached
               him since his arrest, and had sent, to bring them home, a brigantine
               with some gentlemen aboard, whose arrival might hourly be expected.
            </p>
            <p>The envoy, and the good news which he brought, were heartily
               welcome; and presently <span class="person">Currado</span>, with some of his friends, encountered
               the gentlemen who came for Madam Beritola and Giusfredi, and
               saluting them cordially invited them to his feast, which was not yet
               half done. Joy unheard-of was depicted on the faces of the lady, of
               Giusfredi, and of all the rest as they greeted them; nor did they on
               their part take their places at the table before, as best they might,
               they had conveyed to <span class="person">Currado</span> and his lady Arrighetto's greetings and
               grateful acknowledgments of the honour which they had conferred
               upon his lady and his son, and had placed Arrighetto, to the uttermost
               of his power, entirely at their service. Then, turning to Messer
               Guasparrino, of whose kindness Arrighetto surmised nothing, they
               said that they were very sure that, when he learned the boon which
               Outcast had received at his hands, he would pay him the like and an
               even greater tribute of gratitude. This speech ended, they feasted
               most joyously with the brides and bridegrooms. So passed the day,
               the first of many which <span class="person">Currado</span> devoted to honouring his son-in-law
               and his other intimates, both kinsfolk and friends. The time of
               festivity ended, Madam Beritola and Giusfredi and the rest felt that
               they must leave: so, taking Spina with them, they parted, not
               without many tears, from <span class="person">Currado</span> and his lady and Guasparrino, and
               went aboard the brigantine, which, wafted by a prosperous wind,
               soon brought them to <span class="place">Sicily</span>. At <span class="place">Palermo</span> they were met by
               Arrighetto, who received them all, ladies and sons alike, with such
               cheer as it were vain to attempt to describe. There it is believed
               that they all lived long and happily and in amity with God, being
               not unmindful of the blessings which He had conferred upon them.

                  would perhaps have been moved to tears, so great was the sympathy
                  which they felt for Madam Beritola in her various fortunes. But

               <p>Hardly, gracious ladies, is it given to us to know that which makes
                  for our good; insomuch that, as has been observable in a multitude
                  of instances, many, deeming that the acquisition of great riches would
                  ensure them an easy and tranquil existence, have not only besought
                  them of God in prayer, but have sought them with such ardour that
                  they have spared no pains and shrunk from no danger in the quest,
                  and have attained their end only to lose, at the hands of some one
                  covetous of their vast inheritance, a life with which before the days
                  of their prosperity they were well content. Others, whose course,
                  perilous with a thousand battles, stained with the blood of their
                  brothers and their friends, has raised them from base to regal estate,
                  have found in place of the felicity they expected an infinity of cares
                  and fears, and have proved by experience that a chalice may be
                  poisoned, though it be of gold, and set on the table of a king. 
                  Many
                  have most ardently desired beauty and strength and other advantages
                  of person, and have only been taught their error by the death or
                  dolorous life which these very advantages entailed upon them.
                  And so, not to instance each particular human desire, I say, in sum,
                  that there is none of them that men may indulge in full confidence
                  as exempt from the chances and changes of fortune; wherefore, if we
                  would act rightly, we ought to school ourselves to take and be
                  content with that which He gives us, who alone knows and can
                  afford us that of which we have need. But, divers as are the
                  aberrations of desire to which men are prone, so, gracious ladies,
                  there is one to which you are especially liable, in that you are unduly
                  solicitous of beauty, insomuch, that, not content with the charms
                  which nature has allotted you, you endeavour to enhance them with
                  wondrous ingenuity of art; wherefore I am minded to make you
                  acquainted with the coil of misadventures in which her beauty
                  involved a fair Saracen, who in the course of, perhaps, four years was
                  wedded nine several times.

            <p>There was of yore a Soldan of <span class="place">Babylon</span>,I. e. according to
               medieval usage, <span class="place">Egypt</span>. by name of Beminedab,
               who in his day had cause enough to be well content with his luck.
               Many children male and female had he, and among them a daughter,
               <span class="person">Alatiel</span> by name, who by common consent of all that saw her was
               the most beautiful woman then to be found in the world. Now the
               Soldan, having been signally aided by the King of AlgarveI. e.
               <span class="place">Garbo</span>, the coast of <span class="place">Africa</span> opposite <span class="place">Andalusia</span> and <span class="place">Granada</span>. in
               inflicting a great defeat upon a host of Arabs that had attacked him,
               had at his instance and by way of special favour given <span class="person">Alatiel</span> to the
               King to wife; wherefore, with an honourable escort of gentlemen
               and ladies most nobly and richly equipped, he placed her aboard a
               well-armed, well-furnished ship, and, commending her to God, sped
               her on her journey. The mariners, as soon as the weather was
               favourable, hoisted sail, and for some days after their departure from
               <span class="place">Alexandria</span> had a prosperous voyage; but when they had passed
               <span class="place">Sardinia</span>, and were beginning to think that they were nearing their
               journey's end, they were caught one day between divers cross winds,
               each blowing with extreme fury, whereby the ship laboured so sorely
               that not only the lady but the seamen from time to time gave themselves
               up for lost. But still, most manfully and skilfully they
               struggled might and main with the tempest, which, ever waxing
               rather than waning, buffeted them for two days with immense unintermittent
               surges; and being not far from the island of <span class="place">Majorca</span>, as
               the third night began to close in, wrapt in clouds and mist and thick
               darkness, so that they saw neither the sky nor aught else, nor by any
               nautical skill might conjecture where they were, they felt the ship's
               timbers part. Wherefore, seeing no way to save the ship, each thought
               only how best to save himself, and, a boat being thrown out, the
               masters first, and then the men, one by one, though the first-comers
               sought with knives in their hands to bar the passage of the rest, all,
               rather than remain in the leaky ship, crowded into it, and there
               found the death which they hoped to escape. For the boat, being in
               such stress of weather and with such a burden quite unmanageable,
               went under, and all aboard her perished; whereas the ship, leaky
               though she was, and all but full of water, yet, driven by the fury of
               the tempest, was hurled with prodigious velocity upon the shore of
               the island of <span class="place">Majorca</span>, and struck it with such force as to embed
               herself in the sand, perhaps a stone's throw from terra firma, where
               she remained all night beaten and washed by the sea, but no more
               to be moved by the utmost violence of the gale. None had remained
               aboard her but the lady and her women, whom the malice of
               the elements and their fears had brought to the verge of death.
               When it was broad day and the storm was somewhat abated, the
               lady, half dead, raised her head, and in faltering accents began to call
               first one and then another of her servants. She called in vain, however;
               for those whom she called were too far off to hear. Great
               indeed was her wonder and fear to find herself thus without sight of
               human face or sound of other voice than her own; but, struggling
               to her feet as best she might, she looked about her, and saw the ladies
               that were of her escort, and the other women, all prostrate on the
               deck; so, after calling them one by one, she began at length to touch
               them, and finding few that shewed sign of life, for indeed, between
               grievous sea-sickness and fear, they had little life left, she grew more
               terrified than before. However, being in sore need of counsel, all
               alone as she was, and without knowledge or means of learning where
               she was, she at last induced such as had life in them to get upon their
               feet, with whom, as none knew where the men were gone, and the
               ship was now full of water and visibly breaking up, she abandoned
               herself to piteous lamentations.
            </p>
            <p>It was already none before they descried any one on the shore or
               elsewhere to whom they could make appeal for help; but shortly
               after none it so chanced that a gentleman, Pericone da Visalgo by
               name, being on his return from one of his estates, passed that way
               with some mounted servants. Catching sight of the ship, he apprehended
               the circumstances at a glance, and bade one of his servants
               try to get aboard her, and let him know the result. The servant
               with some difficulty succeeded in boarding the vessel, and found the
               gentle lady with her few companions ensconced under shelter of the
               prow, and shrinking timidly from observation. At the first sight of
               him they wept, and again and again implored him to have pity on
               them; but finding that he did not understand them, nor they him,
               they sought by gestures to make him apprehend their forlorn
               condition.
            </p>
            <p>With these tidings the servant, after making such survey of the
               ship as he could, returned to Pericone, who forthwith caused the
               ladies, and all articles of value which were in the ship and could be
               removed, to be brought off her, and took them with him to one of
               his castles. The ladies' powers were soon in a measure restored by
               food and rest, and by the honour which was paid to <span class="person">Alatiel</span>, and
               <span class="person">Alatiel</span> alone by all the rest, as well as by the richness of her dress,
               Pericone perceived that she must be some great lady. Nor, though
               she was still pale, and her person bore evident marks of the sea's
               rough usage, did he fail to note that it was cast in a mould of
               extraordinary
               beauty. Wherefore his mind was soon made up that, if she
               lacked a husband, he would take her to wife, and that, if he could
               not have her to wife, then he would make her his mistress. So
               this ardent lover, who was a man of powerful frame and haughty
               mien, devoted himself for several days to the service of the
               lady with excellent effect, for the lady completely recovered her
               strength and spirits, so that her beauty far exceeded Pericone's most
               sanguine conjectures. Great therefore beyond measure was his
               sorrow that he understood not her speech, nor she his, so that neither
               could know who the other was; but being inordinately enamoured of
               her beauty, he sought by such mute blandishments as he could devise
               to declare his love, and bring her of her own accord to gratify his
               desire. All in vain, however; she repulsed his advances point blank;
               whereby his passion only grew the stronger. So some days passed;
               and the lady perceiving Pericone's constancy, and bethinking her that
               sooner or later she must yield either to force or to love, and gratify his
               passion, and judging by what she observed of the customs of the people
               that she was amongst Christians, and in a part where, were she able
               to speak their language, she would gain little by making herself
               known, determined with a lofty courage to stand firm and immovable
               in this extremity of her misfortunes. Wherefore she bade the
               three women, who were all that were left to her, on no account to let
               any know who they were, unless they were so circumstanced that
               they might safely count on assistance in effecting their escape: she
               also exhorted them most earnestly to preserve their chastity, averring
               that she was firmly resolved that none but her husband should enjoy
               her. The women heartily assented, and promised that her injunctions
               should be obeyed to the utmost of their power.
            </p>
            <p>Day by day Pericone's passion waxed more ardent, being fomented
               by the proximity and contrariety of its object. Wherefore seeing
               that blandishment availed nothing, he was minded to have recourse to
               wiles and stratagems, and in the last resort to force. 
               The lady,
               debarred by her law from the use of wine, found it, perhaps, on that
               account all the more palatable; which Pericone observing determined
               to enlist Bacchus in the service of Venus. So, ignoring her
               coyness, he provided one evening a supper, which was ordered with
               all possible pomp and beauty, and graced by the presence of the lady.
               No lack was there of incentives to hilarity; and Pericone directed
               the servant who waited on <span class="person">Alatiel</span> to ply her with divers sorts of
               blended wines; which command the man faithfully executed. She,
               suspecting nothing, and seduced by the delicious flavour of the
               liquor, drank somewhat more freely than was seemly, and forgetting
               her past woes, became frolicsome, and incited by some women who
               trod some measures in the <span class="place">Majorca</span>n style, she shewed the company
               how they footed it in <span class="place">Alexandria</span>. This novel demeanour was by no
               means lost on Pericone, who saw in it a good omen of his speedy
               success; so, with profuse relays of food and wine he prolonged the
               supper far into the night.
            </p>
            <p>When the guests were at length gone, he attended the lady alone
               to her chamber, where, the heat of the wine overpowering the cold
               counsels of modesty, she made no more account of Pericone's presence
               than if he had been one of her women, and forthwith undressed and
               went to bed. Pericone was not slow to follow her, and as soon as
               the light was out lay down by her side, and taking her in his arms,
               without the least demur on her part, began to solace himself with her
               after the manner of lovers; which experience--she knew not till then
               with what horn men butt--caused her to repent that she had not
               yielded to his blandishments; nor did she thereafter wait to be
               invited to such nights of delight, but many a time declared her readiness,
               not by words, for she had none to convey her meaning, but by
               gestures.
            </p>
            <p>But this great felicity which she now shared with Pericone was
               not to last: for not content with making her, instead of the consort
               of a king, the mistress of a castellan, Fortune had now in store for her
               a harsher experience, though of an amorous character. Pericone had
               a brother, twenty-five years of age, fair and fresh as a rose, his name
               <span class="person">Marato</span>. On sight of <span class="person">Alatiel</span> <span class="person">Marato</span> had been mightily taken with
               her; he inferred from her bearing that he stood high in her good
               graces; he believed that nothing stood between him and the gratification
               of his passion but the jealous vigilance with which Pericone
               guarded her. So musing, he hit upon a ruthless expedient, which
               had effect in action as hasty as heinous.
            </p>
            <p>It so chanced that there then lay in the port of the city a ship,
               commanded by two Genoese, bound with a cargo of merchandise for
               Klarenza in the <span class="place">Morea</span>: her sails were already hoist; and she tarried
               only for a favourable breeze. <span class="person">Marato</span> approached the masters and
               arranged with them to take himself and the lady aboard on the
               following night. This done he concerted further action with some
               of his most trusty friends, who readily lent him their aid to carry his
               design into execution. So on the following evening towards nightfall,
               the conspirators stole unobserved into Pericone's house, which
               was entirely unguarded, and there hid themselves, as pre-arranged.
               Then, as the night wore on, <span class="person">Marato</span> shewed them where Pericone
               and the lady slept, and they entered the room, and slew Pericone.
               The lady thus rudely roused wept; but silencing her by menaces of
               death they carried her off with the best part of Pericone's treasure,
               and hied them unobserved to the coast, where <span class="person">Marato</span> parted from his
               companions, and forthwith took the lady aboard the ship. The wind
               was now fair and fresh, the mariners spread the canvas, and the vessel
               sped on her course.
            </p>
            <p>This new misadventure, following so hard upon the former, caused
               the lady no small chagrin; but <span class="person">Marato</span>, with the aid of the good St.
               Crescent-in-hand that God has given us, found means to afford her
               such consolation that she was already grown so familiar with him as
               entirely to forget Pericone, when Fortune, not content with her
               former caprices, added a new dispensation of woe; for what with
               the beauty of her person, which, as we have often said, was extraordinary,
               and the exquisite charm of her manners, the two young
               men, who commanded the ship, fell so desperately in love with her
               that they thought of nothing but how they might best serve and
               please her, so only that <span class="person">Marato</span> should not discover the reason of their
               assiduous attentions. And neither being ignorant of the other's love,
               they held secret counsel together, and resolved to make conquest of
               the lady on joint account: as if love admitted of being held in partnership
               like merchandise or money. Which design being thwarted
               by the jealousy with which <span class="person">Alatiel</span> was guarded by <span class="person">Marato</span>, they
               chose a day and hour, when the ship was speeding amain under canvas,
               and <span class="person">Marato</span> was on the poop looking out over the sea and quite off
               his guard; and going stealthily up behind him, they suddenly laid
               hands on him, and threw him into the sea, and were already more
               than a mile on their course before any perceived that <span class="person">Marato</span> was
               overboard. Which when the lady learned, and knew that he was
               irretrievably lost, she relapsed into her former plaintive mood. 
               But
               the twain were forthwith by her side with soft speeches and profuse
               promises, which, however ill she understood them, were not altogether
               inapt to allay a grief which had in it more of concern for her own
               hapless self than of sorrow for her lost lover. So, in course of time,
               the lady beginning visibly to recover heart, they began privily to
               debate which of them should first take her to bed with him; and
               neither being willing to give way to the other, and no compromise
               being discoverable, high words passed between them, and the dispute
               grew so hot, that they both waxed very wroth, drew their knives, and
               rushed madly at one another, and before they could be parted by their
               men, several stabs had been given and received on either side, whereby
               the one fell dead on the spot, and the other was severely wounded in
               divers parts of the body. The lady was much disconcerted to find
               herself thus alone with none to afford her either succour or counsel,
               and was mightily afraid lest the wrath of the kinsfolk and friends of
               the twain should vent itself upon her. From this mortal peril she
               was, however, delivered by the intercessions of the wounded man and
               their speedy arrival at Klarenza.
            </p>
            <p>As there she tarried at the same inn with her wounded lover, the
               fame of her great beauty was speedily bruited abroad, and reached the
               ears of the Prince of the <span class="place">Morea</span>, who was then staying there. The
               Prince was curious to see her, and having so done, pronounced her even
               more beautiful than rumour had reported her; nay, he fell in love
               with her in such a degree that he could think of nought else; and
               having heard in what guise she had come thither, he deemed that he
               might have her. While he was casting about how to compass his
               end, the kinsfolk of the wounded man, being apprised of the fact,
               forthwith sent her to him to the boundless delight, as well of the lady,
               who saw therein her deliverance from a great peril, as of the Prince.
               The royal bearing, which enhanced the lady's charms, did not escape
               the Prince, who, being unable to discover her true rank, set her down
               as at any rate of noble lineage; wherefore he loved her as much again
               as before, and shewed her no small honour, treating her not as his
               mistress but as his wife. So the lady, contrasting her present happy
               estate with her past woes, was comforted; and, as her gaiety revived,
               her beauty waxed in such a degree that all the <span class="place">Morea</span> talked of it and
               of little else: insomuch that the Prince's friend and kinsman, the
               young, handsome and gallant Duke of Athens, was smitten with a
               desire to see her, and taking occasion to pay the Prince a visit, as he
               was now and again wont to do, came to Klarenza with a goodly
               company of honourable gentlemen. The Prince received him with
               all distinction and made him heartily welcome, but did not at first
               shew him the lady. By and by, however, their conversation began
               to turn upon her and her charms, and the Duke asked if she were
               really so marvellous a creature as folk said. The Prince replied:
               Nay, but even more so; and thereof thou shalt have better assurance
               than my words, to wit, the witness of thine own eyes. 
               So, without
               delay, for the Duke was now all impatience, they waited on the lady,
               who was prepared for their visit, and received them very courteously
               and graciously. They seated her between them, and being debarred
               from the pleasure of conversing with her, for of their speech she
               understood little or nothing, they both, and especially the Duke, who
               was scarce able to believe that she was of mortal mould, gazed upon
               her in mute admiration; whereby the Duke, cheating himself with
               the idea that he was but gratifying his curiosity, drank with his eyes,
               unawares, deep draughts of the poisoned chalice of love, and, to his
               own lamentable hurt, fell a prey to a most ardent passion. 
               His first
               thought, when they had left her, and he had time for reflection, was
               that the Prince was the luckiest man in the world to have a creature so
               fair to solace him; and swayed by his passion, his mind soon inclined
               to divers other and less honourable meditations, whereof the issue was
               that, come what might, he would despoil the Prince of his felicity, and,
               if possible, make it his own. 
               This resolution was no sooner taken than,
               being of a hasty temperament, he cast to the winds all considerations
               of honour and justice, and studied only how to compass his end by
               craft. So, one day, as the first step towards the accomplishment of his
               evil purpose, he arranged with the Prince's most trusted chamberlain,
               one <span class="person">Ciuriaci</span>, that his horses and all other his personal effects should,
               with the utmost secrecy, be got ready against a possible sudden departure:
               and then at nightfall, attended by a single comrade (both
               carrying arms), he was privily admitted by <span class="person">Ciuriaci</span> into the Prince's
               chamber. It was a hot night, and the Prince had risen without
               disturbing the lady, and was standing bare to the skin at an open
               window fronting the sea, to enjoy a light breeze that blew thence.
               So, by preconcert with his comrade, the Duke stole up to the window,
               and in a trice ran the Prince through the body, and caught him up,
               and threw him out of the window. The palace was close by the
               sea, but at a considerable altitude above it, and the window, through
               which the Prince's body was thrown, looked over some houses, which,
               being sapped by the sea, had become ruinous, and were rarely or
               never visited by a soul; whereby, as the Duke had foreseen, the fall
               of the Prince's body passed, as indeed it could not but pass, unobserved.
               Thereupon the Duke's accomplice whipped out a halter,
               which he had brought with him for the purpose, and, making as if he
               were but in play, threw it round <span class="person">Ciuriaci</span>'s neck, drew it so tight that
               he could not utter a sound, and then, with the Duke's aid, strangled
               him, and sent him after his master. All this was accomplished, as the
               Duke knew full well, without awakening any in the palace, not even
               the lady, whom he now approached with a light, and holding it
               over the bed gently uncovered her person, as she lay fast asleep, and
               surveyed her from head to foot to his no small satisfaction; for fair
               as she had seemed to him dressed, he found her unadorned charms
               incomparably greater. As he gazed, his passion waxed beyond
               measure, and, reckless of his recent crime, and of the blood which
               still stained his hands, he got forthwith into the bed; and she, being
               too sound asleep to distinguish between him and the Prince, suffered
               him to lie with her.
            </p>
            <p>But, boundless as was his delight, it brooked no long continuance;
               so, rising, he called to him some of his comrades, by whom he had
               the lady secured in such manner that she could utter no sound, and
               borne out of the palace by the same secret door by which he had
               gained entrance; he then set her on horseback and in dead silence
               put his troop in motion, taking the road to Athens. He did not,
               however, venture to take the lady to Athens, where she would have
               encountered his Duchess--for he was married--but lodged her in a
               very beautiful villa which he had hard by the city overlooking the
               sea, where, most forlorn of ladies, she lived secluded, but with no lack
               of meet and respectful service.
            </p>
            <p>On the following morning the Prince's courtiers awaited his
               rising until none, but perceiving no sign of it, opened the doors,
               which had not been secured, and entered his bedroom. Finding it
               vacant, they supposed that the Prince was gone off privily somewhere
               to have a few days of unbroken delight with his fair lady; and so
               they gave themselves no further trouble. But the next day it so
               chanced that an idiot, roaming about the ruins where lay the corpses
               of the Prince and <span class="person">Ciuriaci</span>, drew the latter out by the halter and
               went off dragging it after him. The corpse was soon recognised by
               not a few, who, at first struck dumb with amazement, soon recovered
               sense enough to cajole the idiot into retracing his steps and shewing
               them the spot where he had found it; and having thus, to the
               immeasurable grief of all the citizens, discovered the Prince's body,
               they buried it with all honour. Needless to say that no pains were
               spared to trace the perpetrators of so heinous a crime, and that the
               absence and evidently furtive departure of the Duke of Athens
               caused him to be suspected both of the murder and of the abduction
               of the lady. So the citizens were instant with one accord that
               the Prince's brother, whom they chose as his successor, should exact
               the debt of vengeance; and he, having satisfied himself by further
               investigation that their suspicion was well founded, summoned to his
               aid his kinsfolk, friends and divers vassals, and speedily gathered a
               large, powerful and well-equipped army, with intent to make war
               upon the Duke of Athens. The Duke, being informed of his
               movements, made ready likewise to defend himself with all his
               power; nor had he any lack of allies, among whom the Emperor of
               <span class="place">Constantinople</span> sent his son, Constantine, and his nephew, Manuel,
               with a great and goodly force. The two young men were honourably
               received by the Duke, and still more so by the Duchess, who
               was Constantine's sister.
            </p>
            <p>Day by day war grew more imminent; and at last the Duchess
               took occasion to call Constantine and Manuel into her private
               chamber, and with many tears told them the whole story at large,
               explaining the casus belli, dilating on the indignity which she
               suffered
               at the hands of the Duke, if, as was believed, he really kept a mistress
               in secret, and beseeching them in most piteous accents to do the best
               they could to devise some expedient whereby the Duke's honour
               might be cleared, and her own peace of mind assured. The young
               men knew exactly how matters stood; and so, without wearying the
               Duchess with many questions, they did their best to console her, and
               succeeded in raising her hopes. Before taking their leave they
               learned from her where the lady was, whose marvellous beauty they
               had heard lauded so often; and being eager to see her, they besought
               the Duke to afford them an opportunity. Forgetful of what a like
               complaisance had cost the Prince, he consented, and next morning
               brought them to the villa where the lady lived, and with her and a
               few of his boon companions regaled them with a lordly breakfast,
               which was served in a most lovely garden. Constantine had no
               sooner seated himself and surveyed the lady, than he was lost in
               admiration, inly affirming that he had never seen so beautiful a
               creature, and that for such a prize the Duke, or any other man,
               might well be pardoned treachery or any other crime: he scanned
               her again and again, and ever with more and more admiration; whereby
               it fared with him even as it had fared with the Duke. He went
               away hotly in love with her, and dismissing all thought of the war,
               cast about for some method by which, without betraying his passion to
               any, he might devise some means of wresting the lady from the Duke.
            </p>
            <p>As he thus burned and brooded, the Prince drew dangerously
               near the Duke's dominions; wherefore order was given for an
               advance, and the Duke, with Constantine and the rest, marshalled
               his forces and led them forth from Athens to bar the Prince's passage
               of the frontier at certain points. Some days thus passed, during
               which Constantine, whose mind and soul were entirely absorbed by
               his passion for the lady, bethought him, that, as the Duke was no
               longer in her neighbourhood, he might readily compass his end. He
               therefore feigned to be seriously unwell, and, having by this pretext
               obtained the Duke's leave, he ceded his command to Manuel, and
               returned to his sister at Athens. He had not been there many days
               before the Duchess recurred to the dishonour which the Duke did
               her by keeping the lady; whereupon he said that of that, if she
               approved, he would certainly relieve her by seeing that the lady was
               removed from the villa to some distant place. The Duchess,
               supposing that Constantine was prompted not by jealousy of the
               Duke but by jealousy for her honour, gave her hearty consent to his
               plan, provided he so contrived that the Duke should never know that
               she had been privy to it; on which point Constantine gave her ample
               assurance. So, being authorised by the Duchess to act as he might
               deem best, he secretly equipped a light bark and manned her with
               some of his men, to whom he confided his plan, bidding them lie to
               off the garden of the lady's villa; and so, having sent the bark
               forward, he hied him with other of his men to the villa. He gained
               ready admission of the servants, and was made heartily welcome by
               the lady, who, at his desire, attended by some of her servants, walked
               with him and some of his comrades in the garden. By and by,
               feigning that he had a message for her from the Duke, he drew her
               aside towards a gate that led down to the sea, and which one of his
               confederates had already opened. A concerted signal brought the
               bark alongside, and to seize the lady and set her aboard the bark was
               but the work of an instant. Her retinue hung back as they heard
               Constantine menace with death whoso but stirred or spoke, and
               suffered him, protesting that what he did was done not to wrong the
               Duke but solely to vindicate his sister's honour, to embark with his
               men. The lady wept, of course, but Constantine was at her side,
               the rowers gave way, and the bark, speeding like a thing of life over
               the waves, made <span class="place">Egina</span> shortly after dawn. There Constantine and
               the lady landed, she still lamenting her fatal beauty, and took a
               little
               rest and pleasure. Then, re-embarking, they continued their voyage,
               and in the course of a few days reached <span class="place">Chios</span>, which Constantine,
               fearing paternal censure, and that he might be deprived of his fair
               booty, deemed a safe place of sojourn. So, after some days of repose
               the lady ceased to bewail her harsh destiny, and suffering Constantine
               to console her as his predecessors had done, began once more to enjoy
               the good gifts which Fortune sent her.
            </p>
            <p>Now while they thus dallied, Osbech, King of the Turks, who
               was perennially at war with the Emperor, came by chance to
               <span class="place">Smyrna</span>; and there learning that Constantine was wantoning in
               careless ease at <span class="place">Chios</span> with a lady of whom he had made prize, he
               made a descent by night upon the island with an armed flotilla.
               Landing his men in dead silence, he made captives of not a few of
               the Chians whom he surprised in their beds; others, who took the
               alarm and rushed to arms, he slew; and having wasted the whole
               island with fire, he shipped the booty and the prisoners, and sailed
               back to <span class="place">Smyrna</span>. As there he overhauled the booty, he lit upon the
               fair lady, and knew her for the same that had been taken in bed
               and fast asleep with Constantine: whereat, being a young man,
               he was delighted beyond measure, and made her his wife out of
               hand with all due form and ceremony. And so for several months
               he enjoyed her.
            </p>
            <p>Now there had been for some time and still was a treaty pending
               between the Emperor and <span class="person">Basano</span>, King of <span class="place">Cappadocia</span>, whereby
               <span class="person">Basano</span> with his forces was to fall on Osbech on one side while the
               Emperor attacked him on the other. Some demands made by
               <span class="person">Basano</span>, which the Emperor deemed unreasonable, had so far retarded
               the conclusion of the treaty; but no sooner had the Emperor learned
               the fate of his son than, distraught with grief, he forthwith conceded
               the King of <span class="place">Cappadocia</span>'s demands, and was instant with him to fall
               at once upon Osbech while he made ready to attack him on the other
               side. Getting wind of the Emperor's design, Osbech collected his
               forces, and, lest he should be caught and crushed between the convergent
               armies of two most mighty potentates, advanced against the
               King of <span class="place">Cappadocia</span>. The fair lady he left at <span class="place">Smyrna</span> in the care of
               a faithful dependant and friend, and after a while joined battle with
               the King of <span class="place">Cappadocia</span>, in which battle he was slain, and his army
               defeated and dispersed. Wherefore <span class="person">Basano</span> with his victorious host
               advanced, carrying everything before him, upon <span class="place">Smyrna</span>, and receiving
               everywhere the submission due to a conqueror.
            </p>
            <p>Meanwhile Osbech's dependant, by name <span class="person">Antioco</span>, who had
               charge of the fair lady, was so smitten with her charms that, albeit
               he was somewhat advanced in years, he broke faith with his friend
               and lord, and allowed himself to become enamoured of her. He had
               the advantage of knowing her language, which counted for much with
               one who for some years had been, as it were, compelled to live the
               life of a deaf mute, finding none whom she could understand or by
               whom she might be understood; and goaded by passion, he in the
               course of a few days established such a degree of intimacy with her
               that in no long time it passed from friendship into love, so that their
               lord, far away amid the clash of arms and the tumult of the battle,
               was forgotten, and marvellous pleasure had they of one another
               between the sheets.
            </p>
            <p>However, news came at last of Osbech's defeat and death, and
               the victorious and unchecked advance of <span class="person">Basano</span>, whose advent they
               were by no means minded to await. Wherefore, taking with them
               the best part of the treasure that Osbech had left there, they hied
               them with all possible secrecy to <span class="place">Rhodes</span>. There they had not along
               abode before <span class="person">Antioco</span> fell ill of a mortal disease. He had then with
               him a Cypriote merchant, an intimate and very dear friend, to whom,
               as he felt his end approach, he resolved to leave all that he possessed,
               including his dear lady. So, when he felt death imminent, he called
               them to him and said: 'Tis now quite evident to me that my life
               	is fast ebbing away; and sorely do I regret it, for never had I so much
               	pleasure of life as now. Well content indeed I am in one respect,
               	in that, as die I must, I at least die in the arms of the two persons
               	whom I love more than any other in the world, to wit, in thine
               	arms, dearest friend, and those of this lady, whom, since I have
               	known her, I have loved more than myself. But yet 'tis grievous to
               	me to know that I must leave her here in a strange land with none
               	to afford her either protection or counsel; and but that I leave her
               	with thee, who, I doubt not, wilt have for my sake no less care of her
               	than thou wouldst have had of me, 'twould grieve me still more;
               	wherefore with all my heart and soul I pray thee, that, if I die, thou
               	take her with all else that belongs to me into thy charge, and so
               	acquit thyself of thy trust as thou mayst deem conducive to
               	the peace of my soul. And of thee, dearest lady, I entreat one
               	favour, that I be not forgotten of thee, after my death, so that there
               	whither I go it may still be my boast to be beloved here of the
               	most beautiful lady that nature ever formed. Let me but die
               	with these two hopes assured, and without doubt I shall depart in
               	peace.
            </p>
            <p>Both the merchant and the lady wept to hear him thus speak,
               and, when he had done, comforted him, and promised faithfully, in the
               event of his death, to do even as he besought them. He died almost
               immediately afterwards, and was honourably buried by them. A
               few days sufficed the merchant to wind up all his affairs in <span class="place">Rhodes</span>;
               and being minded to return to <span class="place">Cyprus</span> aboard a Catalan boat that was
               there, he asked the fair lady what she purposed to do if he went back
               to <span class="place">Cyprus</span>. The lady answered, that, if it were agreeable to him, she
               would gladly accompany him, hoping that for love of <span class="person">Antioco</span> he
               would treat and regard her as his sister. The merchant replied that
               it would afford him all the pleasure in the world; and, to protect her
               from insult until their arrival in <span class="place">Cyprus</span>, he gave her out as his wife,
               and, suiting action to word, slept with her on the boat in an alcove
               in a little cabin in the poop. Whereby that happened which on
               neither side was intended when they left <span class="place">Rhodes</span>, to wit, that the
               darkness and the comfort and the warmth of the bed, forces of no
               mean efficacy, did so prevail with them that dead <span class="person">Antioco</span> was forgotten
               alike as lover and as friend, and by a common impulse they
               began to wanton together, insomuch that before they were arrived
               at <span class="place">Baffa</span>, where the Cypriote resided, they were indeed man and wife.
               At <span class="place">Baffa</span> the lady tarried with the merchant a good while, 
               during
               which it so befell that a gentleman, Antigono by name, a man of
               ripe age and riper wisdom but no great wealth, being one that had
               had vast and various experience of affairs in the service of the King
               of <span class="place">Cyprus</span> but had found fortune adverse to him, came to <span class="place">Baffa</span> on
               business; and passing one day by the house where the fair lady was
               then living by herself, for the Cypriote merchant was gone to <span class="place">Armenia</span>
               with some of his wares, he chanced to catch sight of the lady at
               one of the windows, and, being struck by her extraordinary beauty,
               regarded her attentively, and began to have some vague recollection
               of having seen her before, but could by no means remember where.
               
               The fair lady, however, so long the sport of Fortune, but now nearing
               the term of her woes, no sooner saw Antigono than she remembered
               to have seen him in her father's service, and in no mean
               capacity, at <span class="place">Alexandria</span>. Wherefore she forthwith sent for him,
               hoping that by his counsel she might elude her merchant and be
               reinstated in her true character and dignity of princess. 
               When he
               presented himself, she asked him with some embarrassment whether
               he were, as she took him to be, Antigono of <span class="place">Famagosta</span>. 
               He answered
               in the affirmative, adding: And of you, madam, I have a sort of
               	recollection, though I cannot say where I have seen you; wherefore,
               	so it irk you not, bring, I pray you, yourself to my remembrance.
               Satisfied that it was Antigono himself, the lady in a flood of tears threw
               herself upon him to his no small amazement, and embraced his neck:
               then, after a little while, she asked him whether he had never seen
               her in <span class="place">Alexandria</span>. The question awakened Antigono's memory; he
               at once recognised <span class="person">Alatiel</span>, the Soldan's daughter, whom he had thought
               to have been drowned at sea, and would have paid her due homage;
               but she would not suffer it, and bade him be seated with her for a
               while. Being seated, he respectfully asked her, how, and when and
               whence she had come thither, seeing that all <span class="place">Egypt</span> believed for
               certain that she had been drowned at sea some years before. 
               And
               	would that so it had been, said the lady, rather than I should
               	have led the life that I have led; and so doubtless will my father
               	say, if he shall ever come to know of it. And so saying, she
               burst into such a flood of tears that 'twas a wonder to see. 
               Wherefore
               Antigono said to her: Nay but, madam, be not distressed
               	before the occasion arises. I pray you, tell me the story of your
               	adventures, and what has been the tenor of your life; perchance
               	'twill prove to be no such matter but, God helping us, we may set it
               	all straight. Antigono, said the fair lady, when I saw thee,
               	'twas as if I saw my father, and 'twas the tender love by which I
               	am holden to him that prompted me to make myself known to thee,
               	though I might have kept my secret; and few indeed there are,
               	whom to have met would have afforded me such pleasure as this
               	which I have in meeting and recognising thee before all others;
               	wherefore I will now make known to thee as to a father that which
               	in my evil fortune I have ever kept close. If, when thou hast heard
               	my story, thou seest any means whereby I may be reinstated in my
               	
               	former honour, I pray thee use it. If not, disclose to none that thou
               	hast seen me or heard aught of me.
            </p>
            <p>Then, weeping between every word, she told him her whole
               story from the day of the shipwreck at <span class="place">Majorca</span> to that hour.
               Antigono wept in sympathy, and then said: Madam, as throughout
               	this train of misfortunes you have happily escaped recognition, I
               	undertake to restore you to your father in such sort that you shall be
               	dearer to him than ever before, and be afterwards married to the King
               	of Algarve. How? she asked. Whereupon he explained to her
               	in detail how he meant to proceed; and, lest delay should give
               	occasion to another to interfere, he went back at once to <span class="place">Famagosta</span>,
               	and having obtained audience of the King, thus he spoke: Sire,
               	  so please you, you have it in your power at little cost to yourself to
               	  do a thing, which will at once redound most signally to your honour
               	  and confer a great boon on me, who have grown poor in your
               	  service. 
               	How? asked the King. Then said Antigono: 
               	At
               	  <span class="place">Baffa</span> is of late arrived a fair damsel, daughter of the Soldan, long
               	  thought to be drowned, who to preserve her chastity has suffered
               	  long and severe hardship. She is now reduced to poverty, and is
               	  desirous of returning to her father. If you should be pleased to send
               	  her back to him under my escort, your honour and my interest would
               	  be served in high and equal measure; nor do I think that such a
               	  service would ever be forgotten by the Soldan.
               
            </p>
            <p>With true royal generosity the King forthwith signified his
               approval, and had <span class="person">Alatiel</span> brought under honourable escort to <span class="place">Famagosta</span>,
               where, attended by his Queen, he received her with every
               circumstance of festal pomp and courtly magnificence. Schooled by
               Antigono, she gave the King and Queen such a version of her
               adventures as satisfied their inquiries in every particular. 
               So, after a
               few days, the King sent her back to the Soldan under escort of
               Antigono, attended by a goodly company of honourable men and
               women; and of the cheer which the Soldan made her, and not her
               only but Antigono and all his company, it boots not to ask. When she
               was somewhat rested, the Soldan inquired how it was that she was
               yet alive, and where she had been so long without letting him know
               how it fared with her. Whereupon the lady, who had got Antigono's
               lesson by heart, answered thus: </p>
               <div class="nested">My father, 'twas perhaps the
                  	twentieth night after my departure from you when our ship parted her
                  	timbers in a terrible storm and went ashore nigh a place called
                  	<span class="place">Aguamorta</span>, away there in the West: what was the fate of the men
                  	that were aboard our ship I know not, nor knew I ever; 
                  	I remember
                  	only, that, when day came, and I returned, as it were, from death to
                  	life, the wreck, having been sighted, was boarded by folk from all the
                  	country-side, intent on plunder; and I and two of my women were
                  	taken ashore, where the women were forthwith parted from me by
                  	the young men, nor did I ever learn their fate. Now hear my own.
                  	Struggling might and main, I was seized by two young men, who
                  	dragged me, weeping bitterly, by the hair of the head, towards a
                  	great forest; but, on sight of four men who were then passing that
                  	way on horseback, they forthwith loosed me and took to flight.
                  	Whereupon the four men, who struck me as persons of great
                  	authority, ran up to me; and much they questioned me, and much I
                  	said to them; but neither did they understand me, nor I them. So,
                  	after long time conferring together, they set me on one of their
                  	horses and brought me to a house, where dwelt a community of
                  	ladies, religious according to their law; and what the men may have
                  	said I know not, but there I was kindly received and ever honourably
                  	entreated by all; and with them I did afterwards most reverentially
                  	pay my devotions to St. Crescent-in-Hollow, who is held in great
                  	honour by the women of that country. When I had been some
                  	time with them, and had learned something of their language, they
                  	asked me who and whence I was: whereto I, knowing that I was in
                  	a convent, and fearing to be cast out as a foe to their law if I told the
                  	truth, answered that I was the daughter of a great gentleman of
                  	<span class="place">Cyprus</span>, who had intended to marry me to a gentleman of <span class="place">Crete</span>;
                  	but that on the voyage we had been driven out of our course and
                  	wrecked at <span class="place">Aguamorta</span>. And so I continued, as occasion required,
                  	observing their usages with much assiduity, lest worse should befall
                  	me; but being one day asked by their superior, whom they call
                  abbess, whether I was minded to go back to <span class="place">Cyprus</span>, I answered that
                  	there was nought that I desired so much. However, so solicitous for
                  	my honour was the abbess, that there was none going to <span class="place">Cyprus</span> to
                  	whom she would entrust me, until, two months or so ago, there
                  	arrived some worthy men from <span class="place">France</span>, of whom one was a kinsman
                  	of the abbess, with their wives. They were on their way to visit the
                  	sepulchre where He whom they hold to be God was buried after He
                  	had suffered death at the hands of the Jews; and the abbess, learning
                  	their destination, prayed them to take charge of me, and restore me
                  	to my father in <span class="place">Cyprus</span>. With what cheer, with what honour, these
                  	gentlemen and their wives entertained me, 'twere long to tell. But,
                  	in brief, we embarked, and in the course of a few days arrived at
                  	<span class="place">Baffa</span>, where it was so ordered by the providence of God, who perchance
                  	took pity on me, that in the very hour of our disembarkation
                  	I, not knowing a soul and being at a loss how to answer the gentlemen,
                  	who would fain have discharged the trust laid upon them by
                  	the reverend abbess and restored me to my father, fell in, on the
                  	shore, with Antigono, whom I forthwith called, and in our language,
                  	that I might be understood neither of the gentlemen nor of their
                  	wives, bade him acknowledge me as his daughter. He understood
                  	my case at once, made much of me, and to the utmost of his
                  	slender power honourably requited the gentlemen. He then brought
                  	me to the King of <span class="place">Cyprus</span>, who accorded me welcome there and
                  	conduct hither so honourable as words of mine can never describe. It
                  	aught remains to tell, you may best learn it from the lips of Antigono,
                  	who has often heard my story.
               </div>
               
            
            <p>Then Antigono, addressing the Soldan, said: Sire, what she
               has told you accords with what she has often told me, and with
               what I have learned from the gentlemen and ladies who accompanied
               her. One thing, however, she has omitted, because, I suppose, it
               hardly becomes her to tell it; to wit, all that the gentlemen and
               ladies, who accompanied her, said of the virtuous and gracious and
               noble life which she led with the devout ladies, and of the tears and
               wailings of both the ladies and the gentlemen, when they parted
               with her to me. But were I to essay to repeat all that they said to
               me, the day that now is, and the night that is to follow, were all too
               short: suffice it to say so much as this, that, by what I gathered
               from their words and have been able to see for myself, you may make
               it your boast, that among all the daughters of all your peers that
               wear the crown none can be matched with yours for virtue and true
               worth.

            <p>By all which the Soldan was so overjoyed that 'twas a wonder to
               see. Again and again he made supplication to God, that of His
               grace power might be vouchsafed him adequately to recompense all
               who had done honour to his daughter, and most especially the King
               of <span class="place">Cyprus</span>, for the honourable escort under which he had sent her
               thither; for Antigono he provided a magnificent guerdon, and some
               days later gave him his congè to return to <span class="place">Cyprus</span>, at the same
               time
               by a special ambassage conveying to the King his grateful acknowledgments
               of the manner in which he had treated his daughter.
               Then, being minded that his first intent, to wit, that his daughter
               should be the bride of the King of Algarve, should not be frustrate,
               he wrote to the King, telling him all, and adding that, if he were
               still minded to have her, he might send for her. The King was
               overjoyed by these tidings, and having sent for her with great pomp,
               gave her on her arrival a hearty welcome. So she, who had lain
               with eight men, in all, perhaps, ten thousand times, was bedded with
               him as a virgin, and made him believe that a virgin she was, and
               lived long and happily with him as his queen: wherefore 'twas
               said: Mouth, for kisses, was never the worse: like as the moon
               reneweth her course.

            <p>That, after the transference of the Roman Empire from the
               Franks to the Germans, the greatest enmity prevailed between the
               two nations, with warfare perpetual and relentless: wherefore,
               deeming that the offensive would be their best defence, the King of
               <span class="place">France</span> and his son mustered all the forces they could raise from
               their own dominions and those of their kinsmen and allies, and
               arrayed a grand army for the subjugation of their enemies. Before
               they took the field, as they could not leave the realm without a
               governor, they chose for that office Gautier, Count of Antwerp, a
               true knight and sage counsellor, and their very loyal ally and vassal,
               choosing him the rather, because, albeit he was a thorough master of
               the art of war, yet they deemed him less apt to support its hardships
               than for the conduct of affairs of a delicate nature. Him, therefore,
               they set in their place as their vicar-general and regent of the whole
               realm of <span class="place">France</span>, and having so done, they took the field.
            </p>
            <p>Count Gautier ordered his administration wisely and in a regular
               course, discussing all matters with the queen and her daughter-in-law;
               whom, albeit they were left under his charge and jurisdiction,
               he nevertheless treated as his ladies paramount. The Count was
               about forty years of age, and the very mould of manly beauty; in
               bearing as courteous and chivalrous as ever a gentleman might be,
               and withal so debonair and dainty, so feat and trim of person that
               he had not his peer among the gallants of that day. His wife was
               dead, leaving him two children and no more, to wit, a boy and a
               girl, still quite young. Now the King and his son being thus away
               at the war, and the Count frequenting the court of the two said
               ladies, and consulting with them upon affairs of state, it so befell
               that the Prince's lady regarded him with no small favour, being very
               sensible alike of the advantages of his person and the nobility of his
               bearing; whereby she conceived for him a passion which was all the
               more ardent because it was secret. And, as he was without a wife,
               and she was still in the freshness of her youth, she saw not why she
               should not readily be gratified; but supposing that nothing stood in
               the way but her own shamefastness, she resolved to be rid of that,
               and disclose her mind to him without any reserve. So one day,
               when she was alone, she seized her opportunity, and sent for him, as
               if she were desirous to converse with him on indifferent topics. The
               Count, his mind entirely aloof from the lady's purpose, presented
               himself forthwith, and at her invitation sate down by her side on a
               settee. They were quite alone in the room; but the Count had
               twice asked her the reason why she had so honoured him, before,
               overcome by passion, she broke silence, and crimson from brow to
               neck with shame, half sobbing, trembling in every limb, and faltering
               at every word, she thus spoke: 
               Dearest friend and sweet my lord,
               sagacity such as yours cannot but be apt to perceive how great is the
               frailty of men and women, and how, for divers reasons, it varies in
               different persons in such a degree that no just judge would mete
               out the same measure to each indifferently, though the fault were
               apparently the same. 
               Who would not acknowledge that a poor man
               or woman, fain to earn daily bread by the sweat of the brow, is far
               more reprehensible in yielding to the solicitations of love, than a
               rich lady, whose life is lapped in ease and unrestricted luxury? 
               Not
               a soul, I am persuaded, but would so acknowledge! Wherefore I
               deem that the possession of these boons of fortune should go far
               indeed to acquit the possessor, if she, perchance, indulge an errant
               love; and, for the rest, that, if she have chosen a wise and worthy
               lover, she should be entirely exonerated. 
               And as I think I may
               fairly claim the benefit of both these pleas, and of others beside, to
               wit, my youth and my husband's absence, which naturally incline me
               to love, 'tis meet that I now urge them in your presence in defence
               of my passion; and if they have the weight with you which they
               should have with the wise, I pray you to afford me your help and
               counsel in the matter wherein I shall demand it. I avow that in the
               absence of my husband I have been unable to withstand the promptings
               of the flesh and the power of love, forces of such potency that
               even the strongest men--not to speak of delicate women--have not
               seldom been, nay daily are, overcome by them; and so, living thus,
               as you see me, in ease and luxury, I have allowed the allurements of
               love to draw me on until at last I find myself a prey to passion.
               Wherein were I discovered, I were, I confess, dishonoured; but
               discovery being avoided, I count the dishonour all but nought.
               Moreover, love has been so gracious to me that not only has he
               spared to blind me in the choice of my lover, but he has even lent me
               his most effective aid, pointing me to one well worthy of the love of
               a lady such as I, even to yourself; whom, if I misread not my
               mind, I deem the most handsome and courteous and debonair, and
               therewithal the sagest cavalier that the realm of <span class="place">France</span> may shew.
               And as you are without a wife, so may I say that I find myself
               without a husband. Wherefore in return for this great love I bear
               you, deny me not, I pray you, yours; but have pity on my youth,
               which wastes away for you like ice before the fire.
            </p>
            <p>These words were followed by such a flood of tears, that, albeit
               she had intended yet further to press her suit, speech failed her; her
               eyes drooped, and, almost swooning with emotion, she let her head
               fall upon the Count's breast. The Count, who was the most loyal
               of knights, began with all severity to chide her mad passion and to
               thrust her from him--for she was now making as if she would throw
               her arms around his neck--and to asseverate with oaths that he
               would rather be hewn in pieces than either commit, or abet another
               in committing such an offence against the honour of his lord; 
               when
               the lady, catching his drift, and forgetting all her love in a sudden
               frenzy of rage, cried out: So! unknightly knight, is it thus you
               flout my love? Now Heaven forbid, but, as you would be the death
               of me, I either do you to death or drive you from the world! 
               So
               saying, she dishevelled and tore her hair and rent her garments to
               shreds about her bosom. Which done, she began shrieking at the top
               of her voice: Help! help! The Count of Antwerp threatens to
               violate me! 
               Whereupon the Count, who knew that a clear conscience
               was no protection against the envy of courtiers, and doubted that
               his innocence would prove scarce a match for the cunning of the
               lady, started to his feet, and hied him with all speed out of the room,
               out of the palace, and back to his own house. Counsel of none he
               sought; but forthwith set his children on horseback, and taking
               horse himself, departed post haste for <span class="place">Calais</span>. 
               The lady's cries
               brought not a few to her aid, who, observing her plight, not only
               gave entire credence to her story, but improved upon it, alleging that
               the debonair and accomplished Count had long employed all the arts
               of seduction to compass his end. So they rushed in hot haste to the
               Count's house, with intent to arrest him, and not finding him, sacked
               it and razed it to the ground. 
               The news, as glosed and garbled,
               being carried to the King and Prince in the field, they were mightily
               incensed, and offered a great reward for the Count, dead or alive, and
               condemned him and his posterity to perpetual banishment.
            </p>
            <p>Meanwhile the Count, sorely troubled that by his flight his
               innocence shewed as guilt, pursued his journey, and concealing his
               identity, and being recognised by none, arrived with his two children
               at <span class="place">Calais</span>. Thence he forthwith crossed to <span class="place">England</span>, and, meanly
               clad, fared on for <span class="place">London</span>, taking care as he went to school his
               children in all that belonged to their new way of life, and especially
               in two main articles: to wit, that they should bear with resignation
               the poverty to which, by no fault of theirs, but solely by one of
               Fortune's caprices, they and he were reduced, and that they should
               be most sedulously on their guard to betray to none, as they valued
               their lives, whence they were, or who their father was. 
               The son,
               Louis by name, was perhaps nine, and the daughter, Violante, perhaps
               seven years of age. For years so tender they proved apt pupils, and
               afterwards shewed by their conduct that they had well learned their
               father's lesson. He deemed it expedient to change their names, and
               accordingly called the boy Perrot and the girl Jeannette. So, meanly
               clad, the Count and his two children arrived at <span class="place">London</span>, and there
               made shift to get a living by going about soliciting alms in the guise
               of French mendicants.
            </p>
            <p>Now, as for this purpose they waited one morning outside a
               church, it so befell that a great lady, the wife of one of the marshals
               of the King of <span class="place">England</span>, observed them, as she left the church, asking
               alms, and demanded of the Count whence he was, and whether
               the children were his. He answered that he was from <span class="place">Picardy</span>, that
               the children were his, and that he had been fain to leave <span class="place">Picardy</span> by
               reason of the misconduct of their reprobate elder brother. 
               The lady
               looked at the girl, who being fair, and of gentle and winning mien
               and manners, found much favour in her eyes. So the kind-hearted
               lady said to the Count: My good man, if thou art willing to
               	leave thy little daughter with me, I like her looks so well that I will
               	gladly take her; and if she grow up a good woman, I will see that
               	she is suitably married when the right time comes. 
               The Count
               was much gratified by the proposal, which he forthwith accepted,
               and parted with the girl, charging the lady with tears to take every
               care of her.
            </p>
            <p>Having thus placed the girl with one in whom he felt sure that he
               might trust, he determined to tarry no longer in <span class="place">London</span>; wherefore,
               taking Perrot with him and begging as he went, he made his way
               to <span class="place">Wales</span>, not without great suffering, being unused to go afoot.
               Now in <span class="place">Wales</span> another of the King's marshals had his court, maintaining
               great state and a large number of retainers; to which court
               the Count and his son frequently repaired, there to get food; 
               and
               there Perrot, finding the marshal's son and other gentlemen's sons
               vying with one another in boyish exercises, as running and leaping,
               little by little joined their company, and shewed himself a match or
               more for them all in all their contests. The marshal's attention
               being thus drawn to him, he was well pleased with the boy's mien
               and bearing, and asked who he was. He was told that he was the
               son of a poor man who sometimes came there to solicit alms.
               Whereupon he asked the Count to let him have the boy, and the
               Count, to whom God could have granted no greater boon, readily
               consented, albeit he was very loath to part with Perrot.
            </p>
            <p>Having thus provided for his son and daughter, the Count
               resolved to quit the island; and did so, making his way as best he
               could to <span class="place">Stamford</span>, in <span class="place">Ireland</span>, where he obtained a menial's place in
               the service of a knight, retainer to one of the earls of that country,
               and so abode there a long while, doing all the irksome and wearisome
               drudgery of a lackey or groom.
            </p>
            <p>Meanwhile under the care of the gentle lady at <span class="place">London</span> Violante
               or Jeannette increased, as in years and stature so also in beauty, and
               in such favour with the lady and her husband and every other
               member of the household and all who knew her that 'twas a
               wonder to see; nor was there any that, observing her bearing and
               manners, would not have said that estate or dignity there was none so
               high or honourable but she was worthy of it. So the lady, who, since
               she had received her from her father, had been unable to learn aught
               else about him than what he had himself told, was minded to marry
               her honourably according to what she deemed to be her rank. 
               But
               God, who justly apportions reward according to merit, having
               regard to her noble birth, her innocence, and the load of suffering
               which the sin of another had laid upon her, ordered otherwise; and
               in His good providence, lest the young gentlewoman should be mated
               with a churl, permitted, we must believe, events to take the course
               they did.
            </p>
            <p>The gentle lady with whom Jeannette lived had an only son,
               whom she and her husband loved most dearly, as well because he was
               a son as for his rare and noble qualities, for in truth there were few
               that could compare with him in courtesy and courage and personal
               beauty. Now the young man marked the extraordinary beauty and
               grace of Jeannette, who was about six years his junior, and fell so
               desperately in love with her that he had no eyes for any other maiden;
               but, deeming her to be of low degree, he not only hesitated to ask her
               of his parents in marriage, but, fearing to incur reproof for indulging
               a passion for an inferior, he did his utmost to conceal his love.
               Whereby it gave him far more disquietude than if he had avowed
               it; insomuch that--so extreme waxed his suffering--he fell ill, and
               that seriously. Divers physicians were called in, but, for all their
               scrutiny of his symptoms, they could not determine the nature of
               his malady, and one and all gave him up for lost. Nothing could
               exceed the sorrow and dejection of his father and mother, who again
               and again piteously implored him to discover to them the cause of his
               malady, and received no other answer than sighs or complaints that
               he seemed to be wasting away. Now it so happened that one day,
               Jeannette, who from regard for his mother was sedulous in waiting
               upon him, for some reason or another came into the room where he
               lay, while a very young but very skilful physician sate by him and
               held his pulse. The young man gave her not a word or other sign
               of recognition; but his passion waxed, his heart smote him, and the
               acceleration of his pulse at once betrayed his inward commotion to
               the physician, who, albeit surprised, remained quietly attentive to see
               how long it would last, and observing that it ceased when Jeannette
               left the room, conjectured that he was on the way to explain the
               young man's malady. So, after a while, still holding the young
               man's pulse, he sent for Jeannette, as if he had something to ask
               of her. She returned forthwith; the young man's pulse mounted
               as soon as she entered the room, and fell again as soon as she left
               it. Wherefore the physician no longer hesitated, but rose, and
               taking the young man's father and mother aside, said to them:
               The restoration of your son's health rests not with medical skill,
               but solely with Jeannette, whom, as by unmistakable signs I have
               discovered, he ardently loves, though, so far I can see, she is not
               aware of it. So you know what you have to do, if you value his
               life. 
               The prospect thus afforded of their son's deliverance from
               death reassured the gentleman and his lady, albeit they were troubled,
               misdoubting it must be by his marriage with Jeannette. So, when
               the physician was gone, they went to the sick lad, and the lady
               thus spoke: My son, never would I have believed that thou
               wouldst have concealed from me any desire of thine, least of all
               if such it were that privation should cause thee to languish; for
               well assured thou shouldst have been and shouldst be, that I hold
               thee dear as my very self, and that whatever may be for thy
               contentment, even though it were scarce seemly, I would do it
               for thee; 
               but, for all thou hast so done, God has shewn Himself
               more merciful to theeward than thyself, and, lest thou die of this
               malady, has given me to know its cause, which is nothing else than
               the excessive love which thou bearest to a young woman, be she
               who she may. Which love in good sooth thou needest not have
               been ashamed to declare; for it is but natural at thy age; and
               hadst thou not loved, I should have deemed thee of very little
               worth. So, my son, be not shy of me, but frankly discover to me
               thy whole heart; and away with this gloom and melancholy
               whereof thy sickness is engendered, and be comforted, and assure
               thyself that there is nought that thou mayst require of me which
               I will not do to give thee ease, so far as my powers may reach,
               seeing that thou art dearer to me than my own life. Away with
               thy shamefastness and fears, and tell me if there is aught wherein
               I may be helpful to thee in the matter of thy love; and if I bestir
               not myself and bring it to pass, account me the most harsh mother
               that ever bore son.
            </p>
            <p>The young man was at first somewhat shamefast to hear his
               mother thus speak, but, reflecting that none could do more for his
               happiness than she, he took courage, and thus spoke: Madam,
               my sole reason for concealing my love from you was that I have
               observed that old people for the most part forget that they once were
               young; but, as I see that no such unreasonableness is to be apprehended
               in you, I not only acknowledge the truth of what you say
               that you have discerned, but I will also disclose to you the object of
               my passion, on the understanding that your promise shall to the best
               of your power be performed, as it must be, if I am to be restored to
               you in sound health. 
               Whereupon the lady, making too sure of that
               which was destined to fall out otherwise than she expected, gave him
               every encouragement to discover all his heart, and promised to lose
               no time and spare no pains in endeavouring to compass his gratification.
               Madam, said then the young man, the rare beauty and
               exquisite manners of our Jeannette, my powerlessness to make her
               understand--I do not say commiserate--my love, and my reluctance
               to disclose it to any, have brought me to the condition in which you
               see me; and if your promise be not in one way or another performed,
               be sure that my life will be brief. 
               The lady, deeming that the
               occasion called rather for comfort than for admonition, replied with a
               smile: Ah! my son, was this then of all things the secret of thy
               suffering? Be of good cheer, and leave me to arrange the affair,
               when you are recovered. 
               So, animated by a cheerful hope, the
               young man speedily gave sign of a most marked improvement, which
               the lady observed with great satisfaction, and then began to cast about
               how she might keep her promise. So one day she sent for Jeannette,
               and in a tone of gentle raillery asked her if she had a lover.
               Jeannette turned very red as she answered: Madam, 'twould scarce,
               nay, 'twould ill become a damsel such as I, poor, outcast from home,
               and in the service of another, to occupy herself with thoughts of
               love. 
               Whereto the lady answered: So you have none, we will
               give you one, who will brighten all your life and give you more joy
               of your beauty; for it is not right that so fair a damsel as you remain
               without a lover. 
               Madam, rejoined Jeannette, you found me
               living in poverty with my father, you adopted me, you have brought
               me up as your daughter; wherefore I should, if possible, comply with
               your every wish; but in this matter I will render you no compliance,
               nor do I doubt that I do well. So you will give me a husband, I
               will love him, but no other will I love; for, as patrimony I now have
               none save my honour, that I am minded to guard and preserve while
               my life shall last. 
               Serious though the obstacle was which these
               words opposed to the plan by which the lady had intended to keep
               her promise to her son, her sound judgment could not but secretly
               acknowledge that the spirit which they evinced was much to be
               commended in the damsel. Wherefore she said: Nay but,
               Jeannette; suppose that our Lord the King, who is a young knight
               as thou art a most fair damsel, craved some indulgence of thy
               love, wouldst thou deny him? 
               The King, returned Jeannette
               without the least hesitation, might constrain me, but with my
               consent he should never have aught of me that was not honourable.
               Whereto the lady made no answer, for she now understood the girl's
               temper; but, being minded to put her to the proof, she told her son
               that, as soon as he was recovered, she would arrange that he should
               be closeted with her in the same room, and be thus able to use all his
               arts to bring her to his will, saying that it ill became her to play the
               part of procuress and urge her son's suit upon her own maid. 
               But
               as the young man, by no means approving this idea, suddenly grew
               worse, the lady at length opened her mind to Jeannette, 
               whom she
               found in the same frame as before, and indeed even more resolute.
               Wherefore she told her husband all that she had done; and as both
               preferred that their son should marry beneath him, and live, than that
               he should remain single and die, they resolved, albeit much disconcerted,
               to give Jeannette to him to wife; and so after long debate
               they did. Whereat Jeannette was overjoyed, and with devout heart
               gave thanks to God that He had not forgotten her; nevertheless she
               still gave no other account of herself than that she was the daughter
               of a Picard. So the young man recovered, and blithe at heart as
               ne'er another, was married, and began to speed the time gaily with
               his bride.
            </p>
            <p>Meanwhile Perrot, left in <span class="place">Wales</span> with the marshal of the King
               of <span class="place">England</span>, had likewise with increase of years increase of favour
               with his master, and grew up most shapely and well-favoured, and of
               such prowess that in all the island at tourney or joust or any other
               passage of arms he had not his peer; being everywhere known and
               renowned as Perrot the Picard. And as God had not forgotten
               Jeannette, so likewise He made manifest by what follows that He had
               not forgotten Perrot. Well-nigh half the population of those parts
               being swept off by a sudden visitation of deadly pestilence, most of the
               survivors fled therefrom in a panic, so that the country was, to all
               appearance, entirely deserted. Among those that died of the pest
               were the marshal, his lady, and his son, besides brothers and nephews
               and kinsfolk in great number; whereby of his entire household there
               were left only one of his daughters, now marriageable, and a few
               servants, among them Perrot. Now Perrot being a man of such
               notable prowess, the damsel, soon after the pestilence had spent
               itself, took him, with the approval and by the advice of the few folk
               that survived, to be her husband, and made him lord of all that fell
               to her by inheritance. Nor was it long before the King of <span class="place">England</span>,
               learning that the marshal was dead, made Perrot the Picard, to whose
               merit he was no stranger, marshal in the dead man's room. Such,
               in brief, was the history of the two innocent children, with whom
               the Count of Antwerp had parted, never expecting to see them
               again.
            </p>
            <p>'Twas now the eighteenth year since the Count of Antwerp had
               taken flight from <span class="place">Paris</span>, when, being still in <span class="place">Ireland</span>, where he had
               led a very sorry and suffering sort of life, and feeling that age was
               now come upon him, he felt a longing to learn, if possible, what was
               become of his children. The fashion of his outward man was now
               completely changed; for long hardship had (as he well knew) given
               to his age a vigour which his youth, lapped in ease, had lacked. So
               he hesitated not to take his leave of the knight with whom he had
               so long resided, and poor and in sorry trim he crossed to <span class="place">England</span>,
               and made his way to the place where he had left Perrot--to find him
               a great lord and marshal of the King, and in good health, and withal
               a hardy man and very handsome. All which was very grateful to
               the old man; but yet he would not make himself known to his son,
               until he had learned the fate of Jeannette. So forth he fared again,
               nor did he halt until he was come to <span class="place">London</span>, where, cautiously
               questing about for news of the lady with whom he had left his
               daughter, and how it fared with her, he learned that Jeannette was
               married to the lady's son. Whereat, in the great gladness of his
               heart, he counted all his past adversity but a light matter, since
               he had found his children alive and prosperous. But sore he
               yearned to see Jeannette. Wherefore he took to loitering, as poor
               folk are wont, in the neighbourhood of the house. And so one
               day Jacques Lamiens--such was the name of Jeannette's husband--saw
               him and had pity on him, observing that he was poor and aged,
               and bade one of his servants take him indoors, and for God's sake
               give him something to eat; and nothing loath the servant did so.
               Now Jeannette had borne Jacques several children, the finest and the
               most winsome children in the world, the eldest no more than eight
               years old; who gathered about the Count as he ate, and, as if by
               instinct divining that he was their grandfather, began to make friends
               with him. He, knowing them for his grandchildren, could not
               conceal his love, and repaid them with caresses; insomuch that they
               would not hearken to their governor when he called them, but
               remained with the Count. Which being reported to Jeannette, she
               came out of her room, crossed to where the Count was sitting with
               the children, and bade them do as their master told them, or she
               would certainly have them whipped. The children began to cry,
               and to say that they would rather stay with the worthy man, whom
               they liked much better than their master; whereat both the lady and
               the Count laughed in sympathy. The Count had risen, with no
               other intention--for he was not minded to disclose his paternity--than
               to pay his daughter the respect due from his poverty to her
               rank, and the sight of her had thrilled his soul with a wondrous
               delight. By her he was and remained unrecognised; utterly
               changed as he was from his former self; aged, grey-haired, bearded,
               lean and tanned--in short to all appearance another man than the
               Count.
            </p>
            <p>However, seeing that the children were unwilling to leave him,
               but wept when she made as if she would constrain them, she bade
               the master let them be for a time. So the children remained with
               the worthy man, until by chance Jacques' father came home, and
               learned from the master what had happened. Whereupon, having a
               grudge against Jeannette, he said: Let them be; and God give
               them the ill luck which He owes them: whence they sprang, thither
               they must needs return; they descend from a vagabond on the
               mother's side, and so 'tis no wonder that they consort readily with
               vagabonds. 
               The Count caught these words and was sorely pained,
               but, shrugging his shoulders, bore the affront silently as he had borne
               many another. Jacques, who had noted his children's fondness for
               the worthy man, to wit, the Count, was displeased; but nevertheless,
               such was the love he bore them, that, rather than see them weep, he
               gave order that, if the worthy man cared to stay there in his service,
               he should be received. The Count answered that he would gladly
               do so, but that he was fit for nothing except to look after horses, to
               which he had been used all his life. So a horse was assigned him,
               and when he had groomed him, he occupied himself in playing with
               the children.
            </p>
            <p>While Fortune thus shaped the destinies of the Count of Antwerp
               and his children, it so befell that after a long series of truces
               made with the Germans the King of <span class="place">France</span> died, and his crown
               passed to his son, whose wife had been the occasion of the Count's
               banishment. The new king, as soon as the last truce with the
               Germans was run out, renewed hostilities with extraordinary vigour,
               being aided by his brother of <span class="place">England</span> with a large army under the
               command of his marshal, Perrot, and his other marshal's son,
               Jacques Lamiens. With them went the worthy man, that is to say,
               the Count, who, unrecognised by any, served for a long while in the
               army in the capacity of groom, and acquitted himself both in counsel
               and in arms with a wisdom and valour unwonted in one of his
               supposed rank. 
               The war was still raging when the Queen of <span class="place">France</span>
               fell seriously ill, and, as she felt her end approach, made a humble and
               contrite confession of all her sins to the Archbishop of <span class="place">Rouen</span>, who
               was universally reputed a good and most holy man. Among her other
               sins she confessed the great wrong that she had done to the Count
               of Antwerp; nor was she satisfied to confide it to the Archbishop,
               but recounted the whole affair, as it had passed, to not a few other
               worthy men, whom she besought to use their influence with the
               King to procure the restitution of the Count, if he were still alive,
               and if not, of his children, to honour and estate. And so, dying
               shortly afterwards, she was honourably buried. 
               The Queen's confession
               wrung from the King a sigh or two of compunction for a
               brave man cruelly wronged; after which he caused proclamation
               to be made throughout the army and in many other parts, that
               whoso should bring him tidings of the Count of Antwerp, or his
               children, should receive from him such a guerdon for each of them
               as should justly be matter of marvel; seeing that he held him
               acquitted, by confession of the Queen, of the crime for which he
               had been banished, and was therefore now minded to grant him not
               only restitution but increase of honour and estate.
            </p>
            <p>Now the Count, being still with the army in his character of
               groom, heard the proclamation, which he did not doubt was made
               in good faith. Wherefore he hied him forthwith to Jacques, and
               begged a private interview with him and Perrot, that he might discover
               to them that whereof the King was in quest. So the meeting
               was had; and Perrot was on the point of declaring himself, when
               the Count anticipated him: Perrot, he said, Jacques here has
               thy sister to wife, but never a dowry had he with her. Wherefore
               that thy sister be not dowerless, 'tis my will that he, and no other,
               have this great reward which the King offers for thee, son, as he
               shall certify, of the Count of Antwerp, and for his wife and thy
               sister, Violante, and for me, Count of Antwerp, thy father. 
               So
               hearing, Perrot scanned the Count closely, and forthwith recognising
               him, burst into tears, and throwing himself at his feet embraced
               him, saying: My father, welcome, welcome indeed art thou.
               Whereupon, between what he had heard from the Count and what
               he had witnessed on the part of Perrot, Jacques was so overcome
               with wonder and delight, that at first he was at a loss to know how
               to act. However, giving entire credence to what he had heard, and
               recalling insulting language which he had used towards the quondam
               groom, the Count, he was sore stricken with shame, and wept, and
               fell at the Count's feet, and humbly craved his pardon for all past
               offences; which the Count, raising him to his feet, most graciously
               granted him. So with many a tear and many a hearty laugh the
               three men compared their several fortunes; which done, Perrot and
               Jacques would have arrayed the Count in manner befitting his rank,
               but he would by no means suffer it, being minded that Jacques, so
               soon as he was well assured that the guerdon was forthcoming,
               should present him to the King in his garb of groom, that thereby
               the King might be the more shamed. So Jacques, with the Count
               and Perrot, went presently to the King and offered to present to him
               the Count and his children, provided the guerdon were forthcoming
               according to the proclamation. Jacques wondered not a little as
               forthwith at a word from the King a guerdon was produced ample
               for all three, and he was bidden take it away with him, so only that
               he should in very truth produce, as he had promised, the Count and
               his children in the royal presence. Then, withdrawing a little and
               causing his quondam groom, now Count, to come forward with
               Perrot, he said: Sire, father and son are before you; the daughter,
               my wife, is not here, but, God willing, you shall soon see her. 
               So
               hearing, the King surveyed the Count, whom, notwithstanding his
               greatly changed appearance, he at length recognised, and well-nigh
               moved to tears, he raised him from his knees to his feet, and kissed
               and embraced him. He also gave a kindly welcome to Perrot, and
               bade forthwith furnish the Count with apparel, servants and horses,
               suited to his rank; all which was no sooner said than done. 
               Moreover
               the King shewed Jacques no little honour, and particularly
               questioned him of all his past adventures.
            </p>
            <p>As Jacques was about to take the noble guerdons assigned him for
               the discovery of the Count and his children, the Count said to
               him: Take these tokens of the magnificence of our Lord the
               King, and forget not to tell thy father that 'tis from no vagabond
               that thy children, his and my grandchildren, descend on the mother's
               side. So Jacques took the guerdons, and sent for his wife and
               mother to join him at <span class="place">Paris</span>. Thither also came Perrot's wife: and
               there with all magnificence they were entertained by the Count, to
               whom the King had not only restored all his former estates and
               honours, but added thereto others, whereby he was now become a
               greater man than he had ever been before. Then with the
               Count's leave they all returned to their several houses. The
               Count himself spent the rest of his days at <span class="place">Paris</span> in greater glory
               than ever.

            <p>Know then that certain very great merchants of <span class="place">Italy</span>, being met,
               as merchants use, for divers reasons proper to each, at a hostelry in
               <span class="place">Paris</span>, and having one evening jovially supped together, fell a talking
               of divers matters, and so, passing from one topic to another, they
               came at last to discuss the ladies whom they had left at home, 
               and
               one jocosely said: I cannot answer for my wife; but for myself
               I own, that, whenever a girl that is to my mind comes in my way, I
               give the go-by to the love that I bear my wife, and take my pleasure
               of the new-comer to the best of my power. 
               And so do I, said
               another, because I know that, whether I suspect her or no, my wife
               tries her fortune, and so 'tis do as you are done by; the ass and the
               wall are quits. 
               A third added his testimony to the same effect;
               and in short all seemed to concur in the opinion that the ladies they
               had left behind them were not likely to neglect their opportunities,
               when one, a Genoese, Bernabò Lomellin by name, dissociated
               himself from the rest, affirming that by especial grace of God he was
               blessed with a wife who was, perhaps, the most perfect paragon to be
               found in <span class="place">Italy</span> of all the virtues proper to a lady, ay, and in great
               measure, to a knight or squire; inasmuch as she was fair, still quite
               young, handy, hardy, and clever beyond all other women in
               embroidery work and all other forms of lady's handicraft. 
               Moreover
               so well-mannered, discreet and sensible was she that she was as fit to
               wait at a lord's table as any squire or manservant or such like, the
               best and most adroit that could be found. To which encomium he
               added that she knew how to manage a horse, fly a hawk, read, write
               and cast up accounts better than as if she were a merchant; and after
               much more in the same strain of commendation he came at length to
               the topic of their conversation, asseverating with an oath that 'twas
               not possible to find a woman more honest, more chaste than she:
               nay, he verily believed that, if he remained from home for ten years,
               or indeed for the rest of his days, she would never think of any of
               these casual amours with any other man.
            </p>
            <p>Among the merchants who thus gossiped was a young man,
               Ambrogiuolo da Piacenza by name, who, when Bernabò thus concluded
               his eulogy of his wife, broke out into a mighty laugh, and
               asked him with a leer, whether he of all men had this privilege by
               special patent of the Emperor. Bernabò replied, somewhat angrily,
               that 'twas a boon conferred upon him by God, who was rather more
               powerful than the Emperor. To which Ambrogiuolo rejoined: I
               make no doubt, Bernabò, that thou believest that what thou sayst is
               true; but, methinks, thou hast been but a careless observer of the
               nature of things; otherwise, I do not take thee to be of so gross
               understanding but that thou must have discerned therein reasons
               for speaking more judiciously of this matter. And that thou
               mayst not think that we, who have spoken with much freedom
               about our wives, deem them to be of another nature and mould
               than thine, but mayst know that we have but uttered what
               common sense dictates, I am minded to go a little further into
               this matter with thee. I have always understood, that of all mortal
               beings created by God man is the most noble, and next after him
               woman: man, then, being, as is universally believed, and is indeed
               apparent by his works, more perfect than woman, must without
               doubt be endowed with more firmness and constancy, women being
               one and all more mobile, for reasons not a few and founded in nature,
               which I might adduce, but mean for the present to pass over. 
               And
               yet, for all his greater firmness, man cannot withstand--I do not say
               a woman's supplications, but--the mere lust of the eye which she
               unwittingly excites, and that in such sort that he will do all that is in
               his power to induce her to pleasure him, not once, perhaps, in the
               course of a month, but a thousand times a day. How, then, shouldst
               thou expect a woman, mobile by nature, to resist the supplications,
               the flatteries, the gifts, and all the other modes of attack that an
               accomplished seducer will employ? Thou thinkest that she may
               hold out! Nay verily, affirm it as thou mayst, I doubt thou dost not
               really so think. Thou dost not deny that thy wife is a woman, a
               creature of flesh and blood like the rest; and if so, she must have the
               same cravings, the same natural propensities as they, and no more
               force to withstand them; wherefore 'tis at least possible, that,
               however honest she be, she will do as others do; and nought that is
               possible admits such peremptory denial or affirmation of its contrary
               as this of thine.
            </p>
            <p>Whereto Bernabò returned: I am a merchant and no philosopher,
               and I will give thee a merchant's answer. I acknowledge
               that what thou sayst is true of vain and foolish women who have no
               modesty, but such as are discreet are so sensitive in regard of their
               honour that they become better able to preserve it than men,
               who have no such solicitude; and my wife is one of this sort.
               Doubtless, observed Ambrogiuolo, few would be found to indulge
               in these casual amours, if every time they did so a horn grew out on
               the brow to attest the fact; but not only does no horn make its
               appearance but not so much as a trace or vestige of a horn, so only
               they be but prudent; and the shame and dishonour consist only in
               the discovery: wherefore, if they can do it secretly, they do it, or are
               fools to refrain. 
               Hold it for certain that she alone is chaste who
               either had never suit made to her, or, suing herself, was repulsed.
               And albeit I know that for reasons true and founded in nature this
               must needs be, yet I should not speak so positively thereof as I do,
               had I not many a time with many a woman verified it by experience.
               And I assure thee that, had I but access to this most saintly wife of
               thine, I should confidently expect very soon to have the same success
               with her as with others. 
               Then Bernabò angrily: 'Twere long
               and tedious to continue this discussion. I should have my say, and
               thou thine, and in the end 'twould come to nothing. But, as thou
               sayst that they are all so compliant, and that thou art so accomplished
               a seducer, I give thee this pledge of the honour of my wife: I
               consent to forfeit my head, if thou shouldst succeed in bringing her
               to pleasure thee in such a sort; and shouldst thou fail, thou shalt
               forfeit to me no more than one thousand florins of gold.
            </p>
            <p>Elated by this unexpected offer, Ambrogiuolo replied: I know
               not what I should do with thy blood, Bernabò, if I won the wager;
               but, if thou wouldst have proof of what I have told thee, lay five
               thousand florins of gold, which must be worth less to thee than thy
               head, against a thousand of mine, and, whereas thou makest no
               stipulation as to time, I will bind myself to go to <span class="place">Genoa</span>, and within
               three months from my departure hence to have had my pleasure of
               thy wife, and in witness thereof to bring back with me, of the things
               which she prizes most dearly, evidence of her compliance so weighty
               and conclusive that thou thyself shalt admit the fact; nor do I
               require ought of thee but that thou pledge thy faith neither to come
               to <span class="place">Genoa</span> nor to write word to her of this matter during the said
               three months. 
               Bernabò professed himself well content; and though
               the rest of the company, seeing that the compact might well have
               very evil consequences, did all that they could to frustrate it, yet the
               two men were now so heated that, against the will of the others, they
               set it down fairly in writing, and signed it each with his own hand.
               This done, Ambrogiuolo, leaving Bernabò at <span class="place">Paris</span>, posted with all
               speed for <span class="place">Genoa</span>. Arrived there, he set to work with great caution;
               and having found out the quarter in which the lady resided, he
               learned in the course of a few days enough about her habits of life
               and her character to know that what Bernabò had told him was
               rather less than the truth. So, recognising that his enterprise was
               hopeless, he cast about for some device whereby he might cover his
               defeat; and having got speech of a poor woman, who was much in
               the lady's house, as also in her favour, he bribed her (other means
               failing) to convey him in a chest, which he had had made for the
               purpose, not only into the house but into the bedroom of the lady,
               whom the good woman, following Bernabò's instructions, induced to
               take charge of it for some days, during which, she said, she would be
               away.
            </p>
            <p>So the lady suffered the chest to remain in the room; and when
               the night was so far spent that Bernabò thought she must be asleep,
               he opened it with some tools with which he had provided himself,
               and stole softly out. There was a light in the room, so that he was
               able to form an idea of its situation, to take note of the pictures and
               everything else of consequence that it contained, and to commit the
               whole to memory. This done, he approached the bed; and observing
               that the lady, and a little girl that was with her, were fast asleep, he
               gently uncovered her, and saw that nude she was not a whit less
               lovely than when dressed: he looked about for some mark that might
               serve him as evidence that he had seen her in this state, but found
               nothing except a mole, which she had under the left breast, and
               which was fringed with a few fair hairs that shone like gold. So
               beautiful was she that he was tempted at the hazard of his life to
               take his place by her side in the bed; but, remembering what he had
               heard of her inflexible obduracy in such affairs, he did not venture;
               but quietly replaced the bedclothes; and having passed the best part
               of the night very much at his ease in her room, he took from one of
               the lady's boxes a purse, a gown, a ring and a girdle, and with these
               tokens returned to the chest, and locked himself in as before. In
               this manner he passed two nights, nor did the lady in the least
               suspect his presence. On the third day the good woman came by
               preconcert to fetch her chest, and took it back to the place whence
               she had brought it. So Ambrogiuolo got out, paid her the stipulated
               sum, and hied him back with all speed to <span class="place">Paris</span>, where he arrived
               within the appointed time. Then, in presence of the merchants
               who were witnesses of his altercation with Bernabò, and the
               wager
               to which it had given occasion, he told Bernabò that he had won
               the bet, having done what he had boasted that he would do; and in
               proof thereof he first of all described the appearance of the room and
               the pictures, and then displayed the articles belonging to the lady
               which he had brought away with him, averring that she had given
               them to him. Bernabò acknowledged the accuracy of his description
               of the room, and that the articles did really belong to his wife, but
               objected that Ambrogiuolo might have learned characteristic features
               of the room from one of the servants, and have come by the things
               in a similar way, and therefore, unless he had something more to say,
               he could not justly claim to have won the bet. 
               Verily, rejoined
               Ambrogiuolo, this should suffice; but, as thou requirest that I say
               somewhat further, I will satisfy thee. I say, then, that Madam
               Zinevra, thy wife, has under her left breast a mole of some size,
               around which are, perhaps, six hairs of a golden hue. 
               As Bernabò
               heard this, it was as if a knife pierced his heart, so poignant was his
               suffering; and, though no word escaped him, the complete alteration
               of his mien bore unmistakable witness to the truth of Ambrogiuolo's
               words. After a while he said: Gentlemen, 'tis even as Ambrogiuolo
               says; he has won the bet; he has but to come when
               he will, and he shall be paid. 
               And so the very next day
               Ambrogiuolo was paid in full, and Bernabò, intent on wreaking
               vengeance on his wife, left <span class="place">Paris</span> and set his face towards <span class="place">Genoa</span>.
               He had no mind, however, to go home, and accordingly halted at an
               estate which he had some twenty miles from the city, whither he
               sent forward a servant, in whom he reposed much trust, with two
               horses and a letter advising the lady of his return, and bidding her
               come out to meet him. At the same time he gave the servant
               secret instructions to choose some convenient place, and ruthlessly
               put the lady to death, and so return to him. 
               On his arrival at
               <span class="place">Genoa</span> the servant delivered his message and the letter to the lady,
               who received him with great cheer, and next morning got on
               horseback and set forth with him for her husband's estate. 
               So they
               rode on, talking of divers matters, until they came to a deep gorge,
               very lonely, and shut in by high rocks and trees. The servant,
               deeming this just the place in which he might without risk of
               discovery fulfil his lord's behest, whipped out a knife, and seizing
               the lady by the arm, said: Madam, commend your soul to God,
               for here must end at once your journey and your life. 
               Terror-stricken
               by what she saw and heard, the lady cried out: Mercy
               for God's sake; before thou slay me, tell me at least wherein I have
               wronged thee, that thou art thus minded to put me to death.
               Madam, said the servant, me you have in no wise wronged;
               but your husband--how you may have wronged him I know not--charged
               me shew you no mercy, but to slay you on this journey,
               and threatened to have me hanged by the neck, should I not do so.
               You know well how bound I am to him, and that I may not
               disobey any of his commands: God knows I pity you, but yet I can
               no otherwise. 
               Whereat the lady burst into tears, saying: Mercy
               for God's sake; make not thyself the murderer of one that has done
               thee no wrong, at the behest of another. The all-seeing God knows
               that I never did aught to merit such requital at my husband's hands.
               But enough of this for the present: there is a way in which thou
               canst serve at once God and thy master and myself, if thou wilt do
               as I bid thee: take, then, these clothes of mine and give me in
               exchange just thy doublet and a hood; and carry the clothes with
               thee to my lord and thine, and tell him that thou hast slain me;
               and I swear to thee by the life which I shall have received at thy
               hands, that I will get me gone, and there abide whence news of me
               shall never reach either him or thee or these parts. 
               The servant,
               being loath to put her to death, soon yielded to pity; and so he took
               her clothes, allowing her to retain a little money that she had, and
               gave her one of his worser doublets and a hood; then, praying her
               to depart the country, he left her afoot in the gorge, and returned
               to his master, whom he gave to understand that he had not only
               carried out his orders but had left the lady's body a prey to wolves.
               Bernabò after a while returned to <span class="place">Genoa</span>, where, the supposed
               murder being bruited abroad, he was severely censured.
            </p>
            <p>Alone and disconsolate, the lady, as night fell, disguised herself
               as best she could, and hied her to a neighbouring village, where,
               having procured what was needful from an old woman, she shortened
               the doublet and fitted it to her figure, converted her chemise into a
               pair of breeches, cut her hair close, and, in short, completely disguised
               herself as a sailor. She then made her way to the coast, where by
               chance she encountered a Catalan gentleman, by name Segner
               Encararch, who had landed from one of his ships, which lay in the
               offing, to recreate himself at <span class="place">Alba</span>, where there was a fountain. 
               So
               she made overture to him of her services, was engaged and taken
               aboard the ship, assuming the name Sicurano da Finale. The
               gentleman put her in better trim as to clothes, and found her so apt
               and handy at service that he was exceeding well pleased with her.
            </p>
            <p>Not long afterwards the Catalan sailed one of his carracks to
               <span class="place">Alexandria</span>. He took with him some peregrine falcons, which he
               presented to the Soldan, who feasted him once or twice; and noting
               with approbation the behaviour of Sicurano, who always attended
               his master, he craved him of the Catalan, which request the Catalan
               reluctantly granted. Sicurano proved so apt for his new service
               that he was soon as high in grace and favour with the Soldan as he
               had been with the Catalan. Wherefore, when the time of year
               came at which there was wont to be held at Acre, then under the
               Soldan's sway, a great fair, much frequented by merchants, Christian
               and Saracen alike, and to which, for the security of the merchants
               and their goods, the Soldan always sent one of his great officers of
               state with other officers and a guard to attend upon them, 
               he determined
               to send Sicurano, who by this time knew the language very
               well. 
               So Sicurano was sent to Acre as governor and captain of the
               guard for the protection of the merchants and merchandise. Arrived
               there, he bestirred himself with great zeal in all matters appertaining
               to his office; and as he went his rounds of inspection, he espied
               among the merchants not a few from <span class="place">Italy</span>, Sicilians, Pisans, Genoese,
               Venetians, and so forth, with whom he consorted the more readily
               because they reminded him of his native land. 
               And so it befell that,
               alighting once at a shop belonging to some Venetian merchants, he
               saw there among other trinkets a purse and a girdle, which he
               forthwith recognised as having once been his own. Concealing
               his surprise, he blandly asked whose they were, and if they were
               for sale. He was answered by Ambrogiuolo da Piacenza, who had
               come thither with much merchandise aboard a Venetian ship, and
               hearing that the captain of the guard was asking about the ownership
               of the purse and girdle, came forward, and said with a smile: The
               things are mine, Sir, and I am not disposed to sell them, but, if they
               take your fancy, I will gladly give them to you. 
               Observing the
               smile, Sicurano misdoubted that something had escaped him by
               which Ambrogiuolo had recognised him; but he answered with a
               composed air: Thou dost smile, perchance, to see me, a soldier,
               come asking about this woman's gear? 
               Not so, Sir, returned
               Ambrogiuolo; I smile to think of the manner in which I came
               by it. 
               And pray, said Sicurano, if thou hast no reason to
               conceal it, tell me, in God's name, how thou didst come by the
               things. 
               Why, Sir, said Ambrogiuolo, they were given me by
               a Genoese lady, with whom I once spent a night, Madam Zinevra
               by name, wife of Bernabò Lomellin, who prayed me to keep them
               as a token of her love. 
               I smiled just now to think of the folly of
               Bernabò, who was so mad as to stake five thousand florins of gold
               against my thousand that I could not bring his wife to surrender to
               me; which I did. I won the bet; and he, who should rather have
               been punished for his insensate folly, than she for doing what all
               women do, had her put to death, as I afterwards gathered, on his
               way back from <span class="place">Paris</span> to <span class="place">Genoa</span>.
            </p>
            <p>Ambrogiuolo had not done speaking before Sicurano had discerned
               in him the evident cause of her husband's animosity against
               her, and all her woe, and had made up her mind that he should
               not escape with impunity. She therefore feigned to be much
               interested by this story, consorted frequently and very familiarly
               with Ambrogiuolo, and insidiously captured his confidence, insomuch
               that at her suggestion, when the fair was done, he, taking with
               him all his wares, accompanied her to <span class="place">Alexandria</span>, where she
               provided him with a shop, and put no little of her own money in
               his hands; so that he, finding it very profitable, was glad enough
               to stay. Anxious to make her innocence manifest to Bernabò,
               Sicurano did not rest until, with the help of some great Genoese
               merchants that were in <span class="place">Alexandria</span>, she had devised an expedient
               to draw him thither. Her plan succeeded; Bernabò arrived; and,
               as he was now very poor, she privily arranged that he should be
               entertained by one of her friends until occasion should serve to carry
               out her design. She had already induced Ambrogiuolo to tell his
               story to the Soldan, and the Soldan to interest himself in the matter.
               So Bernabò being come, and further delay inexpedient, she seized
               her opportunity, and persuaded the Soldan to cite Ambrogiuolo and
               Bernabò before him, that in Bernabò's presence Ambrogiuolo
               might
               be examined of his boast touching Bernabò's wife, and the truth
               thereof, if not to be had from him by gentle means, be elicited by
               torture. So the Soldan, having Ambrogiuolo and Bernabò before
               him, amid a great concourse of his people questioned Ambrogiuolo
               of the five thousand florins of gold that he had won from Bernabò,
               and sternly bade him tell the truth. Still more harsh was the
               aspect of Sicurano, in whom Ambrogiuolo had placed his chief
               reliance, but who now threatened him with the direst torments if
               the truth were not forthcoming. Thus hard bested on this side and
               on that, and in a manner coerced, Ambrogiuolo, thinking he had
               but to refund, in presence of Bernabò and many others accurately
               recounted the affair as it had happened. When he had done, Sicurano,
               as minister of the Soldan for the time being, turned to Bernabò and
               said: And thy wife, thus falsely accused, what treatment did she
               meet with at thy hands? 
               Mortified, said Bernabò, by the
               loss
               of my money, and the dishonour which I deemed to have been
               done me by my wife, I was so overcome by wrath that I had her put
               to death by one of my servants, who brought me word that her
               corpse had been instantly devoured by a pack of wolves.
            </p>
            <p>Albeit the Soldan had heard and understood all that had passed,
               yet he did not as yet apprehend the object for which Sicurano had
               pursued the investigation. Wherefore Sicurano thus addressed him:
               My lord, what cause this good lady has to boast of her lover and
               her husband you have now abundant means of judging; seeing that
               the lover at one and the same time despoils her of her honour,
               blasting her fair fame with slanderous accusations, and ruins her
               husband; who, more prompt to trust the falsehood of another than
               the verity of which his own long experience should have assured
               him, devotes her to death and the devouring wolves; and, moreover,
               such is the regard, such the love which both bear her that, though
               both tarry a long time with her, neither recognises her. 
               However,
               that you may know full well what chastisements they have severally
               deserved, I will now cause her to appear in your presence and theirs,
               provided you, of your especial grace, be pleased to punish the deceiver
               and pardon the deceived. 
               The Soldan, being minded in this matter
               to defer entirely to Sicurano, answered that he was well content,
               and bade produce the lady. Bernabò, who had firmly believed that
               she was dead, was lost in wonder; likewise Ambrogiuolo, who now
               divined his evil plight, and dreading something worse than the
               disbursement of money, knew not whether to expect the lady's advent
               with fear or with hope. His suspense was not of long duration; 
               for,
               as soon as the Soldan signified his assent, Sicurano, weeping, threw
               herself on her knees at his feet, and discarding the tones, as she
               would fain have divested herself of the outward semblance, of a man,
               said: 
               .My lord, that forlorn, hapless Zinevra am I, falsely and
               foully slandered by this traitor Ambrogiuolo, and by my cruel
               and unjust husband delivered over to his servant to slaughter and
               cast out as a prey to the wolves; for which cause I have now for
               six years been a wanderer on the face of the earth in the guise of
               a man. 
               Then rending her robes in front and baring her breast, she
               made it manifest to the Soldan and all others who were present,
               that she was indeed a woman; then turning to Ambrogiuolo she
               haughtily challenged him to say when she had ever lain with him,
               as he had boasted. Ambrogiuolo said never a word, for he now
               recognised her, and it was as if shame had reft from him the power
               of speech. 
               The Soldan, who had never doubted that Sicurano was
               a man, was so wonder-struck by what he saw and heard that at
               times he thought it must be all a dream. But, as wonder gave
               place to conviction of the truth, he extolled in the amplest terms the
               constancy and virtue and seemliness with which Zinevra, erstwhile
               Sicurano, had ordered her life. 
               He then directed that she should
               be most nobly arrayed in the garb of her sex and surrounded by a
               bevy of ladies. Mindful of her intercession, he granted to Bernabò
               the life which he had forfeited; and she, when Bernabò threw
               himself at her feet and wept and craved her pardon, raised him,
               unworthy though he was, to his feet and generously forgave him,
               and tenderly embraced him as her husband. Ambrogiuolo the
               Soldan commanded to be bound to a stake, that his bare flesh,
               anointed with honey, might be exposed to the sun on one of the
               heights of the city, there to remain until it should fall to pieces
               of its own accord: and so 'twas done. He then decreed that the
               lady should have the traitor's estate, which was worth not less but
               rather more than ten thousand doubloons; whereto he added, in
               jewels and vessels of gold and silver and in money, the equivalent
               of upwards of other ten thousand doubloons, having first entertained
               her and her husband with most magnificent and ceremonious cheer,
               accordant with the lady's worth. Which done, he placed a ship at
               their disposal, and gave them leave to return to <span class="place">Genoa</span> at their
               pleasure. So to <span class="place">Genoa</span> they returned very rich and happy, and
               were received with all honour, especially Madam Zinevra, whom
               all the citizens had believed to be dead, and whom thenceforth, so
               long as she lived, they held of great consequence and excellency.
               As for Ambrogiuolo, the very same day that he was bound to the
               stake, the honey with which his body was anointed attracted such
               swarms of flies, wasps and gadflies, wherewith that country abounds,
               that not only was his life sucked from him but his very bones were
               completely denuded of flesh; in which state, hanging by the sinews,
               they remained a long time undisturbed, for a sign and a testimony
               of his baseness to all that passed by. And so the deceived had the
               better of the deceiver.

               asks him to restore her. He consents, provided she
               be willing. She refuses to go back with her husband.
               Messer Ricciardo dies, and she marries Paganino.

               <p>Their queen's story, by its beauty, elicited hearty commendation

                  with whom it now rested to conclude the day's narration. Again and
                  again he renewed his eulogy of the queen's story; and then began

               <p>Fair ladies, there is that in the queen's story which has caused
                  	me to change my purpose, and substitute another story for that
                  	which I had meant to tell: I refer to the insensate folly of
                  	Bernabò (well though it was with him in the end) and of all
                  	others, who delude themselves, as he seemed to do, with the vain
                  	imagination that, while they go about the world, taking their
                  	pleasure now of this, now of the other woman, their wives, left
                  	at home, suffer not their hands to stray from their girdles; as if
                  	we, who are born of them and bred among them, could be ignorant
                  	of the bent of their desires. Wherefore, by my story I purpose
                  	at one and the same time to shew you how great is the folly of
                  	all such, and how much greater is the folly of those who, deeming
                  	themselves mightier than nature, think by sophistical arguments to
                  	bring that to pass which is beyond their power, and strive might
                  	and main to conform others to their own pattern, however little
                  	the nature of the latter may brook such treatment.

            <p>Know then
               that there was in <span class="place">Pisa</span>a judge, better endowed with mental than
               with physical vigour, by name Messer Ricciardo di Chinzica, who,
               being minded to take a wife, and thinking, perhaps, to satisfy her
               by the same resources which served him for his studies, was to be
               suited with none that had not both youth and beauty, qualities
               which he would rather have eschewed, if he had known how to
               give himself as good counsel as he gave to others. However, being
               very rich, he had his desire. 
               Messer <span class="person">Lotto</span> Gualandi gave him in
               marriage one of his daughters, Bartolomea by name, a maid as fair
               and fit for amorous dalliance as any in <span class="place">Pisa</span>, though few maids be
               there that do not shew as spotted lizards. 
               The judge brought her
               home with all pomp and ceremony, and had a brave and lordly
               wedding; but in the essay which he made the very first night to
               serve her so as to consummate the marriage he made a false move,
               and drew the game much to his own disadvantage; for next morning
               his lean, withered and scarce animate frame was only to be
               re-quickened by draughts of vernaccia,A strong white wine.
               artificial restoratives and the
               like remedies. 
               So, taking a more sober estimate of his powers than
               he had been wont, the worthy judge began to give his wife lessons
               from a calendar, which might have served as a horn-book, and
               perhaps had been put together at <span class="place">Ravenna</span>:The saying went, that owing
               to the multitude of churches at <span class="place">Ravenna</span>
               every day was there a saint's day. 
               inasmuch as, according
               to his shewing, there was not a day in the year but was sacred,
               not to one saint only, but to many; in honour of whom for divers
               reasons it behoved men and women to abstain from carnal intercourse;
               whereto he added fast-days, Ember-days, vigils of Apostles
               and other saints, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, the whole of Lent,
               certain lunar mansions, and many other exceptions, arguing perchance,
               that the practice of men with women abed should have
               its times of vacation no less than the administration of the law.
               In this method, which caused the lady grievous dumps, he long
               persisted, hardly touching her once a month, and observing her
               closely, lest another should give her to know working-days, as he
               had taught her holidays.
            </p>
            <p>Now it so befell that, one hot season, Messer Ricciardo thought
               he would like to visit a very beautiful estate which he had near
               <span class="place">Monte Nero</span>, there to take the air and recreate himself for some
               days, and thither accordingly he went with his fair lady. 
               While
               there, to amuse her, he arranged for a day's fishing; and so, he in
               one boat with the fishermen, and she in another with other ladies,
               they put out to watch the sport, which they found so delightsome,
               that almost before they knew where they were they were some miles
               out to sea. And while they were thus engrossed with the sport, a
               galliot of Paganino da Mare, a very famous corsair of those days,
               hove in sight and bore down upon the boats, and, for all the speed
               they made, came up with that in which were the ladies; and on
               sight of the fair lady Paganino, regardless of all else, bore her off to
               his galliot before the very eyes of Messer Ricciardo, who was by this
               time ashore, and forthwith was gone. The chagrin of the judge,
               who was jealous of the very air, may readily be imagined. But
               'twas to no purpose that, both at <span class="place">Pisa</span>and elsewhere, he moaned and
               groaned over the wickedness of the corsairs, for he knew neither by
               whom his wife had been abducted, nor whither she had been taken.
               Paganino, meanwhile, deemed himself lucky to have gotten so
               beautiful a prize; and being unmarried, he was minded never to
               part with her, and addressed himself by soft words to soothe the
               sorrow which kept her in a flood of tears. Finding words of little
               avail, he at night passed--the more readily that the calendar had
               slipped from his girdle, and all feasts and holidays from his  mind--to
               acts of love, and on this wise administered consolation so effective
               that before they were come to <span class="place">Monaco</span> she had completely forgotten
               the judge and his canons, and had begun to live with Paganino as
               merrily as might be. So he brought her to <span class="place">Monaco</span>, where, besides
               the daily and nightly solace which he gave her, he honourably
               entreated her as his wife.
            </p>
            <p>Not long afterwards Messer Ricciardo coming to know where
               his wife was, and being most ardently desirous to have her back, and
               thinking none but he would understand exactly what to do in the
               circumstances, determined to go and fetch her himself, being prepared
               to spend any sum of money that might be demanded by way of
               ransom. So he took ship, and being come to <span class="place">Monaco</span>, he both saw
               her and was seen by her; which news she communicated to
               Paganino in the evening, and told him how she was minded to
               behave. Next morning Messer Ricciardo, encountering Paganino,
               made up to him; and soon assumed a very familiar and friendly air,
               while Paganino pretended not to know him, being on his guard to see
               what he would be at. So Messer Ricciardo, as soon as he deemed
               the time ripe, as best and most delicately he was able, disclosed to
               Paganino the business on which he had come, praying him to take
               whatever in the way of ransom he chose and restore him the lady.
               Paganino replied cheerily: Right glad I am to see you here, Sir;
               and briefly thus I answer you: True it is that I have here a young
               woman; whether she be your wife or another man's, I know not,
               for you are none of my acquaintance, nor is she, except for the short
               time that she has been with me. If, as you say, you are her husband,
               why, as you seem to me to be a pleasant gentleman, I will even take
               you to her, and I doubt not she will know you well; if she says that
               it is even as you say, and is minded to go with you, you shall give
               me just what you like by way of ransom, so pleasant have I found
               you; otherwise 'twill be churlish in you to think of taking her from
               me, who am a young man, and as fit to keep a woman as another,
               and moreover never knew any woman so agreeable. 
               My wife,
               said Ricciardo, she is beyond all manner of doubt, as thou shalt
               see; for so soon as thou bringest me to her, she will throw her arms
               about my neck; wherefore as thou art minded, even so be it; I ask
               no more. 
               Go we then, said Paganino; 
               and forthwith they
               went into the house, and Paganino sent for the lady while they
               waited in one of the halls. By and by she entered from one of the
               adjoining rooms all trim and tricked out, and advanced to the place
               where Paganino and Messer Ricciardo were standing, but never a
               word did she vouchsafe to her husband, any more than if he had been
               some stranger whom Paganino had brought into the house. Whereat
               the judge was mightily amazed, having expected to be greeted by
               her with the heartiest of cheer, and began to ruminate thus:
               Perhaps I am so changed by the melancholy and prolonged heartache,
               to which I have been a prey since I lost her, that she does not
               recognise me. 
               Wherefore he said: Madam, cause enough have
               I to rue it that I took thee a fishing, for never yet was known such
               grief as has been mine since I lost thee; and now it seems as if thou
               dost not recognise me, so scant of courtesy is thy greeting. Seest
               thou not that I am thy Messer Ricciardo, come hither prepared to
               pay whatever this gentleman, in whose house we are, may demand,
               that I may have thee back and take thee away with me: and he is
               so good as to surrender thee on my own terms? 
               The lady turned
               to him with a slight smile, and said: Is it to me you speak, Sir?
               Bethink you that you may have mistaken me for another, for I, for
               my part, do not remember ever to have seen you. 
               Nay, said
               Messer Ricciardo, but bethink thee what thou sayst; scan me
               closely; and if thou wilt but search thy memory, thou wilt find that
               I am thy Ricciardo di Chinzica. 
               Your pardon, Sir, answered
               the lady, 'tis not, perhaps, as seemly for me, as you imagine, to
               gaze long upon you; but I have gazed long enough to know that I
               never saw you before. 
               Messer Ricciardo supposed that she so spoke
               for fear of Paganino, in whose presence she durst not acknowledge
               that she knew him: so, after a while, he craved as a favour of
               Paganino that he might speak with her in a room alone. 
               Which
               request Paganino granted, so only that he did not kiss her against her
               will. He then bade the lady go with Messer Ricciardo into a room
               apart, and hear what he had to say, and give him such answer as she
               deemed meet. So the lady and Messer Ricciardo went together into
               a room alone, and sate down, and Messer Ricciardo began on this
               wise: Ah! dear heart of me, sweet soul of me, hope of me, dost
               not recognise thy Ricciardo that loves thee better than himself?
               how comes it thus to pass? am I then so changed? Ah! goodly
               eye of me, do but look on me a little. 
               Whereat the lady burst into
               a laught, and interrupting him, said: Rest assured that my memory
               is not so short but that I know you for what you are, my husband,
               Messer Ricciardo di Chinzica; but far enough you shewed yourself
               to be, while I was with you, from knowing me for what I was,
               young, lusty, lively; which, had you been the wise man you would
               fain be reputed, you would not have ignored, nor by consequence
               that which, besides food and clothing, it behoves men to give young
               ladies, albeit for shame they demand it not; which in what sort you
               gave, you know. You should not have taken a wife if she was to
               be less to you than the study of the law, albeit 'twas never as a judge
               that I regarded you, but rather as a bellman of encænia and saints'
               days, so well you knew them all, and fasts and vigils. And I tell
               you that, had you imposed the observance of as many saints' days on
               the labourers that till your lands as on yourself who had but my little
               plot to till, you would never have harvested a single grain of corn.
               God in His mercy, having regard unto my youth, has caused me to
               fall in with this gentleman, with whom I am much closeted in this
               room, where nought is known of feasts, such feasts, I mean, as you,
               more devoted to the service of God than to the service of ladies, were
               wont to observe in such profusion; nor was this threshold ever
               crossed by Saturday or Friday or vigil or Ember-days or Lent, that
               is so long; rather here we are at work day and night, threshing the
               wool, and well I know how featly it went when the matin bell last
               sounded. Wherefore with him I mean to stay, and to work while
               I am young, and postpone the observance of feasts and times of
               indulgence and fasts until I am old: so get you hence, and good luck
               go with you, but depart with what speed you may, and observe as
               many feasts as you like, so I be not with you.
            </p>
            <p>The pain with which Messer Ricciardo followed this outburst
               was more than he could bear, and when she had done, he exclaimed:
               Ah! sweet soul of me, what words are these that thou
               utterest? Hast thou no care for thy parents' honour and thine
               own? Wilt thou remain here to be this man's harlot, and to live
               in mortal sin, rather than live with me at <span class="place">Pisa</span>as my wife? Why,
               when he is tired of thee, he will cast thee out to thy most grievous
               dishonour. I will ever cherish thee, and ever, will I nill I, thou
               wilt be the mistress of my house. Wouldst thou, to gratify this
               unbridled and unseemly passion, part at once with thy honour and
               with me, who love thee more dearly than my very life? Ah!
               cherished hope of me, say not so again: make up thy mind to come
               with me. As I now know thy bent, I will henceforth constrain
               myself to pleasure thee: wherefore, sweet my treasure, think better
               of it, and come with me, who have never known a happy hour since
               thou wert reft from me. 
               The lady answered: I expect not, nor
               is it possible, that another should be more tender of my honour than
               I am myself. Were my parents so, when they gave me to you? I
               trow not; nor mean I to be more tender of their honour now than
               they were then of mine. And if now I live in mortar sin, I will
               ever abide there until it be pestle sin:A poor jeu de mots, mortaio,
               mortar, being substituted for mortale. concern yourself no further
               on my account. 
               Moreover, let me tell you, that, whereas at <span class="place">Pisa</span> 'twas as if I were your harlot, seeing that the planets in conjunction
               according to lunar mansion and geometric square intervened between
               you and me, here with Paganino I deem myself a wife, for he holds
               me in his arms all night long and hugs and bites me, and how he
               serves me, God be my witness. 
               Ah! but you say you will constrain
               yourself to serve me: to what end? to do it on the third essay,
               and raise it by stroke of bâton? I doubt not you are become a
               perfect knight since last I saw you. Begone, and constrain yourself
               to live; for here, methinks, your tenure is but precarious, so hectic
               and wasted is your appearance. Nay more; I tell you this, that,
               should Paganino desert me (which he does not seem disposed to do
               so long as I am willing to stay with him), never will I return to
               your house, where for one while I staid to my most grievous loss
               and prejudice, but will seek my commodity elsewhere, than with
               one from whose whole body I could not wring a single cupful of sap.
               So, again, I tell you that here is neither feast nor vigil; wherefore
               here I mean to abide; and you, get you gone, in God's name with
               what speed you may, lest I raise the cry that you threaten to
               violate me.
            </p>
            <p>Messer Ricciardo felt himself hard bested, but he could not but
               recognise that, worn out as he was, he had been foolish to take a
               young wife; so sad and woebegone he quitted the room, and, after
               expending on Paganino a wealth of words which signified nothing,
               he at last gave up his bootless enterprise, and leaving the lady to her
               own devices, returned to <span class="place">Pisa</span>; where for very grief he lapsed into
               such utter imbecility that, when he was met by any with greeting or
               question in the street, he made no other answer than the evil hole
               brooks no holiday, and soon afterwards died. Which when Paganino
               learned, being well assured of the love the lady bore him, he made
               her his lawful wife; and so, keeping neither feast nor vigil nor Lent,
               they worked as hard as their legs permitted, and had a good time.
               Wherefore, dear my ladies, I am of opinion that Messer Bernabò in
               his altercation with Ambrogiuolo rode the goat downhill.I. e.
               argued preposterously, the goat being the last animal to carry a
               rider comfortably downhill.

            <h3 class="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
            <p>This story provoked so much laughter that the jaws of every one
               in the company ached; and all the ladies by common consent
               acknowledged that <span class="person">Dioneo</span> was right, and pronounced Bernabò a
               blockhead. But when the story was ended and the laughter had
               subsided, the queen, observing that the hour was now late, and that
               with the completion of the day's story-telling the end of her
               sovereignty was come, followed the example of her predecessor, and
               took off her wreath and set it on <span class="person">Neifile</span>'s brow, saying with gladsome
               mien, Now, dear gossip, thine be the sovereignty of this little
               	people; and so she resumed her seat. <span class="person">Neifile</span> coloured somewhat
               to receive such honour, shewing of aspect even as the fresh-blown
               rose of April or May in the radiance of the dawn, her eyes rather
               downcast, and glowing with love's fire like the morning-star. But
               when the respectful murmur, by which the rest of the company gave
               blithe token of the favour in which they held their queen, was
               hushed, and her courage revived, she raised herself somewhat more
               in her seat than she was wont, and thus spoke: 
               As so it is that
               I am your queen, I purpose not to depart from the usage observed
               by my predecessors, whose rule has commanded not only your
               obedience but your approbation. I will therefore in few words
               explain to you the course which, if it commend itself to your
               wisdom, we will follow. To-morrow, you know, is Friday, and the
               next day Saturday, days which most folk find somewhat wearisome
               by reason of the viands which are then customary, to say nothing of
               the reverence in which Friday is meet to be held, seeing that 'twas
               on that day that He who died for us bore His passion; wherefore
               'twould be in my judgment both right and very seemly, if, in honour
               of God, we then bade story-telling give place to prayer. 
               On
               Saturday ladies are wont to wash the head, and rid their persons of
               whatever of dust or other soilure they may have gathered by the
               labours of the past week; not a few, likewise, are wont to practise
               abstinence for devotion to the Virgin Mother of the Son of God,
               and to honour the approaching Sunday by an entire surcease from
               work. Wherefore, as we cannot then completely carry out our
               plan of life, we shall, I think, do well to intermit our story-telling
               on that day also. We shall then have been here four days; and
               lest we should be surprised by new-comers, I deem it expedient that
               we shift our quarters, and I have already taken thought for our next
               place of sojourn. Where, being arrived on Sunday, we will assemble
               after our sleep; and, whereas to-day our discourse has had an ample
               field to range in, I propose, both because you will thereby have more
               time for thought, and it will be best to set some limits to the license
               of our story-telling, that of the many diversities of Fortune's handiwork
               we make one our theme, whereof I have also made choice, 
               to
               wit, the luck of such as have painfully acquired some much-coveted
               thing, or having lost, have recovered it. Whereon let each meditate
               some matter, which to tell may be profitable or at least delectable to
               the company, saving always <span class="person">Dioneo</span>'s privilege.
            </p>
            <p>All applauded the queen's speech and plan, to which, therefore,
               it was decided to give effect. Thereupon the queen called her
               seneschal, told him where to place the tables that evening, and then
               explained to him all that he had to do during the time of her
               sovereignty. This done, she rose with her train, and gave leave to
               all to take their pleasure as to each might seem best. 
               So the ladies
               and the men hied them away to a little garden, where they diverted
               themselves a while; then supper-time being come, they supped with
               all gay and festal cheer. When they were risen from the table,
               <span class="person">Emilia</span>, at the queen's command, led the dance, while <span class="person">Pampinea</span>,
               the other ladies responding, sang the ensuing song.
            </p>
            <div class="song">
               	Shall any lady sing, if I not sing,
               	I to whom Love did full contentment bring?
               
               	Come hither, Love, thou cause of all my joy,
               	Of all my hope, and all its sequel blest,
               	And with me tune the lay,
               	No more to sighs and bitter past annoy,
               	That now but serve to lend thy bliss more zest;
               	But to that fire's clear ray,
               	Wherewith enwrapt I blithely live and gay,
               	Thee as my God for ever worshipping.
               
               	'Twas thou, O Love, didst set before mine eyes,
               	When first thy fire my sould did penetrate,
               	A youth to be my fere,
               	So fair, so fit for deeds of high emprise,
               	That ne'er another shall be found more great,
               	Nay, nor, I ween, his peer:
               	Such flame he kindled that my heart's full cheer
               	I now pour out in chant with thee, my King.
               
               	And that wherein I most delight is this,
               	That as I love him, so he loveth me:
               	So thank thee, Love, I must.
               	For whatsoe'er this world can yield of bliss
               	Is mine, and in the next at peace to be
               	I hope through that full trust
               	I place in him. And thou, O God, that dost
               	It see, wilt grant of joy thy plenishing.
               
            </div>
            <p>Some other songs and dances followed, to the accompaniment
               of divers sorts of music; after which, the queen deeming it time to
               go to rest, all, following in the wake of the torches, sought their
               several chambers. The next two days they devoted to the duties
               to which the queen had adverted, looking forward to the Sunday
               with eager expectancy.
