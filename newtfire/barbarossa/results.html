        <h2>What is the correlation between casualties and victory on the Eastern Front?</h2>

        <h3>Answer: Little to nothing.</h3>
        <p>The numbers associated with our site are undeniable important, as they emphasize the
            scale of these battles and amount of human life that was lost during Operation
            Barbarossa, but truthfully, casualties are not a relevant factor in determining the
            victor during a given battle</p>
        <p>The reason why is because the two sides simply followed a different military doctrine,
            where the Germans put an emphasis on smaller amount of better equipment and better
            trained troops, the Soviet Union adopted the idea of Human Wave tactics. What Germany
            did would not have worked in the Soviet Union, and vice versa. The Soviet Union, as we
            know now, won the war, and they overwhelmingly took more casualties than Germany, and
            every other nation during World War 2. </p>
        <h2>In Conclusion, casualties don&apos;t tell the whole story.</h2>
