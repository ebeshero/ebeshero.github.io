        <h2>Involved in the <a href="leningrad.html">Siege of Leningrad</a></h2>
        <p>von Leeb was born in Bavaria in 1876. Ritter von Leebworked his way through the German
            Army through World War One much like other high ranking German officers at the time.
            Adolf Hitler did not like Ritter von Leeb because he expressed anti-Nazi attitudes and
            had him retire in 1938. He was called back to service by Hitler twice during his
            “retirement” and Ritter von Leeb accepted the offers and helped lead the German Army in
            the Sudetenland and then again in France. </p>
        <p>He was trusted by <a href="hitler.html">Hitler</a> and assigned to lead German troops in
            Operation Barbarossa and to <a href="leningrad.html">capture Leningrad</a>. After making
            great pace through the Soviet Union, he was unable to capture Leningrad in the quickness
            that Hitler wanted and stepped down from his position. Ritter von Leeb never worked
            under Hitler again and was now retired from the German Army for good. He was tried at
            Nuremberg and sentenced to three years in prison but was later released early. He died
            in 1956 after a heart attack. </p>
