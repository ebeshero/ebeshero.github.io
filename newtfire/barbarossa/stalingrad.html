                <h2>The Battle:</h2>
                <p>The Battle of Stalingrad was the successful Soviet defense of the city of
                    Stalingrad (now Volgograd), Russia, U.S.S.R., during World War II. Russians
                    consider it to be one of the greatest battles of their Great Patriotic War, and
                    most historians consider it to be the greatest battle of the entire conflict. It
                    stopped the German advance into the Soviet Union and marked the turning of the
                    tide of war in favour of the Allies. </p>

                <p>With fewer than 20,000 troops in the city and less than 100 tanks, <a
                        href="leaders.html">Stalin&apos;s generals</a> finally began sending
                    reinforcements into the city and surrounding areas. Fighting raged in the
                    streets of Stalingrad, with both sides using snipers poised on the roofs of the
                    city&apos;s buildings.</p>
                <p>Although they again sustained significant losses, Russian forces were able to
                    form what in essence was a defensive ring around the city by late November 1942,
                    trapping the nearly 300,000 German and Axis troops in the 6th Army. This effort
                    became the subject of a propaganda film produced after the war, The Battle of
                    Stalingrad.</p>

                <p>By February 1943, Russian troops had retaken Stalingrad and captured nearly
                    100,000 German soldiers, though pockets of resistance continued to fight in the
                    city until early March. Most of the captured soldiers died in Russian prison
                    camps, either as a result of disease or starvation. </p>
