                <h2>The Battle:</h2>
                <p>At the end of October 1941, the condition of the German Army in the Soviet Union
                    was grim. The 101 infantry divisions in the East had a fighting strength
                    equivalent to 65 divisions at full strength, while the 17 panzer divisions had
                    been reduced to a fighting strength of the equivalent of six at full strength.
                    Guderian, who had earlier been so enthusiastic about attacking Moscow, argued
                    that his <q>army</q> was incapable of achieving its objectives. One of his panzer
                    corps, for example, had only 50 tanks left out of a full establishment of 600. </p>

                <p>The onset of the cold weather in November brought even greater hardship to the
                    troops. Guderian again: "The icy cold, the lack of shelter, the shortage of
                    clothing, the heavy losses of men and equipment, the wretched state of our fuel
                    supplies, all this makes the duties of a commander a misery, and the longer it
                    goes on the more I am crushed by the responsibility I have to bear."By December,
                    the Russians had started to counter-attack the Germans. In just 20 days of the
                    second offensive, the Germans lost 155,000 men (killed, wounded or a victim of
                    frostbite), about 800 tanks and 300 artillery guns. The failure of German forces
                    at Moscow doomed Germany to fighting a prolonged struggle on the Eastern Front.
                    This part of the war would consume the vast majority of Germany's manpower and
                    resources for the remainder of the conflict.</p>
