                <h2>The Battle:</h2>
                <p>It was one of the greatest stages of Operation Barbarossa with attacks,
                    resistance, and counterattacks all failing. The German Army moved quickly
                    towards Kiev and tried to capture the city. It would be remembered as the
                    greatest encirclement in the history of warfare.Hitler wanted to deprive the
                    Soviets of their resources and factories, so he put in place Directive 33 on
                    July 19, 1941. The world was holding its breath to see who would be the victor
                    in this vicious battle between two superpowers.The German generals were against
                    Hitler&#146;s directives. They were of the opinion that Moscow had to be
                    captured first. But Hitler had other ideas in mind.</p>

                <p>Kiev had effectively fallen by September 19, but the encircled troops continued
                    to put up a fight. The Red Army&#146;s 5th, 26th, 21st, 38th, and 37th Army were
                    captured inside the circle. They fought for about ten more days, but everything
                    was falling apart.It&#146;s possible that this battle subtly impacted on the
                    course of the war. If Hitler had not rejected the advice of all his generals and
                    had proceeded to take Moscow instead, maybe history would have been different.
                    The Germans might have won this battle, but their delay in taking Moscow was
                    fatal.</p>
