        <p>Joseph Stalin was born in 1878 in a state of poverty in Georgia, which was part of the
            Russian Empire. He had originally gone on to study and enter the priesthood of the
            Georgian Orthodox Church. It was during this time that he began to read the “Communist
            Manifesto” by Karl Marx. After being expelled from the seminary, Stalin took up
            politics.</p>

        <p>Stalin worked his way through the Communist Party in the Soviet Union under Lenin and
            after the death of Lenin, Stalin was able to gain power and become the dictator of the
            Soviet Union. During his time as dictator he ruled ruthlessly. He transformed the Soviet
            Union into an industrial empire and away from an agrarian society. He killed and
            tortured those who opposed him which led to his long tenure as dictator. He was the
            leader of the Soviet Union which opposed Hitler during World War Two and was an ally of
            the United States despite their use of Communism. Stalin was the leader until he died in
            1953 from a stroke.</p>
