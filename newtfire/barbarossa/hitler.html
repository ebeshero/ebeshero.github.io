        <p>Adolf Hitler was born in Austria in 1889. He had intended to pursue a career in Art but
            was later rejected by art and architecture schools in Vienna at the age of 18. Several
            years later during the First World War, he volunteered to fight for Germany where he was
            injured in a mustard gas attack. Hitler would go onto live in a state of depression and
            uncertainness for a couple ofyears followingthe war.</p>

                <p>By 1921 Adolf Hitler had become the leader of the National Socialist German Workers’
            Party, also known as the Nazi party. Hitler was later tried for treason and was given a
            light sentence in prison. By the time he had gotten out of prison, the world was in a
            deep depression which gave way to his Nazi party to become popular among German
            citizens. In 1939 Hitler’s Nazi Germany invaded Poland and France and turnedtheir sights
            to the east in Operation Barbarossa to invade the Soviet Union. Barbarossa was a failure
            by 1943 and the German troops began their retreat. By 1945 the war was all but lost and
            Hitler committed suicide to avoid being captured by allied soldiers. </p>
