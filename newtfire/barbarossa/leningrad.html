                <h2>The Battle:</h2>
                <p>German forces begin their siege of Leningrad, a major industrial center and the
                    USSR&apos;s second-largest city.Leningrad, formerly St. Petersburg, capital of
                    the Russian Empire, was one of the initial targets of the German invasion of
                    June 1941. As German armies raced across the western Soviet Union,
                    three-quarters of Leningrad&apos;s industrial plants and hundreds of thousands
                    of its inhabitants were evacuated to the east. </p>

                <p>German artillery and air bombardments came several times a day during the first
                    months of the siege. The daily ration for civilians was reduced to 125 grams of
                    bread, no more than a thick slice. Starvation set in by December, followed by
                    the coldest winter in decades, with temperatures falling to -40 degrees
                    Fahrenheit. People worked through the winter in makeshift armament factories
                    without roofs, building the weapons that kept the Germans just short of
                    victory.</p>

                <p>In early 1944, Soviet forces approached Leningrad, forcing German forces to
                    retreat southward from the city on January 27. The siege was over. A giant
                    Soviet offensive to sweep the USSR clean of its invaders began in May. The
                    872-day siege of Leningrad cost an estimated one million Soviet lives, perhaps
                    hundreds of thousands more. The Soviet government awarded the Order of Lenin to
                    the people of Leningrad in 1945, paying tribute to their endurance during the
                    grueling siege. The city did not regain its prewar population of three million
                    until the 1960s. </p>
