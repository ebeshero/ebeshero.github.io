        <h2>Involved in the <a href="leningrad.html">Siege of Leningrad</a>, <a href="moscow.html">Siege of Moscow</a>, and the <a href="stalingrad.html">Battle of Stalingrad</a></h2>
        <p>Georgy Zhukov was born in 1896 in a peasant family near Moscow. He entered the military
            in 1915 and rose through the ranks and was sent to fight the Japanese in 1939. Joseph
            Stalin later appointed him Chief of the Army General Staff and was assigned to the
            defense of Moscow from the Germans. He was later sent to the southwestern front where he
            and Vasilevsky were successful in the <a href="stalingrad.html">surrender of the German sixth army</a>. He led the
            Soviets todefeating the Germans at Kursk which ended up being a turning point for the
            Soviets in the war. </p>
        <p>Zhukov led the Soviets in the assault and capture of Berlin which led him to become a
            famous figure not just in the Soviet Union, but around the world. Because of this
            success and popularity, <a href="stalin.html">Stalin</a> took Zhukov as a threat and demoted him. He was never
            able to fully hang on to a decentmilitaryjob again after this demotion. Georgy Zhukov
            died in 1974. </p>
