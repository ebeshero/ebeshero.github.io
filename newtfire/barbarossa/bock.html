        <h2>Involved in the <a href="moscow.html">Siege of Moscow</a></h2>
        <p>Fedor von Bock was born in Germany in 1880 and became a decorated German veteran in the
            First World War. One of the few high ranking officers in theGerman Army to survive the
            Hitler purge in 1933, von Bock was the leader of the troops that went in to take the
            Sudetenland in 1939. Von Bock lead troops through Europe and gained the respect from
            Hitler and was given <a href="moscow.html">the task of capturing Moscow</a> in Operation Barbarossa.</p>
        <p>Fedor von Bock led German soldiers through Russia in the summer and was just shy of
            Moscow when Hitler decided to pull troops away from the attack on Moscow which led von
            Bock with the option of having to wait it out in the brutal Russian winter. Hitler
            ignored the weather factor and put the sole blame on Fedor von Bock for not taking
            Moscow and Hitler had him replaced. Von Bock retired from the German Army in 1942. He
            opposed Nazism the entire time of his service but in order to maintain his career, he
            kept quiet throughout the years of Hitler. </p>
