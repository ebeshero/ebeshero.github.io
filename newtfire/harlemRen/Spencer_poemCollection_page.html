            Mechanics of this unlovely thing<span class="comma">,</span>
         <br/>
            Are darling of spirit and form<span class="period">.</span>

            Sits-by-the-fire in my heart<span class="period">.</span>
         <br/>
            My Limousine-Lady knows you<span class="comma">,</span> or<br/>
            Why does the slant-envy of her eye mark<br/>
            Your straight air and radiant inclusive smile<span class="question_mark">?</span>

            Guilt pins a fig-leaf<span class="semicolon">;</span> Innocence is its own adorning<span class="period">.</span>

            In the presence of a blind crowd<br/>
            The color of life was gray<span class="period">.</span>

            Here the sausage and garlic booth<br/>
            Sent unholy incense skyward<span class="semicolon">;</span>
         <br/>
            There a quivering female-thing<br/>
            Gestured assignations<span class="comma">,</span> and lied<br/>
            To call it dancing<span class="semicolon">;</span>
         <br/>
            There<span class="comma">,</span> too, were games of chance<br/>

         <br/>
            But oh! Girl-of-the-Tank<span class="comma">,</span> at last<span class="exclamation_point">!</span><br/>
            Gleaming Girl<span class="comma">,</span> how intimately pure and free<br/>

            You saved me your hob and hearth—<br/>

            But I can wait the seven of moons<span class="comma">,</span>

            Or years I spare<span class="comma">,</span>
         <br/>
            it's plenty<span class="comma">,</span> nor spend<br/>
            A drop<span class="comma">,</span> nor share—<br/>
            So long but outlives a smile and<br/>
            A silken gown<span class="semicolon">;</span>
         <br/>
            Then gaily I reach up from my shroud<span class="comma">,</span>

      <h2>Translation </h2>
      <p>
            We trekked into a far country<span class="comma">,</span>

            But each knew all the other said<span class="period">.</span>

            He told me how calm his soul was laid<br/>

            “The wooing kestrel<span class="comma">,</span>” I said<span class="comma">,</span> “mutes his mating-note<br/>

            And when at the day’s end<br/>
            We laid tired bodies ’gainst<br/>
            The loose warm sands<span class="comma">,</span>
         <br/>
            And the air fleeced its particles for a coverlet<span class="semicolon">;</span>

            When star after star came out<br/>

            A bird<span class="comma">,</span> next<span class="comma">,</span> small and humming,<br/>
