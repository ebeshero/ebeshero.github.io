            Heart of what slave poured out such melody<br/>
            As "Steal away to Jesus"<span class="question_mark">?</span> On its strains<br/>
            His spirit must have nightly floated free<span class="comma">,</span>

            These songs of sorrow<span class="comma">,</span> love and faith<span class="comma">,</span> and hope?<br/>
            How did it catch that subtle undertone<span class="comma">,</span>

            That note in music heard not with the ears<span class="question_mark">?</span>

            How sound the elusive reed so seldom blown<span class="comma">,</span>

      <h2>The Awakening</h2>
      <p>
            I dreamed that I was a rose<br/>

            Close by a path none ever chose<span class="comma"/>

            I grew and waited there apart<span class="comma">,</span>

            Gathering perfume hour by hour<span class="comma">,</span>

      <h2>The Creation</h2>
      <p>
            And God stepped out on space<span class="comma">,</span>
         <br/>
            And he looked around and said<span class="colon">:</span>

            I am lonely<span class="dash">--</span>

            And far as the eye of God could see<br/>
            Darkness covered everything<span class="comma">,</span>

            <span class="simile">Blacker than a hundred midnights</span>

            Down in a cypress swamp<span class="period">.</span>

        <br/>
            Then God smiled<span class="comma">,</span>

            And the light broke<span class="comma">,</span>
         <br/>
            And the darkness rolled up on one side<span class="comma">,</span>
         <br/>
            And the light stood shining on the other<span class="comma">,</span>

            Then God reached out and took the light in his hands<span class="comma">,</span>

            And God rolled the light around in his hands<br/>
            Until he made the sun<span class="semicolon">;</span>

            And he set that sun a-blazing in the heavens<span class="period">.</span>
         <br/>
            And the light that was left from making the sun<br/>
            God gathered it up in a shining ball<br/>
            And flung it against the darkness<span class="comma">,</span>
         <br/>
            Spangling the night with the moon and stars<span class="period">.</span>
         <br/>
            Then down between<br/>
            The darkness and the light<br/>
            He hurled the world<span class="semicolon">;</span>
         <br/>
            And God said<span class="colon">:</span> That is good<span class="exclamation_point">!</span>

        <br/>
            Then God himself stepped down<span class="dash">-</span>
         <br/>
            And the sun was on his right hand<span class="comma">,</span>
         <br/>
            And the moon was on his left<span class="semicolon">;</span>
         <br/>
            The stars were clustered about his head<span class="comma">,</span>
         <br/>
            And the earth was under his feet<span class="period">.</span>
         <br/>
            And God walked<span class="comma">,</span> and where he trod<br/>
            His footsteps hollowed the valleys out<br/>

        <br/>
            Then he stopped and looked and saw<br/>
            That the earth was hot and barren<span class="period">.</span>

            So God stepped over to the edge of the world<br/>
            And he spat out the seven seas<span class="dash">-</span>

            He batted his eyes<span class="comma">,</span> and the lightnings flashed<span class="dash">-</span>

            He clapped his hands<span class="comma">,</span> and the thunders rolled<span class="dash">-</span>

            The lakes cuddled down in the hollows of the ground<span class="comma">,</span>
         <br/>
            And the rivers ran down to the sea<span class="semicolon">;</span>
         <br/>
            And God smiled again<span class="comma">,</span>

            Then God raised his arm and he waved his hand<br/>
            Over the sea and over the land<span class="comma">,</span>

            And he said<span class="colon">:</span> Bring forth<span class="exclamation_point">!</span> Bring forth<span class="exclamation_point">!</span>

            And quicker than God could drop his hand<span class="comma">,</span>
         <br/>
            Fishes and fowls<br/>
            And beasts and birds<br/>
            Swam the rivers and the seas<span class="comma">,</span>

            Roamed the forests and the woods<span class="comma">,</span>

            Then God walked around<span class="comma">,</span>

            He looked at his sun<span class="comma">,</span>

        <br/>
            Then God sat down<span class="dash">-</span>

            Up from the bed of the river<br/>
            God scooped the clay<span class="semicolon">;</span>

      <h2>The White Witch</h2>
      <p>
            O brothers mine, take care! Take care<span class="exclamation_point">!</span>
         <br/>
            The great white witch rides out to-night<span class="period">.</span>
         <br/>
            Trust not your prowess nor your strength<span class="comma">,</span>
         <br/>
            Your only safety lies in flight<span class="semicolon">;</span>
         <br/>
            For in her glance there is a snare<span class="comma">,</span>
         <br/>
            And in her smile there is a blight<span class="period">.</span>
         <br/>
        <br/>
            The great white witch you have not seen<span class="question_mark">?</span>
         <br/>
            Then<span class="comma">,</span> younger brothers mine<span class="comma">,</span> forsooth<span class="comma">,</span>
         <br/>
            Like nursery children you have looked<br/>
            For ancient hag and snaggle-tooth<span class="semicolon">;</span>
         <br/>
            But no<span class="comma">,</span> not so<span class="semicolon">;</span> the witch appears<br/>
            In all the glowing charms of youth. <br/>
        <br/>
            <span class="simile">Her lips are like carnations</span>
         <span class="comma">,</span> red<span class="comma">,</span>
         <br/>
            <span class="simile">Her face like new-born lilies</span>
         <span class="comma">,</span> fair<span class="comma">,</span>
         <br/>
            <span class="simile">Her eyes like ocean waters</span>
         <span class="comma">,</span> blue<span class="comma">,</span>
         <br/>
            She moves with subtle grace and air<span class="comma">,</span>
         <br/>
            And all about her head there floats<br/>
            <span class="metaphor">The golden glory of her hair</span>
         <span class="period">.</span> 
         <br/>
        <br/>
            But though she always thus appears<br/>
            In form of youth and mood of mirth<span class="comma">,</span>
         <br/>
            Unnumbered centuries are hers<span class="comma">,</span>
         <br/>
            <span class="personification">The infant planets saw her birth</span>
         <span class="semicolon">;</span>
         <br/>
            The child of throbbing Life is she<span class="comma">,</span>
         <br/>
            Twin sister to the greedy earth<span class="period">.</span>
         <br/>
        <br/>
            And back behind those smiling lips<span class="comma">,</span>
         <br/>
            And down within those laughing eyes<span class="comma">,</span>
         <br/>
            And underneath the soft caress<br/>
            Of hand and voice and purring sighs<span class="comma">,</span>
         <br/>
            The shadow of the panther lurks<span class="comma">,</span>
         <br/>
            The spirit of the vampire lies<span class="period">.</span>
         <br/>
        <br/>
            For I have seen the great white witch<span class="comma">,</span>
         <br/>
            And she has led me to her lair<span class="comma">,</span>
         <br/>
            And I have kissed her red<span class="comma">,</span> red lips<br/>
            And cruel face so white and fair<span class="semicolon">;</span>
         <br/>
            Around me she has twined her arms<span class="comma">,</span>
         <br/>
            And bound me with her yellow hair<span class="period">.</span>
         <br/>
        <br/>
            I felt those red lips burn and sear<br/>
            My body like a living coal<span class="semicolon">;</span>
         <br/>
            Obeyed the power of those eyes<br/>
            <span class="personification">As the needle trembles to the pole</span>
         <span class="semicolon">;</span>
         <br/>
            And did not care although I felt<br/>
            The strength go ebbing from my soul<span class="period">.</span>
         <br/>
        <br/>
            Oh<span class="exclamation_point">!</span> she has seen your strong young limbs<span class="comma"/>
         <br/>
            And heard your laughter loud and gay<span class="comma">,</span>
         <br/>
            And in your voices she has caught<br/>
            The echo of a far-off day<span class="comma">,</span>
         <br/>
            When man was closer to the earth<span class="semicolon">;</span>
         <br/>
            And she has marked you for her prey <span class="period">.</span>
         <br/>
        <br/>
            She feels the old Antaean strength<br/>
            In you<span class="comma">,</span> the great dynamic beat<br/>
            Of primal passions<span class="comma">,</span> and she sees<br/>
            In you the last besieged retreat<br/>
            Of love relentless<span class="comma">,</span> lusty<span class="comma">,</span> fierce<span class="comma">,</span>
         <br/>
            Love pain-ecstatic<span class="comma">,</span> cruel-sweet<span class="period"/>. <br/>
        <br/>
            O<span class="comma">,</span> brothers mine<span class="comma">,</span> take care<span class="exclamation_point">!</span> Take care<span class="exclamation_point">!</span>
         <br/>
            The great white witch rides out to<span class="dash">-</span>night.<br/>
            O<span class="comma">,</span> younger brothers mine<span class="comma">,</span> beware<span class="exclamation_point">!</span>
         <br/>
            Look not upon her beauty bright<span class="semicolon">;</span>
         <br/>
            For in her glance there is a snare<span class="comma">,</span>
         <br/>
            And in her smile there is a blight<span class="period">.</span>
