        <h1>Welcome!</h1>
        <p>This webpage is dedicated to the Harlem Renaissance Poetry Project! On this site, you'll find biographical information about Harlem Renaissance poets 
        that our project team finds interesting and influential, as well as poems written by these poets during this important time period in African American history!</p>
        <p>This project was developed for the Digital Humanities Coding and Digital Archives class at the University of Pittsburgh at Greensburg.</p>
      
        <h2>Our Research Question</h2>
        <p>During the Harlem Renaissance, a time of cultural revolution in African American history, how did black poets write, both individually and 
        collectively? What do their writing styles tell us about the new freedom that the Harlem Renaissance gave to African American writers, as well as 
        the African American community as a whole?</p>

          <h3>Key Poem Elements for Analysis:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Punctuation ~ Which puncuation marks are used most often among these poets?</li>
                <li>Figurative Language ~ Does the poet use any figurative language? If so, what forms of figurative language are most common?</li>
            </ul>
          <p>We hope that, by looking at a cluster of individual poems by Harlem Renaissance poets, we can generalize our findings and discover patterns and trends for this time period.</p>
