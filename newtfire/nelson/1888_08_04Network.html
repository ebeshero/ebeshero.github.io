                    <p class="keyDesc">In this visualization, the size of the node is dependent on
                        the out-degree, or the number of nouns that word possessed. The larger the
                        node, the more nouns the word possessed. This is a directional network,
                        meaning that certain words own others; this is represented with arrows along
                        the lines connecting the nodes. The color of the node is dependent on the
                        in-degree, or the number of words by which the node was possessed. The more
                        light blue a node is, the more it is being possessed by other words. The
                        shape of the node determines if the node ever possesses another node:
                        diamond nodes possess other nodes, and circle nodes never possess other
                        nodes. The color of the border is dependent on different factors:
                        black-border nodes are never owned, red-border nodes are site-index nouns or
                        attributes that are directly possessed, orange-border nodes are site-index
                        nouns or archetypes that are indirectly possessed, and yellow-border nodes
                        never possess other nodes. The edge color is dependent on the article in
                        which a link between nodes was first made and each article has a different
                        color associated with it <small>(Click <a
