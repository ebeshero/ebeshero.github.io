                    <p><strong>Disclaimer: the analysis represented on this page fluctuates as
                            additional articles of the series are added to the pool of data used in
                            the creation of the graphs/networks.</strong></p>
                    <p>One of the first questions we posed after reading the series was: what gender
                        did Nelson incorporate the most dialogue from throughout the series?
                        Nelson's obvious focus in writing the articles is the "City Slave Girl"; so,
                        did Nelson choose to expose the plight of working-class women by giving them
                        a direct voice? The first time we ran the code over just a few beginning
                        articles we found that the female voice was significantly more represented
                        than the male voice. However, as transcriptions of articles from later in
                        the series have been added we start to see a more even distribution of
                        dialogue. We expect once all of the articles are transcribed and
                        incorporated into the data that the female voice will prevail. However, even
                        in the current state, with the male and female percentage of spoken text
                        being almost equal, we can see that Nelson's series and approach in writing
                        these articles provided a significant voice to people in the 19th century
                        who otherwise were marginalized by the patriarchal society: women!</p>

            </div>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-12 svgText">
                    <p>Next, we wanted to see how the dialogue was distributed among the different
                        types of people represented in the series. Nelson spoke with many different
                        groups of people in her expos√© for which we created an archetype identifier
                        for each categorization. Thus far, we have found that the working girl has
                        the greatest amount of dialogue. This corresponds with our theory that
                        Nelson provided a genuine voice for the main subjects of her series by
                        giving the "City Slave Girls" the most time to speak. Interestingly, even
                        when compared with Nelson's own dialogue, the working girl is represented
                        twice as much as the author.
                        <!--Furthermore, the voice of the employee when considered with the voice of the
                        working girl, is over 50% of total dialogue; therefore, it is significantly
                        more represented than that of the employer even when including the
                        foreperson.--></p>

                                    speakers in relation to their employment. The working girl,
                                    because of the focus of the series, received her own archetype.
                                    Employers were marked as owners of establishments (including
                                    familial ties). When an employee was recognized as a foreperson
                                    or someone with rank over other employees they were marked
                                    foreperson. An employee was any person employed by an
                                    establishment that could not be catergorized as a working girl
                                    or foreperson. Nell Nelson, being the series' author, received
                                    her own classification. Messenger became any character, without
                                    an inherent employment classification, who spoke on behalf of an
                                    absent person. Prominent Males and Prominent Females were
                                    characters who were of higher social standing than the working
                                    girls and who do not fall into any other archetype (ie.
                                    foreperson or employer). The benefactor was a male character who
                                    was the focus of a lengthy back and forth with Nelson in the
                                    August 2nd article. In several articles another reporter (not
                                    Nelson) spoke; therefore, that speaker was marked as reporter .
                                    Also, some articles incorporated the investigations of a health
                                    department inspector, who was marked inspector. Finally,
                                    unidentified was used to represent speaking characters when
                                    identity was unknown or unclear.</p>

                    <p>Once we had an idea of how the dialogue was distributed, we then wanted to
                        see how the different groups of people in the text took ownership of not
                        only the material things around them, but also other people in their lives.
                        We hypothesized that the employer would frequently take ownership of those
                        in his employ; however, the network analyses indicate even more interesting
                        relationships of ownership than what was expected. We have created numerous
                        network analyses: one for every article individually as well as one
                        including all of the articles and one for each of the unique project
                        archetypes. We've selected these four archetype networks that highlight
