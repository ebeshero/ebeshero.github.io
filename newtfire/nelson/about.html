                    <h1 class="page-header aboutH-main">Nell Nelson &amp; the "City Slave Girls"
                        Series</h1>
                    <p class="about">The series ran daily on the front page of The <i>Chicago
                            Times</i> in 1888. Helen Cusack-Carvalho posed as "Nell Nelson", a poor
                        female working girl and reported in-depth on the living conditions, wages,
                        and work environments of industrialized 19th-century Chicago. The early
                        publication of the series makes "Nelson" a pioneer of investigative
                        reporting with ground-breaking work exposing the mistreatment of women and
                        children.</p>
                    <p class="about">The success of her series is a bewilderment considering the
                        inversion of social norms represented in the writing of her expos√©. She
                        questioned the practices of the most prestigious men of Chicago through her
                        satirical and witty writing and beat the adversity of being a woman in the
                        19th-century since the publication of the series gained attention from
                        Chicago's political representatives and the owners of the companies
                        scrutinized.</p>
                    <p class="about">After the initial publication of the series, two books were
                        printed within the same year recognizing "Nelson" and her investigative
                        work. In addition to the two books, Nelson was hired by <i>The World</i> to
                        reproduce a similar series, in New York. Although the significance of the
                        series was recognized at the time of publication, Nelson's role in exposing
                        the hardships of the "City Slave Girls" lacks any proper representation in
                        modern history. The series should be a monumental resource for women's
                        history, labor history, and the history of undercover journalism.</p>
                    <p class="about">The biographical information on Helen Cusack-Carvalho is
                        illusive; currently, anything close to a complete biography of her is
                        nonexistent. The primary source of biographical information comes from a <a
                            href="http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/17511341211188655"
                            target="_blank">journal article</a> by Eric W. Liguori published in
                        2012. In this article, Liguori writes that Helen's career as a journalist
                        allowed her to maintain her middle-class status she was born into. Liguori
                        reports that Helen married above her social class, to a man named Solomon
                        Solis Carvalho, in 1895. After marriage, Helen's journalism career ceased to
                        exist, and she lived the remainder of her life raising their two daughters.
                        According to an obituary in a 1945 <i>New York Times</i>, Helen died in New
                        Jersey. The obituary lacks any special recognition of her investigative
                        series, despite its influential effects on the labor reforms of the late
                        19th-century.</p>

                                            was overhauling the markup of the articles. We worked to
                                            establish a system consistent with the <a

                                            possible. When evaluating our code, we considered three
                                            major ideas: the quantitative measure of dialogue
                                            dependent on gender and speaker, the relationship
                                            between possessive adjectives and their corresponding
                                            nouns, and Nell's distinct pool of vocabulary within her
                                            articles. We also changed the CSS, added SSI's, and
                                            established a <a

                                            system of coding in line with the Text Encoding
                                            Initiative (TEI). This was a major task; in working with

                                            that nearly every element needed to be replaced or
                                            renamed. On top of that, the <a

                                                target="_blank">initial markup</a> was inherently
                                            subjective by design. The prior code was intended to
                                            mark up points of connotation (such as sexual,
                                            sarcastic, positive, or negative). As a group, we
                                            discovered significant inconsistency in this
                                            interpretation of text from coder to coder. For example,
                                            what one person considered sarcastic, another considered
                                            sexual. This also posed the question of how much of the
                                            text needed to be wrapped. If a whole paragraph is
                                            sarcastic, should all of the sentences be wrapped? What
                                            if just one word seemed sarcastic? Our initial concept
                                            was to map these inconsistencies between coders. We
                                            thought that this, too, would cause an issue with time,
                                            forcing every indiviual within the project to read and
                                            mark up each article. After spending time bringing this
                                            inconsistent set of tags into the TEI, we made the
                                            ultimate decision to change the focus of our system. In
                                            doing so, we removed all tags representing
                                            connotations.</p>

                                            evaluating the quantity of dialogue between males and
                                            females and between speakers. We produced a bar graph

                                            speaker and another graph comparing the quantity of

                                            objective way to mark up Nelson's articles. Thanks to a
                                            suggestion from Prof. Greg Bondar, we began marking up
                                            grammatical elements. We decided to begin with both
                                            nouns and adjectives. This alone proved to be an
                                            immensely time-consuming task. This also proved to be
                                            quite complicated as well; each team member had to be
                                            instructed on the parts of speech. At times, nouns can
                                            act as adjectives (clothing factory). Other times, while
                                            we decided not to tag pronouns (he, she, it, etc.), we
                                            decided to tag possessive pronouns (my purse, his watch,
                                            their employees) and included an attribute to hold who
                                            or what it was referring to (using our set of
                                            'archetypes'). This is the tagging system: w @type
                                            @subtype @ana. 'w' represents both nouns and adjectives,
                                            defined by @type. @ana was used for the stem of the word
                                            for an adjective (laziest: type='adj' ana='lazy'), or it
                                            would be used as the 'archetype' of a noun if applicable
                                            (seamstress type='noun' ana='#workingGirl'). @subtype
                                            was used for adjectives that were possessive, and the
                                            @ana would then be the 'archetype' (his type='adj'
                                            subtype='poss' ana='#employer'). In order to keep
                                            adjectives tied with the nouns that they were modifying,
                                            the words were wrapped in element 'seg'.</p>

                                        <p class="carP-smaller">However, even this system required
                                            us to make some concessions with our system. The most
                                            prominent issue is the use of our 'seg' element to bind
                                            nouns and adjectives. One adjective is fine (lazy
                                            worker). Nouns with two or more adjectives also work
                                            with this system, as long as all of the adjectives are
                                            modifying the same noun (dumb lazy incompetent worker).
                                            Things become complicated when a noun is being modified
                                            by an adjective that is being modified by an adjective.
                                            Here is an example of a considerably complex issue:
                                            'pine board three feet long and sixteen inches wide'.
                                            Here, the base noun is board. Pine is a simple adjective
                                            modifying board. The issue comes when we consider the
                                            other modifiers: three feet long is mean to define the
                                            length of the board, but it is not easy to convey this
                                            through tags. 'Three' modifies 'feet', which modifies
                                            'long', which modifies 'board'. 'Long' can be marked as
                                            an adjective that modifies 'board', but that implies
                                            that the board itself is long (which is not the correct
                                            implication). Labeling 'three' as an adjective is
                                            correct, but with our system, it would seem that it is
                                            instead modifying 'board'. Ultimately, because we did
                                            not want to become tangled in 'seg' elements, the
                                            decision was made to 'ignore' these instances (three
                                            feet long @type='adj' @ana='long'). While still
                                            disingenuous, with the precise measurement and unit
                                            simply ignored, the idea that the property of length is
                                            discussed remains intact.</p>

                                        <p class="carP-smaller">This example also brings up the
                                            issue of units as adjectives: times, dates, ages,
                                            numerals, and prices. We created a system of rules to
                                            attribute for each case. For numerals of quantity or
                                            age, the @ana would be the number represented as a digit
                                            (thirty five @type='adj' @ana='35'). Dates, such as July
                                            13th or thirteenth, are ignored. Price and monetary
                                            values are defined as such: for either $5 or or $5.00 or
                                            five dollars: the number is represented as the
                                            attribute, like quantity. The noun is either the word or
                                            symbol for dollar. Decimal values are alllowed only if
                                            the original number inclues them ($1.23 @ana='1.23';
                                            $5.60 @ana='5.6'). The number is never converted to
                                            another value and is dependent on the unit that Nellson
                                            uses within the article; for example, cents should never
                                            be converted into dollars by the coder (63 cents is
                                            represented differently than $0.63). For time, instances
                                            like 6:00 and 6 o'clock are ignored; however, 6 hours
                                            past noon would be represented as such: the 'seg' around
                                            6 hours, with 6 as the adjective and hours as the noun.
                                            Noon is tagged outside of that 'seg', as its own
                                            individual 'w' element.</p>

                                            outputting a count for all the adjectives that appear
                                            more than twice. This is to display visually the
                                            interesting choice of language that Nelson makes with

                                            a table representing possessive nouns and pronouns and
                                            the nouns that are associated with them for each

                                            associated nouns. In doings so, we removed tagging for
                                            verbs and other nouns and adjectives. We also created a

                                            publications. For more information, visit the codebook

                                            network analysis graphs were produced to show possessive
                                            relationships. A basic reading view was also created for
