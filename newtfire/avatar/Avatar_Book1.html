               </span>	Uncle! Uncle, where are you?
            <span class="Other">Fire Nation Soldier:
               </span>	Sir, maybe he thought you left without him.
            <span class="Zuko">Zuko:
               </span>	Something's not right here. That pile of rocks.
            <span class="Other">Fire Nation Soldier:
               </span>	It looks like there's been a landslide, sir.
            <span class="Zuko">Zuko:
               </span>	Land doesn't slide uphill. Those rocks didn't move naturally. 
            <h3><i>[Stands up straight.]</i></h3> My Uncle's been captured by earthbenders!</p>

            <h3><i>Back to Iroh, who is surrounded by the soldiers.</i></h3>
            <span class="Other">Earthbender captain:
               </span>	These dangerous hands must be crushed. 
            <h3><i>[He brings up and prepares to drop it. However, Zuko jumps in and kicks the rock away
                  before breaking Iroh's chain with his boot.]</i></h3>
            <span class="Other">Iroh:
               </span>	Excellent form, Prince Zuko.
            <span class="Zuko">Zuko:
               </span>	You taught me well.
            <span class="Other">Earthbender captain:
               </span>	Surrender yourselves. It's five against two. You're clearly outnumbered.
            <span class="Other">Iroh:
               </span>	Yeah, that's true, but you are clearly outmatched.
            
            <h3><i>The solders fire rocks, but Iroh destroys them with the chains. Zuko takes out two
                  soldiers with fire. A rock is fired at him, but Iroh catches it and throws it back
                  at the soldiers, knocking them down. The Captain fires three rocks at Zuko, which
                  he dodges. Zuko counters with fire blasts that are dodged. The captain brings up a
                  large mass of rock, however, Iroh throws his chains around his ankles, knocking him
                  and causing the rocks to fall on top of him. The soldiers are heard groaning underneath
                  the rocks.</i></h3>
            <span class="Zuko">Zuko:
               </span>	Now would you please put on some clothes?</p>

            <span class="Other">Iroh:
               </span>	If you're fishing for an octopus my nephew, you need a tightly woven net, or he will squeeze through the tiniest hole and escape.
            <span class="Other">Zuko:
               </span>	I don't need your wisdom right now, Uncle.
            <span class="Other">Iroh:

            <h3><i>[Iroh hugs him.]</i></h3> After I have the Avatar.

                  He recovers, turns around and airbends up a huge cloud of dust around him and the

                  toward the dust cloud. Cut to inside the dust cloud, where Aang removes the Blue Spirit's
                  mask to reveal Zuko. Aang starts back in horror and falls backward on the ground.
                  He jumps up and runs away, but turns to look at Zuko, his eyes huge and full of compassion.
                  He sees the Fire Nation soldiers getting close through the smoke. Still, he hesitates.
                  When the dust clears, however, the soldiers find nothing. Cut back to Zhao, looking
                  insanely angry. A frog hops up onto the railing, croaks, and hops off.</i></h3>

                  the view is still blurry. He looks forlorn. Cut to Zuko, whose view we were clearly
                  just seeing. He looks a bit dazed still.</i></h3>

            <h3><i>[To Zuko.]</i></h3> You know what the worst part of being born over a hundred years ago is? I miss all
            the friends I used to hang out with. Before the war started, I used to always visit
            my friend Kuzon. The two of us, we'd get in and out of so much trouble together. He
            was one of the best friends I ever had, and he was from the Fire Nation, just like
            you. If we knew each other back then, do you think we could have been friends, too?

                  tree root. After a pause, Zuko lets loose a huge fireball at him, but Aang dodges
                  and flies away on a current of air. Zuko watches him hop away from tree branch to
                  tree branch and out sight. Cut to Zuko as the camera slowly zooms backward. Zuko raises

            <span class="Other">Bujing:
               </span>	I don't. They'll be used as a distraction while we mount an attack from the rear.

            <span class="Other">Iroh:

            But Zuko misunderstood. 
            <h3><i>[Flashback shows an overview of the chamber; the camera cuts to show Zuko preparing
                  for the Agni Kai.]</i></h3> When he turned to face his opponent, he was surprised to see it was not the general.
            
            <h3><i>[Flashback shows the tippet that was on Zuko's shoulders fall down to the ground.]</i></h3> Zuko had spoken out against the general's plan, but by doing so in the Fire Lord's war room, it was the Fire Lord whom he had disrespected. 
            <h3><i>[Frontal shot of a surprised Zuko; as the camera zooms in on him, his expression changes
                  to one of fear.]</i></h3> Zuko would have to duel his own father.

            Avatar. Only then could he return with his honor.
            <span class="Other">Jee:
               </span>	So that's why he's so obsessed. Capturing the Avatar is the only chance he has of things returning to normal.

               </span>	Finally! 
            <h3><i>[He turns around to face another person in uniform, who sits at a small table.]</i></h3> Uncle, do you realize what this means?!

            <h3><i>[He is playing some sort of card game. He answers calmly while looking over the tile

               </span>	
            <h3><i>[Turning around again to face the light.]</i></h3> It means my search is about to come to an end.
            
            <h3><i>Iroh sighs uninterestedly and places his tile on the table.</i></h3>
            <span class="Zuko">Zuko:
               </span>	
            <h3><i>[Gestures at the light while facing his uncle again.]</i></h3> That light came from an incredibly powerful source! 
            <h3><i>[The light dwindles and disappears.]</i></h3> It has to be him!
            <span class="Other">Iroh:
               </span>	
            <h3><i>[With continuing disinterest and an air of skepticism.]</i></h3> Or it's just the celestial lights. We've been down this road before, Prince Zuko. 
            <h3><i>[He looks at the tile in his hand, depicting the symbol of airbending.]</i></h3> I don't want you to get too excited over nothing. 
            <h3><i>[He places it on a tile carrying the symbol of firebending and gestures toward the
                  open place at the other side of the table while continuing in a relaxed voice.]</i></h3> Please, sit. Why don't you enjoy a cup of calming Jasmine tea?
            <span class="Zuko">Zuko:
               </span>	
            <h3><i>[Furiously, still facing Iroh.]</i></h3> I don't need any calming tea! I need to capture the Avatar! Helmsman, head a course for the light!
            
            <h3><i>Zuko points in the direction of where the light once was. Iroh calmly continues with
                  his game, placing another tile bearing the airbending symbol on the previous one.

               </span>	I finally have you, but I can't get you home because of this blizzard. 
            <h3><i>[Stands up and looks outside the cave.]</i></h3> There's always something. Not that you would understand. You're like my sister. Everything
            always came easy to her. She's a firebending prodigy, and everyone adores her. My
            father says she was born lucky. He says I was lucky to be born. I don't need luck,
            though. I don't want it. I've always had to struggle and fight and that's made me
            strong. It's made me who I am.</p>
         
         
         <p>Cut to Aang entering the cave, filling it with light. Cut to Aang waking up, attempting
            to get out of his restraints and noticing Zuko.
