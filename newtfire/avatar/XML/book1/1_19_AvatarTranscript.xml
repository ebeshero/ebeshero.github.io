<scene><sd>Cuts inside a room where Zuko prepares a boat, winding up some rope. Iroh enters.</sd>
<speaker ref="">Iroh</speaker>	If you're fishing for an octopus <char ref="Zuko">my nephew</char>, you need a tightly woven net, or he will squeeze through the tiniest hole and escape.
<speaker ref="">Zuko</speaker>	I don't need your wisdom right now, <char ref="Iroh">Uncle</char>.

<speaker ref="">Zuko</speaker>	<char ref="Iroh">Uncle</char>, you don't have to say it.

<speaker ref="">Zuko</speaker>	I will. <sd>[Lowers the boat, suspended by ropes, down the side of the ship into the water.]</sd>
<speaker ref="">Iroh</speaker>	And put your hood up. Keep your ears warm!
<speaker ref="">Zuko</speaker>	I'll be fine!</scene>
