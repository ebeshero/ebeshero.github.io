            <scene n="1">
<sd>Scene changes to a flashback. Zuko walks up to the curtains to get in the war room, but the guard on the left moves in front of the curtain to stop him.</sd>
<sp><speaker ref="Y. Zuko">Young Zuko</speaker>	Let me in!</sp>
<sp><speaker ref="FlashB Iroh">Iroh</speaker>	<sd>[Places his hands on Zuko's shoulders.]</sd> <char ref="Y. Zuko">Prince Zuko</char>, what's wrong?</sp>
<sp><speaker ref="Y. Zuko">Young Zuko</speaker>	I want to go into the war chamber <sd>[Points to the guard.]</sd> but the guard won't let me pass!</sp>
<sp><speaker ref="FlashB Iroh">Iroh</speaker>	<sd>[Leads Zuko away with his left hand still on his shoulder.]</sd> You're not missing anything, trust me. These meetings are dreadfully boring.</sp>
<sp><speaker ref="Y. Zuko">Young Zuko</speaker>	If I'm going to rule this nation one day, don't you think I need to start learning as much as I can?</sp>
<sp><speaker ref="FlashB Iroh">Iroh</speaker>	Very well. But you must promise not to speak. <sd>[Another elder soldier walks by them into the war chamber.]</sd> These old folks are a bit sensitive, you know?</sp>
<sp><speaker ref="Y. Zuko">Young Zuko</speaker>	<sd>[Bows to Iroh.]</sd> Thank you, <char ref="FlashB Iroh">Uncle</char>.</sp>
<sd>Zuko and Iroh walk into the war room. The meeting starts.</sd>
<sp><speaker ref="Buijing">Bujing</speaker>	The Earth Kingdom defenses are concentrated here. <sd>[Bujing shows the place on the map.]</sd> A dangerous battalion of their strongest earthbenders and fiercest warriors. So I am recommending the forty-first division.</sp>
<sp><speaker ref="EFNSoldier">Elder Soldier</speaker>	But the forty-first is entirely new recruits. How do you expect them to defeat a powerful Earth Kingdom battalion?</sp>
<sp><speaker ref="Buijing">Bujing</speaker>	I don't. They'll be used as a distraction while we mount an attack from the rear. What better to use as bait than fresh meat?</sp>
<sp><speaker ref="Y. Zuko">Young Zuko</speaker>	<sd>[Zuko is shown standing up.]</sd> You can't sacrifice an entire division like that! Those soldiers love and defend our nation! How can you betray them?</sp>
<sd>Camera shows everyone in the war room staring at Zuko, save for Iroh, who is kneeling behind his nephew. The scene changes back to the present time.</sd>
<sp><speaker ref="Iroh">Iroh</speaker>	Zuko was right, you see, <sd>[Massages his beard again.]</sd> but it was not his place to speak out. And there were dire consequences. <sd>[Slightly bows his head.]</sd></sp>
<sd>A flashback appears of the fire in front of the Fire Lord's throne rising.</sd>
<sp><speaker ref="Iroh">Iroh</speaker>	After <char ref="Y. Zuko">Zuko's</char> outburst in the meeting, the <char ref="Ozai">Fire Lord</char> became very angry with him. <sd>[Flashback quickly ends.]</sd> He said the challenge against the general was an act of complete disrespect! And there was only one way to resolve this.</sp>
<sp><speaker ref="Jee">Jee</speaker>	Agni Kai. A fire duel.</sp>
<sp><speaker ref="Iroh">Iroh</speaker>	That's right. <char ref="Zuko">Zuko</char> looked upon the old general he had insulted and declared that he was not afraid. But <char ref="Zuko">Zuko</char> misunderstood. <sd>[Flashback shows an overview of the chamber; the camera cuts to show Zuko preparing for the Agni Kai.]</sd> When he turned to face his opponent, he was surprised to see it was not the general. <sd>[Flashback shows the tippet that was on Zuko's shoulders fall down to the ground.]</sd> <char ref="Zuko">Zuko</char> had spoken out against the general's plan, but by doing so in the <char ref="Ozai">Fire Lord's</char> war room, it was the <char ref="Ozai">Fire Lord</char> whom he had disrespected. <sd>[Frontal shot of a surprised Zuko; as the camera zooms in on him, his expression changes to one of fear.]</sd> <char ref="Zuko">Zuko</char> would have to duel his own father.</sp>
<sp><speaker ref="Iroh">Iroh</speaker>	When <char ref="Y. Zuko">Prince Zuko</char> saw that it was <char ref="Ozai">his father</char> who had come to duel him, he begged for mercy.</sp>
<sd>Flashback shows a side overview of the Agni Kai chamber where Ozai is advancing on Zuko.</sd>
<sp><speaker ref="Y. Zuko">Young Zuko</speaker>	<sd>[Cut to a side-view of Zuko.]</sd> Please, <char ref="Ozai">Father</char>. I only had the Fire Nation's best interest at heart. I'm sorry I spoke out of turn! <sd>[Slightly lowers his head.]</sd></sp>
<sd>Cut to a frontal shot from a worm's eye perspective of Ozai's silhouette walking up to Zuko.</sd>
<sp><speaker ref="Ozai">Ozai</speaker>	You will fight for your honor.</sp>
<sp><speaker ref="Y. Zuko">Young Zuko</speaker>	<sd>[Frontal shot; kneels on his knees and forearms, while looking at the floor.]</sd> I meant you no disrespect. <sd>[Gazes up at his father, tears shimmering in his eyes as his voice starts to waver.]</sd> I am your loyal son.</sp>
<sp><speaker ref="Ozai">Ozai</speaker>	<sd>[Far off frontal shot of Zuko as Ozai's shadow and eventually his head come into view.]</sd> Rise and fight, <char ref="Zuko">Prince Zuko</char>!</sp>
<sd>Cut to a side-view from behind some of the spectators as Ozai reaches Zuko, who lowers his head to the floor again.</sd>
<sp><speaker ref="Y. Zuko">Young Zuko</speaker>	I won't fight you.</sp>
<sp><speaker ref="Ozai">Ozai</speaker>	You will learn respect, <sd>[Zuko pushes himself up on his knees and hands. Cut to a frontal shot of Zuko as he starts to shake.]</sd> and suffering will be your <sd>[Zuko looks up at Ozai, tears streaming down his face.]</sd> teacher.</sp>
<sd>Cut to a frontal view of Zhao, Iroh, and Azula in the crowd. While Iroh clenches his teeth and looks fearful and worried on Zuko's behalf, Zhao looks on with a smirk on his face, while Azula smiles and raises her left fist in front of her chest in anticipation.</sd>
<sp><speaker ref="Iroh">Iroh</speaker>	<sd>[Voice-over; Iroh closes his eyes and averts his head to the left.]</sd> I looked away.</sp>
<sd>As the sound of a fire blast is heard, Zuko is screaming "no", which echoes. While the faces of the spectators are brightened by the flames, the camera slowly zooms in on Iroh's averted face. The scene switches from the past to the present, where Iroh is sitting in the same manner.</sd>
<sp><speaker ref="Jee">Jee</speaker>	I always thought that <char ref="Zuko">Prince Zuko</char> was in a training accident.</sp>
<sp><speaker ref="Iroh">Iroh</speaker>	It was no accident. After the duel, the <char ref="Ozai">Fire Lord</char> said that by refusing to fight, <char ref="Zuko">Zuko</char> had shown shameful weakness. As punishment, he was banished and sent to capture the <char ref="Aang">Avatar</char>. Only then could he return with his honor.</sp>
<sp><speaker ref="Jee">Jee</speaker>	So that's why he's so obsessed. Capturing the <char ref="Aang">Avatar</char> is the only chance he has of things returning to normal.</sp>
<sp><speaker ref="Jee">Iroh</speaker>	Things will never return to normal. But the important thing is the <char ref="Aang">Avatar</char> gives <char ref="Zuko">Zuko</char> hope.</sp>
<sd>Scene changes to show Zuko meditating, while having flashbacks of his younger life. He is stopped by a hit on the ship.</sd></scene>
            
            <scene n="2">
<sd>Scene changes to Zuko's ship, with Zuko on the deck.</sd>
<sp><speaker ref="Zuko">Zuko</speaker>	Where were we hit?</sp>
<sp><speaker ref="Jee">Jee</speaker>	I don't know!</sp>
<sp><speaker ref="Iroh">Iroh</speaker>	Look!</sp>
<sp><speaker ref="Zuko">Zuko</speaker>	<char ref="Helms">The helmsman</char>!</sp>
<sd>Zuko and Lieutenant Jee are shown climbing up a ladder to help a man who is about to fall. Lightning goes down to the middle of the ship, where Iroh is. He uses redirection so it does not damage the ship.</sd> 
<sd>Zuko is shown spotting Appa.</sd>
<sp><speaker ref="Zuko">Zuko</speaker>	The <char ref="Aang">Avatar</char>!</sp>
<sp><speaker ref="Jee">Jee</speaker>	What do you want to do, sir?</sp>
<sp><speaker ref="Zuko">Zuko</speaker>	Let him go. We need to get this ship to safety.</sp>
<sp><speaker ref="Iroh">Iroh</speaker>	Then we must head directly into the eye of the storm.</sp></scene>

<scene n="3"><sd>Scene changes to Zuko and Iroh together.</sd>
<sp><speaker ref="Zuko">Zuko</speaker>	<char ref="Iroh">Uncle</char>, I'm sorry.</sp>
<sp><speaker ref="Iroh">Iroh</speaker>	Your apology is accepted.</sp></scene>
