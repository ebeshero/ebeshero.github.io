            <p>At this stage in our production, there are still plenty of research questions that we
                are interested in pursuing. There are several possibilities, such as looking at the
                use of emojis within the texting conventions, any speech errors made by the non
                native speakers (and whether or not they are corrected by the native speaker),
                extended pauses between links of text, and any characteristic use of
                punctuation.</p>
