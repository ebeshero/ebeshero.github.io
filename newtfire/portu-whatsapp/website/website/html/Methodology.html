            <p>The intent of this project is to look at linguistic characteristics that may make
                themselves evident through texting conventions. Some of the characterisitcs that
                this project may look into include lengthy pauses between speaking(?) segments, any
                identifying or intersting use of punctuation, the use, or lack there of, emojis, as
                well as any speech errors (via texting), whether or not they are corrected byt he
                native speaker.</p>
