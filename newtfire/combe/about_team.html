                        <p><strong>Dorothea Lint</strong> is a senior at the University of Pittsburgh at Greensburg,
                            majoring in English Literature, minoring in Psychology, and pursuing the
                            Digital Humanities Certificate. She has tripped into research on William
                            Combe, thinks he is quite amusing and under-rated--not at all the hack
                            everyone describes him as, and believes his works should be given more
                            respect in the cannon of English Literature, if only people knew what he
                            wrote! In her spare time, Dorothea rescues cats, ghost-writes for a
                            lovable rottweiler's blog, dietingdog.com, and is attempting to write
                            some kind of legitimate English stuff anybody who ended up on this site
                            will probably eventually see!</p>

                            She is a junior who is majoring in Computer Science and pursuing the
                            Digital Humanities Certificate. When not in class, she likes to spend
                            time with her son, Parker. For the Combe Project, Alyssa did the web
                            design.</p>
