            <div class="stanza">
               <p>The school was done,</p>
               <p>the bus'ness o'er,</p>
               <p>When, tir'd of Greek</p>
               <p>and Latin lore,</p>
               <p>Good SYNTAX sought</p>
               <p>his easy chair,</p>
               <p>And sat in calm composure there.</p>
               <p>His wife was to a neighbour gone,</p>
               <p>To hear the chit-chat of the town;</p>
               <p>And left him the unfrequent power</p>
               <p>Of brooding through a quiet hour.</p>
               <p>Thus, while he sat, a busy train</p>
               <p>Of images besieged his brain.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="stanza">
               <p>Of church-preferment he had none;</p>
               <p>Nay, all his hope of that was gone:</p>
               <p>He felt that he content must be</p>
               <p>With drudging in a curacy.</p>
               <p>Indeed, on ev'ry Sabbath-day,</p>
               <p>Through eight long miles he took his way,</p>
               <p>To preach, to grumble, and to pray;</p>
               <p>To cheer the good, to warn the sinner,</p>
               <p>And, if he got it,--eat a dinner:</p>
               <p>To bury these, to christen those,</p>
               <p>And marry such fond folks as chose</p>
               <p>To change the tenor of their life,</p>
               <p>And risk the matrimonial strife.</p>
               <p>Thus were his weekly journies made, 'Neath summer suns and wintry shade; </p>
               <p>And all his gains, it did appear,</p>
               <p>Were only thirty pounds a-year.</p>
               <p>Besides, th'augmenting taxes press,</p>
               <p>To aid expense and add distress:</p>
               <p>Mutton and beef, and bread and beer,</p>
               <p>And ev'ry thing was grown so dear;</p>
               <p>The boys, too, always prone to eat,</p>
               <p>Delighted less in books than meat;</p>
               <p>So that, when holy Christmas came,</p>
               <p>His earnings ceas'd to be the same,</p>
               <p>And now, alas! could do no more,</p>
               <p>Than keep the wolf without the door.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="stanza">
               <p>E'en birch, the pedant master's boast,</p>
               <p>Was so increas'd in worth and cost,</p>
               <p>That oft, prudentially beguil'd,</p>
               <p>To save the rod, he spar'd the child.</p>
               <p>Thus, if the times refus'd to mend,</p>
               <p>He to his school must put an end.</p>
               <p>How hard his lot! how blind his fate!</p>
               <p>What shall he do to mend his state?</p>
               <p>Thus did poor Syntax ruminate;</p>
               <p>When, as the vivid meteros fly,</p>
               <p>And instant light the gloomy sky,</p>
               <p>A sudden thought across him came,</p>
               <p>And told the way to wealth and fame;</p>
               <p>And, as th' expanding vision grew</p>
               <p>Wider and wider to his view,</p>
               <p>The painted fancy did beguile</p>
               <p>His woe-worn phiz into a smile:</p>
               <p>But, while he pac'd the room around,</p>
               <p>Or stood immers'd in thought profound,</p>
               <p>THe Doctor, 'midst his rumination,</p>
               <p>Was waken'd by a visitation</p>
               <p>Which troubles many a poor man's life-</p>
               <p>The visitation of his wife.</p>
               <p>Good Mrs. Syntax was a lady,</p>
               <p>Ten years, perhaps, beyond her hey-day;</p>
               <p>But though the blooming charms had flown,</p>
               <p>That grac'd her youth, it still was known</p>
            </div>
            <div class="stanza">
               <p>The love of power she had never lost,</p>
               <p>As Syntax found it to his cost;</p>
               <p>For as her words were used to flow,</p>
               <p>He but replied or YES or NO.</p>
               <p>Whene'er enrag'd by some disaster,</p>
               <p>She'd shake the boys and cuff the master;</p>
               <p>Nay, to avenge the slightest wrong,</p>
               <p>She could employ both arms and tongue;</p>
               <p>And, if we list to country tales,</p>
               <p>She sometimes would enforce her nails.</p>
               <p>Her face was red, her form was fat,</p>
               <p>A round-about, and rather squat;</p>
               <p>And when in angry humour stalking,</p>
               <p>Was like a dumpling set a-walking. 'Twas not the custom of this spouse </p>
               <p>To suffer long a quiet house:</p>
               <p>She was among those busy wives,</p>
               <p>Who hurry-scurry through their lives;</p>
               <p>And make amends for fading beauty</p>
               <p>By telling husbands of their duty.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="stanza">
               <p>'Twas at this moment, when, inspir'd,</p>
               <p>And by his new ambition fir'd,</p>
               <p>The pious man his hands uprear'd,</p>
               <p>The pious man his hands uprear'd,</p>
               <p>The Mrs. Syntax re-appear'd:</p>
               <p>Amaz'd she look'd, and loud she shriek'd,</p>
               <p>Or, rather like a pig she squeak'd,</p>
            </div>
            <div class="stanza">
               <p>To see her humble husband dare</p>
               <p>Thus quit his sober ev'ning chair,</p>
               <p>And pace, with varying steps, about,</p>
               <p>Now in the room, and now without.</p>
               <p>At first, she did not find her tongue, (A thing which seldom happen'd long,) </p>
               <p>But soon that organ grew unquiet,</p>
               <p>To ask the cause of all this riot.</p>
               <p>The Doctor smil'd, and thus address'd</p>
               <p>The secrets of his lab'ring breast-</p>

            <div class="stanza">

               <p>For such a plan has come athwart me,</p>
               <p>Which some kind sprite from Heav'n has brought me</p>
               <p>That if you will your counsels join,</p>

               <p>And teeming plenty crown the year:</p>
               <p>We then on dainty bits shall dine,</p>
               <p>And change our home-brew'd ale for wine:</p>
               <p>On summer days, to take the air,</p>
               <p>We'll put our Grizzle to a chair;</p>

               <p>And neighb'ring folks be forc'd to own,</p>
               <p>In this fair town you give the ton." "Oh! tell me," cried the smiling dame, "Tell

               <p>On ev'ry day of ev'ry year,</p>
               <p>So small her share of true discerning,</p>
               <p>She turn'd her back on all my learning.</p>
               <p>I've in her vineyard labour'd hard,</p>
               <p>And what has been my lean reward?</p>
               <p>I've dug the ground, while some rich Vicar</p>
               <p>Press'd the ripe grape, and drank the liquor;</p>
               <p>I feed the flock, while others eat</p>
               <p>The mutton's nice, delicious meat;</p>

               <p>But, ah! too soon the vision passes,</p>
               <p>Confounded by a pack of asses!</p>

               <p>And as he star'd, and look'd around,</p>

               <p>Nor dogs to bark, nor cocks to crow,</p>
               <p>Nor sheep to bleat, nor herds to low</p>
               <p>Nay, if these asses did not bray,</p>
               <p>And thus some signs of life betray,</p>
               <p>I well might think that I were hurl'd</p>

               <p>Three ruffians issued from a bush;</p>
               <p>One Grizzle stopp'd, and seiz'd the reins,</p>

               <p>Poor Syntax, trembling with affright,</p>

               <p>Nor was this all; his pate was bare,</p>

               <p>For when the sturdy robbers took him,</p>

               <p>When each leap'd quickly from her steed,</p>
               <p>To join in charitable deed.</p>
               <p>They drew their knives to cut the noose,</p>

               <p>The rustic matrons sooth his grief,</p>
               <p>Nor offer, but afford relief;</p>
               <p>And, turning from the beaten road,</p>
               <p>Their well-lin'd panniers they unload;</p>
               <p>When soon upon the bank appear'd</p>
               <p>A sight his fainting spirits cheer'd:</p>
               <p>They spread the fare with cheerful grace,</p>
               <p>And gave a banquet to the place.</p>
               <p>Most haply, too, as they untied him,</p>
               <p>He saw his hat and wig beside him:</p>
               <p>So, thus bewigg'd and thus behatted,</p>
               <p>Down on the grass the Doctor squatted;</p>
               <p>When he uplifted either eye,</p>

               <p>"'Tis thus," he humbly said, "we read</p>

               <p>But where is Grizzle?-Never mind her;</p>
               <p>I'll have her cried, and soon shall find her."</p>
               <p>Thus he pursued the winding way,</p>
               <p>Big with the evils of the day</p>
               <p>Though the good Doctor kept in view</p>
               <p>The favour of its blessings too.</p>
               <p>Nor had he pac'd it half an hour,</p>
               <p>Before he saw a parish tow'r,</p>
               <p>And soon, with sore fatigue opprest,</p>
               <p>An inn receiv'd him as its guest.</p>
               <p>But still his mind, with anxious care,</p>
               <p>Ponder'd upon his wand'ring mare;</p>
               <p>He, therefore, sent the bellman round,</p>
               <p>To see if Grizzle might be found.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="stanza">
               <p>Grizzle, ungrateful to her master,</p>
               <p>And careless of his foul disaster,</p>
               <p>Left him tied up, and took her way,</p>
               <p>In hopes to meet with corn or hay;</p>
               <p>But, as that did not come to pass,</p>
               <p>She sought a meadow full of grass:</p>
               <p>The farmer in the meadow found her,</p>
               <p>And order'd John, his man, to pound her:</p>
               <p>Now John was one of those droll folk,</p>
               <p>Who oft take mischief for a joke;</p>
            </div>
            <div class="stanza">
               <p>And thought 'twould make the master stare,</p>
               <p>When he again beheld his mare,</p>
               <p>(Perhaps the gem'man might be shockt)</p>
               <p>To find her ready cropt and dockt:</p>
               <p>At all events, he play'd his fun:</p>
               <p>No sooner was it said than done.</p>
               <p>But Grizzle was a patient beast,</p>
               <p>And minded nought if she could feast:</p>
               <p>Like many others, prone to think</p>
               <p>The best of life was meat and drink,</p>
               <p>Who feel to-day nor care nor sorrow,</p>
               <p>If they are sure to feast to-morrow:</p>
               <p>Thus Grizzle, as she pac'd around</p>
               <p>The purlieu of the barren pound,</p>
            </div>
            <div class="stanza">
               <p>In hungry mood might seem to neigh-</p>

            </div>
            <div class="stanza">
               <p>In the meantime, securely hous'd,</p>
               <p>The Doctor booz'd it, and carous'd,</p>
               <p>The Hostess spread her fairest cheer,</p>
               <p>Her best beef-steak, her strongest beer;</p>
               <p>And sooth'd him with her winning chat,</p>
               <p>Of-"Pray eat this-and now take that.</p>
               <p>Your Rev'rence, after all your fright,</p>
               <p>Wants meat and drink to set you right."</p>
               <p>His Rev'rence prais'd the golden rule,</p>
               <p>Nor did he let his victuals cool;</p>
               <p>And, having drunk his liquor out,</p>
               <p>He took a turn to look about.</p>
               <p>When to the folks about the door,</p>
               <p>He told the dismal story o'er,</p>
               <p>The country-people on him gaz'd,</p>
               <p>And heard his perils all amaz'd:</p>
               <p>How the thieves twin'd the cords around him</p>
               <p>How to a tree the villains bound him!</p>
               <p>What angels came to his relief.</p>
               <p>To loose his bonds, and soothe his grief!</p>
               <p>His loss of cash, and what was worse,</p>
               <p>His saddle, saddle-bags, and horse!</p>
            </div>
            <div class="stanza">
               <p>Thus, as their rude attention hung</p>
               <p>Upon the wonders of his tongue,</p>
               <p>Lo! Grizzle's alter'd form appears,</p>
               <p>With half its tail, and half its ears!</p>
               <p>"Is there no law?" the Doctor cries:-</p>
               <p>"Plenty," a lawyer straight replies:</p>
               <p>"Employ me, and those thieves shall swing</p>
               <p>On gallows-tree, in hempen-string:</p>
               <p>And, for the rogue, the law shall flea him,</p>
               <p>Who maim'd your horse, as now you see him."</p>
               <p>"No," quoth the Don, "your pardon, pray;</p>
               <p>I've had enough of thieves to-day:</p>
               <p>I've lost four shillings and a groat,</p>
               <p>But you would strip me of my coat;</p>
               <p>And ears and tail won't fatten you,</p>
               <p>You'll want the head and carcase too."</p>
               <p>He chuckled as he made the stroke,</p>
               <p>And all around enjoy'd the joke;</p>
               <p>But still it was a sorry sight,</p>
               <p>To see the beast in such a plight:</p>
               <p>Yet what could angry Syntax do?</p>
               <p>'Twas all in vain to fret and stew:</p>
               <p>His well-stuff'd bags, with all their hoard</p>
               <p>Of sketching-tools, were safe restor'd;</p>
               <p>The saddle, too, which he had sought,</p>
               <p>For small reward was quickly brought;</p>
               <p>He therefore thought it far more sage,</p>
               <p>To stop his threats and check his rage;</p>
            </div>
            <div class="stanza">
               <p>So to the ostler's faithful care</p>
               <p>He gave his mutilated mare:</p>
               <p>And while poor Grizzle, free from danger,</p>
               <p>Cropp'd the full rack and clean'd the manger,</p>
               <p>Syntax, to ease his aching head,</p>
               <p id="c4">Smok'd out his pipe, and went to bed.</p>

               <p>So bid the maid to let him know</p>

               <p>Undrew the curtains, one by one;</p>

               <p>Betty, obedient to his will,</p>

               <p>Down the long page he cast his eye,</p>
               <p>Then shook his head, and heav'd a sigh,</p>
               <p>"What! am I doom'd, where'er I go,</p>
               <p>In all I meet to find a foe?</p>

               <p>And for a moment veil'd the skies,</p>

            <div class="stanza">
               <p>By the way-side the cottage rose,</p>
               <p>Around it many a willow grows,</p>
               <p>Where Syntax, in a tone of grief,</p>
               <p>Shew'd Grizzle's wounds, and pray'd relief.</p>
               <p>The sooty Galen soon appear'd,</p>
               <p>And with fair hopes the Doctor cheer'd.</p>
               <p>"Trust me, good Sir, I've got a plaster,</p>
               <p>Will cure the beast of her disaster;</p>
               <p>And, while the dressing I prepare,</p>
               <p>With all becoming skill and care,</p>
               <p>You in that arbour may regale,</p>
               <p>With a cool pipe and jug of ale:</p>

               <p>And med'cine sell for man and beast."</p>
               <p>Syntax now sought the cooling shade,</p>
               <p>While Galen's dame the banquet made:</p>
               <p>She well knew how her guests to please,</p>
               <p>And added meat, and bread, and cheese:</p>
               <p>Besides, she told the village-tale--</p>
               <p>Who came to drink her home-brew'd ale;</p>
               <p>How that the laughter-loving Vicar</p>

               <p>That their gay landlord was renown'd,</p>
               <p>For hunting fox, with horns and hound;</p>
               <p>That he'd a daughter passing fair,</p>
               <p>Who was his honour's only heir;</p>
            </div>
            <div class="stanza">
               <p>But she was proud, nor could a squire</p>

               <p>Became a subject for the dame;</p>
               <p>And thus she play'd her chatt'ring part,</p>
               <p>Till Syntax thought it time to start.</p>
               <p>And now poor Grizzle re-appears,</p>
               <p>With plaster'd tail, and plaster'd ears,</p>
               <p>Which thus cas'd up, might well defy</p>

               <p>An inn receiv'd him for the night,</p>
               <p>His frame fatigu'd, his mind oppress'd,</p>
               <p>He tiff'd his punch, and went to rest.</p>
               <p>The morning came, when he arose</p>
               <p>In spirits from his calm repose;</p>
               <p>And while the maid prepar'd the tea,</p>
               <p>He look'd around the room to see</p>

               <p>Of human joys, of human woes.</p>
               <p>The window quickly caught his eye,</p>
