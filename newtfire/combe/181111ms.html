                  <p><span>It is ingeniously observed by an eminent moral as well as philosophical
                              writer, that comic playwrights exaggerate every character, and draw
                              their fop or spendthrift, their bully or sharper, their old maid or
                              coquette, with stronger features than are any where to be met with in
                              nature. Indeed, this kind of dramatic painting may be compared to
                              pictures designed for domes and ceilings, where, to produce their
                              proper effect, the colours must be heightened, and the forms of the
                              figures enlarged beyond their natural appearance. Thus the objects of
                              the composition seem monstrous when seen too nigh, but acquire a due
                              proportion when examined in the precise view in which the painter
                              designed them to be surveyed. </span></p>
                  <p><span>This kind of exaggeration, when applied to the stage, is, I think, to be
                              allowed only when the writer means not merely to describe a character,
                              but a passion. In the former it becomes him to keep close to his
                              original, otherwise he launches into caricature, and consequently
                              gives impressions that deceive, instead of affording instruction; but
                              in the latter, where the vice or the folly in all its tendencies and
                              ramifications is compressed into one form, when, instead of
                              representing an individual as he is seen under the partial influence
                              of any predominant passion, the whole is condensed into one mind, and
                              operates in all possible directions, it is no longer a natural
                              representation, because Nature disdains such a compound: at the same
                              time, when it is managed with skill, the effect on the spectator may,
                              in certain cases, be rendered very powerful in producing moral
                              instruction and improvement, which is the legitimate object of all
                              dramatic productions. </span></p>
                  <p><span>This seems to have been the design of <span class="persName"
                                    >Moliere</span> in his play of <span class="emph"
                              >L’Avare</span>, which, having been translated into English, and
                              frequently acted on our stage under the title of the <span
                                    class="emph">Miser</span>, is well known to all who are fond of
                              the drama. This character is not intended to represent an ordinary
                              miser, but to be the personification of avarice itself; which, though
                              one of the most detestable passions of the human breast, furnishes,
                              perhaps, more ridiculous varieties than any other; and while it
                              creates as much disgust as the understanding which contemplates it can
                              feel, its conduct is pregnant with circumstances equally calculated to
                              produce mirth; at the same time its distresses are generally of a
                              nature which the most benevolent heart cannot regard with
                              commiseration. </span></p>
                  <p><span>Hence it is that the moralists and philosophers of all ages, who have
                              attacked this irreclaimable vice, appear to have preferred the weapons
                              of wit and humour, in order to create the laugh against it; than those
                              of serious argument and solemn observation, to awaken grave sentiment
                              and moral abhorrence. Thus we find ourselves, as it were, habitually
                              disposed to make avaricious characters the objects rather of a
                              laughing derision, than bitter reproach. Who, it may be asked, can
                              check sensations of merriment at the following stories of misers,
                              though represented to be in the most awful of all situations – the
                              hour of death? </span></p>
                  <p><span>An old usurer, stretched on his sick bed, and in his last agonies, was
                              presented by the priest with a rich crucifix as an object of worship
                              and consolation. He opens his eyes, considers the cross, and exclaims,
                              ere he expires—"Those jewels are all false, and I can only lend five
                              pounds on such a pledge." </span></p>
                  <p><span>Another well known miser, finding himself at his last hour, sent for some
                              of the directors of a neighbouring charity, and gave them a bill of a
                              hundred pounds, payable after his decease, which sum he ordered to be
                              disposed of in the service of their institution; but they had not left
                              the room many minutes when he ordered them to be called back, and
                              offered them ready money if they would allow him the discount. I do
                              not answer for the authenticity of these stories, though our own
                              experience will, I should imagine, furnish us with similar instances
                              of persevering avarice. </span></p>
                  <p><span>One of the best fables of La Motte is on this subject, and does not fail
                              in giving pleasantry to its moral.--"A miser being dead, and, which is
                              of consequence on the occasion, being interred, arrived at the banks
                              of the <span class="placeName">Styx</span>, and desired to be ferried
                              over with the other ghosts. <span class="persName">Charon</span>,
                              however, insisted on his fare; and was equally disappointed and
                              surprised when he saw the miser, in order to avoid paying it, throw
                              himself into the river, and swim over to the other side, in spite of
                              all the clamour and opposition which the unexpected attempt
                              occasioned. All hell was in an uproar; and each of the judges
                              meditated some punishment proportioned to a crime of such dangerous
                              consequence to the infernal revenues. Shall he be chained to the rock
                              with <span class="persName"><span class="emph"
                                    >Prometheus</span></span>? or tremble beneath the precipice in
                              company with the <span class="persName"><span class="emph"
                                          >Danaides</span></span>? or assist <span class="persName"
                                          ><span class="emph">Sisyphus</span></span> in rolling his
                              stone? were the questions which issued from the tribunal. 'No,' said
                                    <span class="persName"><span class="emph">Minos</span></span>;
                              'none of these is sufficient, we must invent some severer punishment.
                              Let him be sent back to the earth, to see the use which his heirs are
                              making of his riches.'" </span></p>
                  <p><span>Just as I had finished this lively apologue, I received the following
                              letter, which, though it is not an immediate branch of the subject
                              before me, may be considered as bearing such a relation to it, as to
                              justify its present insertion. Besides, I may, at any time, write an
                              essay on Avarice; but it is not always in my power to oblige a young
                              lady of talents and beauty. That my fair correspondent possesses the
                              former, her letter sufficiently proves; and that she is adorned with
                              the latter, I am most willing to believe, as I have her own authority
                              for it. </span></p>
                  <div class="letter">
                        <p><span class="letter">Mr. SPECTATOR,</span></p>
                        <p><span class="letter">It is now six months, sir, since I attained
                                    twenty-one years of age, and I have reason to believe, from
                                    other information besides that of my looking-glass, that I am
                                    very handsome. Nor am I without the accomplishments that proceed
                                    from a fashionable education. But I am still unmarried, and,
                                    what is worse, without any immediate prospect of quitting my
                                    uncheery condition. Nor can I attribute the misfortune, for such
                                    I frankly consider it, to any other cause, but that confounded
                                    thing called money. I am not, indeed, at present without what
                                    are esteemed the comforts, as well as many of the pleasures of
                                    life; for I live with a good-humoured, cheerful, kind-hearted
                                    dowager of an aunt, who enjoys a very handsome jointure: but
                                    such is her hospitable and benevolent disposition, that she
                                    lives up to the full extent of it, so that I have little to
                                    expect from her; and whenever it shall please heaven to take her
                                    to itself, and the spasms with which she is affected are, at
                                    times, very alarming, I shall be left with no more than the
                                    paltry sum of fifteen hundred pounds. In that case, if a husband
                                    to my mind does not come, in the mean time, to my preservation,
                                    I shall have no alternative, but to retire into some cheap,
                                    distant part of the kingdom, to board in a farm-house, or,
                                    perhaps, to marry a country parson; and like those flowers which
                                    are born to blush unseen, I, too, may waste my sweetness on the
                                    desert air. </span></p>
                        <p><span class="letter">It is not that I am destitute of admiration or
                                    attentions; I have, on the contrary, no small portion of them
                                    such as they are, but they are very different from those which
                                    are paid to the vulgar minxes, who have ten thousand pounds in
                                    their pockets. I have overheard it said, What a fine girl that
                                    is! but what a pity also it is that she has no fortune!--If
                                          <span class="persName">Arabella Languish</span> had ten
                                    thousand pounds, says another, I would marry her
                                    to-morrow.--Faith! exclaims a third, I am absolutely in love
                                    with that charming young woman; but I am not equal to living in
                                    a cottage, though she were the mistress of it; or to be
                                    contented with roasted apples and saw-dusty, though she dressed
                                    the dinner. Nay, it was but last week, that a diminutive figure
                                    of an heiress, not four feet high, with a nose half as long as
                                    herself, a pair of eyes that looked in all directions, the
                                    complexion of a Portuguese, and a mouth wide enough to admit of
                                    her jumping down her own throat, said to me in a very sarcastic
                                    tone--"You are, my dear, it must be confessed, a tall, fine
                                    figure, but when I stand upon my father’s title-deeds, I
                                    completely overlook you." I was fool enough to be piqued, and to
                                    tell her, that though in that case she might look over me, all
                                    her father's title-deeds, ten times told, would not purchase her
                                    the power to look like me; and thus our conversation and
                                    acquaintance ended. </span></p>
                        <p><span class="letter">Nor is this all. The son of an attorney who
                                    transacts business for my aunt, thought proper to be continually
                                    repeating such warm declarations in my favour, as to alarm his
                                    father, who forbade him to speak to me, and threatened to turn
                                    him out of doors if he married me. I did not hesitate, however,

                                    marriage; but they add to my humiliation. An officer in a
                                    marching regiment, quartered in a neighbouring town, chose to
                                    become so deeply enamoured of me, as to write me a proposal of
                                    marriage to the following effect.--After declaring the violence
                                    of his passion through four sides and a half of foolscap paper,
                                    and assuring me that, if he were commander-in-chief, he would
                                    lay his heart and all his power at my feet, he very candidly
                                    informed me that all he possessed in the world was his pay,
                                    which amounted to no more than ten shillings a day; at the same
                                    time, he added, that he had the expectation of getting the
                                    ,majority of his regiment, and that my fortune would enable him
                                    to purchase the lieutenant-coloneley: that they were, he must
                                    own, ordered to <span class="placeName">Nova Scotia</span>; at
                                    which place, however, when he had obtained the expected rank, he
                                    should be a person of considerable consequence. He acknowledged,
                                    indeed, that it was a cold, ungenial climate; but he had no
                                    doubt that we should be able to soften all its rigours by the
                                    warmth of our mutual affection. </span></p>

                                    of a sea voyage, which the crown of the <span class="placeName"

                                    his life, as I could not doubt he was most heroically prepared

                                    perhaps, who would be charitable enough to do it for me.

                                    impudence, who, during the summer, exerts his professional
                                    talents in a provincial progress, and was employed to paint my
                                    aunt's picture, felt himself encouraged, by the abominable state
                                    of my finances, to venture on making a matrimonial proposition
                                    to me. He said, it had long been his determination never to
                                    marry any woman who would not serve him as a model to paint
                                    after; and that I possessed the beauty of countenance, the
                                    perfection of for, and the graces of attitude, which precisely
                                    placed me in that predicament. It would have been a folly to
                                    abuse the silly fellow; and, therefore, I replied, with apparent
                                    good humour, that as these qualities of mine were at best no
                                    made to last, and as accidents of various kinds might shorten
                                    their natural duration, I might, perchance, very shortly lose
                                    that usefulness on which he appeared to found a regard, which
                                    would vanish with it. Such a state of trembling apprehension, I
                                    begged leave to decline; and as his affection seemed to be so
                                    very mechanical, I recommended him to direct his attachment to a
                                    lay-figure, which would remain the same to the end of his life.

                                    matrimonial inclinations; nay, were it not for the very

                                    be destined to that most cheerless and disgraceful of all
                                    conditions, exclusive of vice and crime, -- a compulsory state
