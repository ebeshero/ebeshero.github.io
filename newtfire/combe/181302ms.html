         <p><span>The word <span class="emph">curiosity</span>, as applied to an object, cannot fail
               to excite an agreeable sensation, as it suggests the desire or expectation of
               receiving satisfaction or improvement. Thus the <span class="emph">curiosities</span>
               of the <span class="placeName">Tower</span>, or <span class="placeName">Westminster
                  Abbey</span>, or <span class="placeName">Salmon’s Wax-Work</span>, or <span
                  class="placeName">Bullock’s Museum</span>, offer to different ages and characters
               a pleasing and useful source of information. But when we apply this self-same word to
               a disposition of the mind, we do not always feel a similar sensation; and, perhaps,
               among all the troublesome neighbours with which a quiet, studious, inoffensive man
               may be pestered, <span class="emph">curiosity</span> is the most disagreeable; and
               though it cannot be classed among the defined catalogue of human vices, its
               operations are sometimes attended with the most malignant and even fatal
               consequences. I shall not enter into the examination of those causes which have so
               generally led to the opinion, that this principle of curiosity, when considered as a
               failing, is unreservedly applied to the lovely sex. But so it appears to be; and with
               all my regard for those ornaments of creation called women, and indebted as I am for
               the chief happiness of my life to one of them, I cannot altogether deny, that there
               is something more than plausibility in the imputation. I shall not enter into
               distinctions that may appear invidious or illiberal; but the fact is, that when we
               speak of a <span class="emph">man of curiosity</span>, and a <span class="emph">woman
                  of curiosity</span>, two very opposite characters are generally understood. It
               marks a spirit of scientific research and enquiry in the one sex; while, I fear, it
               describes in the other an anxiety to pry into affairs in which they have no allowable
               concern themselves. But to proceed a little further on this interesting, but tender
               topic: there is a similar difference in the terms, a <span class="emph"
                  >curious</span> man and a <span class="emph">curious</span> woman. The former
               excites the idea of a person distinguished by some odd peculiarities of character or
               conduct; while the latter adds nothing to, or diminishes nothing from, the female
               disposition to which I have already ventured to allude. </span></p>
         <p><span>The account which the following letter contains, in much simplicity of narrative,
               and no common testimony of facts in its support, appears to confirm my introductory
               observations; and I cannot deny the reasonableness of the complaints which accompany
               it: at the same time, I am fully prepared to receive from any of my fair
               correspondents such arguments against my present opinion, as their cultivated minds
               and fascinating pens may be pleased to produce; and shall consider a conviction of my
               error, under the influence of their reasoning, as an improvement of my understanding,
               and consequently as an addition to the happiness of my life. </span></p>
         <div class="letter">
            <p><span class="letter">TO THE MODERN SPECTATOR. SIR, </span></p>
            <p><span class="letter">I am a gentleman of studious character, scientific pursuits, and
                  independent fortune. My residence is in a narrow street, in a retired part of the
                  town, which I preferred from the circumstance of a large house and handsome
                  gardens, and some other conveniences suited to my favourite occupations, which the
                  more fashionable districts could not afford me.—But I hasten to the subject of my
                  complaint, and the cause of this intrusion upon you. </span></p>
            <p><span class="letter">I have already observed, that the street where I have taken up
                  my residence, and propose to pass some years of my life, is narrow. Indeed, so
                  limited is the breadth of it, that it is no difficult matter for any of its
                  inhabitants, if they should be so disposed, to make themselves acquainted with the
                  concerns of their opposite neighbors. </span></p>
            <p><span class="letter">This leading point being settled, I must beg leave to inform
                  you, that the family who occupy the house immediately opposite to mine, seem to
                  have little or no employment, but in watching my door, and peeping into the
                  several rooms of my house which front the street. This they do with a regularity
                  and a perseverance sufficient almost to justify a suspicion, that some real and
                  most essential benefit was derived to them from their unremitting vigilance.
                  Indeed, they carry their curiosity to such an extraordinary degree of minuteness,
                  that they are not merely content with flying to their windows whenever there is a
                  rap at my door; but, as my laundry is at the top of the house, they will mount to
                  their garrets to examine the periodical occupations of it. But before I proceed to
                  give a more particular detail of their proceedings, I shall endeavour to present
                  you with an account of the parties from whom they originate. </span></p>
            <p><span class="letter">This family consists of Mr., Mrs., and the two Miss <span
                     class="persName"><span class="emph">Quicksights</span></span>; an old and a
                  young female servant, with a little smart girl of about ten years of age, who is
                  said to be the grandchild of the elderly domestic; a circumstance on which I shall
                  make no other observation, but that none of the neighbours believe it, and that
                  the milkman who serves both families, has figuratively declared to my wife’s <span
                     class="emph">femme de chambre</span>, a very chattering kind of body, that the
                  girl is as like the eldest miss as two drops of cream. But this by the way.
               </span></p>
            <p><span class="letter"><span class="persName">Mr. Quicksight</span> is an elderly man,
                  of a very decent appearance; his good lady seems to be at least as old as himself,
                  but dresses rather smart for her time of life. The two <span class="persName">Miss
                     Quicksights</span> have little to boast as to figure or beauty, but they are
                  very attentive to the changes of fashion, and constantly appear in all cuts and
                  colours of it. Our <span class="persName">Kitty Pry</span>, whom I have already
                  mentioned, and who will sometimes tell a bit of news of our neighbours, in spite
                  of the continual prohibitions of her mistress, positively asserts, that they make
                  all their dresses themselves, which I think is much to their honour, though
                  probably they may not be of the same opinion; but however that may be, they never
                  fail to be the smartest figures in the chapel which we frequent, and from whose
                  morning duties they never absent themselves. </span></p>
            <p><span class="letter">The father of this family is seldom at home; he goes out soon
                  after breakfast, and seldom returns till the hour of dinner; and within an hour
                  after his meal, he issues forth again, rather better dressed, as it may be
                  supposed, to some evening club or coffee-house. They sometimes have company, and
                  whenever that is the case, their windows are thrown open to let the neighbors see
                  the preparations that they are making, and the quantity of plate that is brought
                  forth on the occasion, and in no common abundance. <span class="persName">Kitty
                     Pry</span> says, that <span class="persName">Mr. Quicksight</span> has been a
                  silversmith, and that this display is the remains of his stock in trade. She also
                  has been informed, that at these entertainments a journeyman watchmaker officiates
                  as a servant out of livery. This talkative minx has also another pretty little
                  opinion, which is, that this poor man must be glad to get out of his house, as she
                  is sure he has a terrible life among them; for that on Sundays they stuff out his
                  pockets with their prayer-books, and, if it looks like rain, they send him forward
                  with all their umbrellas. </span></p>
            <p><span class="letter">As for the ladies, against whom I have to make my complaint,
                  their principal employment seems to be that of watching every circumstance without
                  my house, and, as far as their penetrating eyes can reach, every thing that passes
                  within it. If my door is saluted with a single rap, it is a summons for one or
                  other of them to come to the window; but if the signal should be of a more
                  gentlemanly sound, then the two misses never fail to appear; and if a coach should
                  stop, then the mother is sure to be of the party. It was but yesterday that I
                  happened to be at the window, when the carriage of a noble lord who sometimes does
                  me the honour of a visit, stopped at my door, with a notification at it that
                  thundered throughout the neighbourhood: This important event happened at the
                  moment when the Quicksights were at dinner; and the whole family instantly
                  appeared at the windows, and, as it seemed, in such haste, that they came with
                  their mouths full of meat; so that they continued, father, and mother, and misses,
                  looking with all their eyes, and chewing with all their jaws, at least till the
                  arrival of my visitor drew my attention to a better object. It might be almost
                  supposed that a kind of sympathetic impulse existed between the knocker of my door
                  and the heads of the opposite neighbours of mine. But this curiosity never gave me
                  any concern; my wife, who is a woman of superior understanding, used sometimes to
                  pity the folly of it; and we never considered this idle attention to our concerns
                  with the least sense of displeasure, till, from a particular circumstance, I began
                  to suspect, and some subsequent, as well as very peculiar information convinced
                  me, that an envious malignity was blended with their over curious attention to us.
               </span></p>
            <p><span class="letter">It has long been a practice with me to give an handsome dinner
                  every Sunday to my literary friends, and I seldom have less than a dozen persons
                  of learning and science at my table on that day: but as my invitations are not
                  particularly addressed to men of fashion and fortune, but to those who are
                  distinguished by intellectual eminence; and as it too frequently happens, that
                  such persons are not so much the favourites of Plutus as they are of Apollo, and
                  not so attentive to exterior appearance as to interior attainments, my visitors
                  are sometimes, in their figure and fashion, not exactly suited to the fancy of
                  young ladies, who judge of a man from the cut of his pantaloons. </span></p>
            <p><span class="letter">Sunday, therefore, was a day of great curiosity to the <span
                     class="persName">Quicksight</span> family; and as my company arrive, they make
                  their observations, let loose their shoutings, and indulge their laughter, in a
                  way that is not only unpolite, but actually illiberal and indecent. One of my
                  particular friends, whom I see frequently, and can never see too often, at my
                  weekly table, is unfortunately very deformed; but those who know him, lose all
                  sense of the imperfection of his figure in the perfections of his mind. It came to
                  my knowledge, very accidentally, that in the last spring, when these misses had
                  thrown open their windows for a more complete indulgence of their reigning
                  propensity, they offered their insults, and indulged their mockery, on this
                  excellent man’s unhappy shape, with so little reserve, that it must have reached
                  his ears, as it did those of every casual passenger. He probably pitied their
                  folly, and forgot it; for it was not from him that I received the intimation of
                  such unfeeling ribaldry. </span></p>
            <p><span class="letter">I was not without a sense of resentment at this abominable
                  conduct, but I thought that a complaint to the offending parties would rather
                  gratify their malignity than remedy the evil, so I let it pass on and continue
                  without any apparent attention from me. My life, I thank Heaven, is too happy to
                  be disturbed, and my pursuits too important to be interrupted, by such ignorant
                  vagaries. I have, however, lately discovered, that these idle, silly, vulgar
                  people, not only watch every action of me and my family, count and observe upon
                  every person who comes to my door, but that they make regular minutes of every
                  thing they see, in a daily register, and accompany these curious items with such
                  observations as may be suggested by their low minds, uncultivated understandings,
                  and envious dispositions. </span></p>
            <p><span class="letter">It so happened that my baker, who also serves the <span
                     class="persName">Quicksights</span> in that necessary capacity, received a cake
                  from the little girl in that family, with orders to bake it with great care. It
                  was closely covered with a sheet of paper, and the baker happened to see my name
                  upon it, shewed it to my cook, whose curiosity induced her, very unceremoniously,
                  to strip the <span class="emph">gateau</span> of its clothing, and hurry into the
                  kitchen; where its contents underwent, I need not say, a very severe examination;
                  for it was discovered, that the servants were treated with as little reserve as
                  their master and mistress. This paper proved to be a loose sheet of the <span
                     class="emph">Quicksight Diary</span>, which had thus accidentally come into the
                  possession of the very persons who were certainly not intended to have been
                  favoured with the perusal of it. </span></p>

                  curtains. The pot-boy at the Dragon says, it is Bonham’s sister, arrived from
                     <span class="placeName">Yorkshire</span>: but I will not believe it; brothers
                  don’t kiss sisters in that way. </span></p>

                  people may be satisfied with a good dinner once a week, so that they ride in their

            <p><span class="letter">I shall trouble you, <span class="persName">Mr.
                  Spectator</span>, with no more of this curious manuscript. But, without suffering
                  my comforts to be affected by such ignorant and worthless people, I cannot help
                  considering their conduct as a nuisance, which ought to be removed. Now, as there
                  is no method of presenting them by a grand jury, suffer me to present them in this

            <p><span class="byline">I cannot, <span class="persName">Mr. Spectator</span>, resist
                  calling your further attention to a circumstance which took place within a couple
                  of hours after I had written the rough draft of the foregoing letter. </span></p>
            <p><span class="byline">Being in my laboratory, pursuing some chemical experiments, a
                  smart young man was introduced to me on the part of the <span class="persName"
                     >Quicksights</span>. He stated, that he lately made acquaintance with that
                  respectable family, and had a very tender interest in the happiness and honour of
                  the young ladies, by one of whom he was received as a lover; and that she had been
                  very much insulted and distressed by one of my servants, who, from one of the
                  upper windows in my house, had exposed a part of himself which ought to be kicked
                  as long as a foot could be found to kick it. In short, he came to inform me, that
                  he was an attorney, and had received instructions from <span class="persName">Mr.
                     Quicksight</span> to proceed against me. I knew nothing of what had happened,
                  and assured him, it was without my approbation or connivance; at the same time, I
                  did not hesitate to observe, that the continual gazing and inquisitive faces of
                  the <span class="persName">Quicksight</span> family from every window in their
                  house, was equally unpleasant to me; I also added, that it would be a curious
                  question for a court of law to determine—what parts of the human body it was
                  illegal to expose from a window, as eyes might be as offensive as any other
                  portion of it. He said, he loved <span class="persName">Miss Wilhelmina
                     Quicksight</span>, and would not suffer her to be insulted while he had power
                  to take out a writ in her defense. I observed, that he certainly proved himself a
                  very fond and generous lover, as the first present he made to the lady and her
                  family, was that which he most valued himself, a litigious and expensive suit at
                  law. My gentleman was now beginning to be impertinent, when, as I was about my
                  chemical process, by which I could, without any danger, cause a considerable
                  explosion, I immediately produced a very serious bounce; when the attorney
                  instantly burst out of the room, darted through the street door, overturned a
                  baker’s basket into the dirt, tumbled himself into the kennel, and sought, amidst
                  filth and fear, the condolence and cleansing attention of <span class="persName"
                     >Miss Wilhelmina Quicksight</span>. Of the threatened prosecution I have heard
                  nothing, but I understand that the baker has summoned the attorney to the court of
                  conscience for the injury done to his bread. </span></p>
