         <p>LETTER V.</p>
         <p><span class="letter"><span class="opener"><span class="emph">My dear and honoured
                     mother</span>, </span></span></p>
         <p><span class="letter">I SHALL not attempt to answer your kind and truly maternal letter
               in any other way, than by returning you the most grateful acknowledgements of my
               heart, for the additional proof of your ever watchful care and goodness. I do not
               presume to reason on its contents; but shall employ it as the subject of my continual
               study and reflection, and consider it as a lesson for my instruction--as a rule for
               my conduct. I trust you will never write to me in vain; and that not a sentence which
               proceeds from your lips or your pen, will ever fail of having its due influence on
               the understanding and the heart of your Amelia. </span></p>
         <p><span class="letter">The principal feature of my public life, for so I think I may
               correctly name it, since you last heard from me, has been at an entertainment in the
               city; which equally surprised me, for its magnificence, its splendour, and, which I
               did not altogether expect, from its novelty. For though I am well aware of the potent
               effects of education, and the habits of early life, I could not have supposed it
               possible, that such a marked and extraordinary difference could have prevailed in the
               manners of the two great divisions of the metropolis: whereas they now appear to me
               as forming two distinct countries, whose dissimilarity is so decided, that, in my
               visit to the city, I felt myself, as it were, in a new world, or at least in another
               country. I must except indeed the article of dress, for the genius of fashion, which
               presides over the departments of millinery and dress-making, seems to predominate
               with equal expence, parade, and even taste, on one side of the Temple-bar, as on the
               other. But you will say the language must be the same. That it is English I most
               readily allow, and perfectly intelligible I assure you, and possessed all the energy
               of the vulgar tongue. Every word I heard spoken in the circle of which I formed a
               part, is, I doubt not, to be found in the dictionary; but these self-same words were
               so combined, and delivered with such concomitant tones, that they formed a dialet
               with which I happened to be totally unacquainted. And as to manners, there certainly
               must be a kind of instinctive habit of imitation among a certain class of citizens,
               or a settled code of decrums by which their behaviour is regulated, as they bore so
               strong a resemblance to each other. </span></p>
         <p><span class="letter">But to the history of my adventures.--The fond determination of my
               dear aunt, that I should see every thing which this great metropolis affords, in the
               way of amusement, during the period of my residence in it, had induced her to procure
               tickets of admission to an entertainment at the Mansion-house of the lord mayor; and
               Mrs. B<span class="longdash">-----</span>, whose life is passed in the crowds, kindly
               undertook to <span class="emph">chaprone</span> me on the occasion. I understood we
               were to encounter a bustle; and I prepared myself in every respect for the situation:
               but in such a bustle I hope never to engage again; though, as I came safe and sound
               out of it, I am not sorry that I have, for once in my life, been a witness of all the
               curious occurrences connected with it. I had been in the midst of more than one
               squeeze during the winter; and I, therefore, arrayed myself in full preparation for
               another. But to proceed. </span></p>
         <p><span class="letter">On our arrival at the Mansion-house, the master of the ceremonies,
               a smart little man, in a black gown covered with tassels, took Mrs. B<span
                  class="longdash">-----</span>'s hand, and led her through a crowded room to
               present her to the lady mayoress, who was a tall, stout, well-looking woman, of about
               forty. She was very superbly dressed, and sat in a crimson velvet chair, on somewhat
               of an elevated position. She honoured us with a gracious smile, and said nothing; we
               curtsied very low, and did the same. At a small distance from her were two empty
               chairs, and Mrs. B<span class="longdash">-----</span> thought we might as well occupy
               them as any other, which we accordingly did. But we had invaded, as it seemed, the
                  <span class="emph">sanctum sanctorum</span> of the aldermen's ladies; for two of
               those dames, in all the pride and plumage of their character, told us, without the
               least reserve, that we must resign our situations. One of them said to Mrs. B<span
                  class="longdash">-----</span>, "You have got my place, ma'am, and must move:" when
               the other said as coolly to me, "And you must do the same." We obeyed without
               hesitation; and, surprised as I was, I nevertheless felt a strong disposition to
               indulge a laugh: but as we had been turned out of our seats for one indecorum, I
               apprehended we might be turned out of the room if we committed another; so I kept a
               grave countenance, and we mingled with the crowd. In a short time, however, the lord
               mayor appeared in a gown covered with gold, and its train borne, and preceded by a
               man bearing a sword. The aldermen followed in red gowns: and after the lord mayor had
               shaken the lady mayoress by the hand, he turned short round, and strutted off in the
               same ceremony as he came. The lady mayoress followed, conducted by the master of the
               ceremonies; and each of the aldermen taking his lady, the procession moved forwards
               to the dinner. We fell in with the crowd, and such a scene ensued as beggars all
               description. In the Hanover-square squeeze we were immovably jammed, and submitted,
               with all possible good humour, to our situation: but here there was room enough to
               move; and the contest, which was a most unceremonious one, was who should get first;
               and we were driven, and without a word of apology, to right and left, by elbows as
               red as the aldermen's gowns. Nothing, therefore, was left for us but to defend
               ourselves against all this pummeling as well as we could, and to move onward with
               this turbid stream, which at length forced its way, and us along with it, through a
               vast portal, into the Egyptian hall, a most magnificent room, where there was a
               sumptuous banquet, as I understood, for four hundred guests, and such a display of
               ornamental confectionary as I had never seen. Here, as the company entered, they all
               set a running to get places; so we did the same, and were fortunate enough to obtain
               them. A vast band in the gallery continued playing "God save the King" for some time;
               when silence being proclaimed, grace was pronounced, and eating began; and from the
               voracity, both male and female, with which it proceeded, it might be supposed that
               the good people, within my observation at least, had fasted for eight-and-forty
               hours. I unfortunately had placed myself opposite to a turbot; and a jolly dame, on
               the other side of the table, rose up, and she said, to see if there was no fish, when
               the turbot caught her eye, and she instantly vociferated, "I should be glad if the
               lady in a pink cap and a white feather would fill me a plate of what's before her."
               Now this cap-and-feather lady was your poor dear Amelia: I therefore obeyed her
               commands most amply. "And now, miss, some lobster sauce." I accordingly gave her a
               small ladle-full; on which she exclaimed--"Don't be afraid, miss, a little more, if
               you please; miss, don't spare, there's plenty of everything here." So I quadrupled
               her portion, and she added, "Thank you, miss." A rosy-faced man, who sat next her,
               and who eat and talked at the same time, very shrewdly observed, that she did not
               know whether the lady was a miss or not: on which she desired him, in a very snappish
               tone, to hold his foolish tongue. But such an injunction the good man was not, just
               at this time, disposed to obey: so filling a glass of wine, and happening to catch my
               eye, he said, with as significant a look as his feathers were capable of assuming, "I
               do not know, ma'am, whether you are a miss or a mistress; but if you are a miss,
               you'll excuse my freedom, here's wishing you may be a mistress before this time
               twelvemonth." I really could not help feeling confused at the man's impertinent
               ignorance; and had scarcely recovered myself sufficiently to look about me, when a
               man, of rather a genteel appearance, looking directly to me, made an inclination,
               which I, of course, returned, when he instantly cried out, "No, no, it was not you I
               meant, but the young lady next you:" and he then repeated the compliment with a
               familiar nod to her. I really began to feel uncomfortable, while Mrs. B<span
                  class="longdash">-----</span> quite enjoyed it, and laughed <span class="emph">a
                  la folie</span>. But I soon had my revenge; for now my health was actually drank,
               and the civil man, looking towards Mrs. B<span class="longdash">-----</span>, added,
               "Your mamma's health, miss." Now you must know, that though Mrs. B<span
                  class="longdash">-----</span> us a most amiable, pleasing woman, and would have no
               objection to be considered as my sister, she would rather be spared the honour of
               being taken for my mother. She accordingly coloured as red as my cap, and words,
               "vulgar, undiscerning brute!" escaped her in a tone which marked more mortification
               than such a circumstance, I think, should have occasioned. </span></p>
         <p><span class="letter">I was now attacked by a pert, squat young lady, of about thirty, as
               I should think, who sat to the left of me; and who, without a single syllable of
               introduction, asked me if my necklace was mock or real pearl. I told her that I had
               always understood it to be the latter. <span class="longdash">-----</span> "And,
               pray, have you bracelets of the same?" when I drew off my glove, and let her see that
               the decorations of my arms were of the same kind. "You must know," said she, "that my
               papa deals in these things; and we have just such a suit of pearls as these in our
               shop, which he says would not sell for less than five hundred pounds." She then
               actually seized my arm, and examined it, with its <span class="emph"
                  >bijoulerie</span>, as if it were an article in that very shop to which she
               belongs. But as, according to her notions, any one who wears a suit of pearls worth
               five hundred pounds, must be a person of consequence, she began to treat me as such;
               and after she had fished out the place of my residence, she began to mend her
               manners, and became very communicative: she not only explained the ceremonies of the
               feast, which were wholly unintelligible to me, but gave me a very amusing history of
               the company about us; and with a part of it, my dearest mother, I hope to amuse you.
            </span></p>
         <p><span class="letter">"The jolly woman," said she, "whom you helped to the turbot, is the
               wife of a tinman; and the saucy fellow who was so familiar with you, is her husband.
               He serves the lord mayor with the fine illumination around us, and has the pleasure
               of stuffing, as you see him, by the light of his own lamps. She with the sky-blue
               feather, is the widow of a linen-draper, who left her fifteen thousand pounds and a
               country-house; he was one of the volunteers, and died in consequence of a fever he
               caught from over-exercise in a sham-fight. She has been out of her weeds about a
               month, and there are many candidates for her favour, or rather for her fortune. Her
               late husband was a very plain man; and she now says, if she marries again, she'll
               please her eye, though she plagues her heart. The fat girl who sits next to her is
               the daughter of a weight and scale maker; and if she were to get into one of her
               father's scales, he must furnish plenty of weights to make the other sink. As for
               that lady who is now looking through a quizzing-glass, and is so elegantly dressed,
               she can very well afford it: she is the wife of a lottery-office keeper. They are
               people that get a deal of money; for let who will have the blanks, the lottery is
               sure to turn up a prize to them. Do stretch forward a little, and look at that nice,
               neat, prim, precise figure, who sits next but one to me: her husband is a bookseller
               in Paternoster-row; and she may be truly said, I think, to be in print. The two
               pretty girls who are dressed both alike, are the daughters of a drum-maker, who is
               making a fortune out of the war: he drinks Bonaparte's health every night, the last
               thing he does before he goes to bed. They are very amiable young women, and
               particular friends of mine; but their tongues never lie still: and when they are in
               high spirits, a score of their father's drums would be scarce sufficient to silence
               them. The gentleman whom you mistook about drinking my health, is, you must know, an
               admirer of mine; he is a glover, in a very good way of business, who buried his wife
               about two years ago. But the last time I was at the debating society, it was proved,
               to my satisfaction, that a man can never be really and truly in love more than once:
               I am determined, therefore, not to marry a widower." </span></p>
         <p><span class="letter">Thus was she proceeding, and as you must perceive, with no common
               share of sarcastic vivacity, when proclamation was made for silence, and the lord
               mayor rose to deliver a speech which brought my astonishment to its climax. He rose,
               he said (I give his precise words), to drink the healths of the company who had
               honoured him with their presence, and to express his cordial thanks for their having
               comported themselves in such a decent and orderly manner. He then drank his wine;
               and, to complete the whole, the band struck up Handel's <span class="emph">Water
                  Music</span>. </span></p>
         <p><span class="letter">I ventured to ask my neighbour if such speeches were usual. Not
               such as this, she said; but she supposed the chief magistrate, who is a worthy,
               well-meaning, but very uneducated man, had failed in employing suitable expressions:
               for, as she observed, aptly enough, a stranger must be led to imagine that it was
               customary for the company, on these occasions, to break the lamps, destroy the
               chandeliers, and throw the glasses over their heads; and that his lordship thought it
               right to thank his guests for having spared them: at the same time, she begged leave
               to assure me, that no other spirit of destruction prevailed at these festivities,
               than such as may be gratified by knives, forks, and spoons. <span class="longdash"
                  >-----</span> Here our conversation ended, when she presented me with her address
               in the form of a shopcard; entreated me to do her the honour of calling upon her when
               I should come into the city; and, at the same time, informed me, if I wanted any
               thing in her papa's line, no one would do me greater justice: and, one of these days,
               I will most assuredly indulge the freak, and become one of her papa's customers.
            </span></p>
         <p><span class="letter">The banquet was concluded; and of the retiring cavalcade, who
               should form a part but my dear Lady C.; who, seeing us among the crowd, desired one
               of the aldermen to rescue us from it; which he instantly did, with the utmost
               politeness and attention. We now accompanied the procession, and were admitted into
               the lady mayoress's circle. The ball began about ten, when I danced a minuet with an
               alderman--and, with that self-same alderman, attempted to go down a country-dance;
               but it would have been equally possible to have threaded one of our thickest
               beech-woods as to have penetrated the ball-room: it was said that three thousand
               persons were present. <span class="longdash">-----</span> Heat, noise, and confusion
               of every kind, continued till about two in the morning, when the crowd began to
               disperse, and about four we contrived to make our escape. <span class="longdash"
                  >-----</span> Such is the history of a day, which I am not sorry that I have
               passed, but which I shall never wish to repeat. If it should but amuse you, my
               dearest mother, I shall be satisfied. </span></p>
         <p><span class="letter">I remain, with the utmost affection and veneration,</span></p>
         <p><span class="letter"><span class="closer">Your most dutiful daughter, </span></span></p>
