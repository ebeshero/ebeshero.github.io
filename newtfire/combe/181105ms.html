         <p> Marriage, in whatever point of view it may be considered, is one of the most
            interesting subjects to the human mind. It is a state to which every rational, civilized
            being, at one time or other, looks for happiness. Men, indeed, whose situation in
            society is more enlarged, whose occupations are more serious, and whose views are more
            divided, are consequently less attentive to, as they are less anxious respecting
            marriage, than the fairer sex, whose whole regards are directed to that object. It may
            be said to be their being's end and aim. Men are educated according to their various
            ranks and professions: they are instructed to maintain the one, or to pursue the other.
            Matrimony with them is a subsequent consideration, and is not unfrequently a mere
            accidental event, an absolute casualty. Women, on the contrary, are brought up with the
            sole view of being wives. They are taught from the dawn of reason to attain their
            qualifications, as they shape their views to become stationary in the conjugal
            character. But, though the marriage of a woman may arise from sudden and unexpected
            circumstances, an event to which her attention is ever directed, and for which she is
            habitually prepared, let it come when it will, cannot be strictly considered as a matter
            of accident to her. </p>
         <p> The various duties that social man has to perform in the world; the scene of action in
            which he is called, according to his station, to appear; the artificial passions, if I
            may use the expression, which his career will necessarily incite, the enlargement of his
            sphere of life, and the comparative independence of his will, may frequently so engage
            his thoughts, fill up the measure of his gratifications, and satisfy, or at least
            encourage, his leading passion, that his dispositions to the sentiment of love may be
            weakened by their succession, and he may thus be so involved in his worldly projects, as
            not to be in an hurry to make matrimony one of them; while a young woman has no
            interests, enjoys no pleasures, and acquires no graces, but with a direct and decided
            view to the married state. Whatever she does, wherever she goes, with whomsoever she
            lives, the object that plays on her fancy, inspires her wishes, and to which she shapes
            the whole of her conduct, is marriage. This she considers as her natural station, in
            which she looks forward to be fixed, and regards her maiden character in no other light
            than as a state of preparation for it. It was once the condition of her mother, who
            instructs her in its course, and points out the most probable means of exchanging it,
            that she may become a mother in her turn, and repeat the lessons to her daughters. In
            one of our old comedies this notion is pleasantly, as well as naturally, displayed. A
            stiff, maiden aunt is represented as expressing herself in a tone of displeasure to her
            niece, a fine sprightly girl of sixteen, for some little playful irregularity; and, in
            the course of her angry reprehension, she asks her what she thinks she was made for;
            when miss answers, without the least hesitation or reserve, but with sighs and sobbings,
               <span class="emph">that she was made to be married</span>. There are many unmarried
            men, I believe, who have never read the form of solemnizing marriage, at least with
            interest or attention: but does the woman exist, whose marriage is to be produced by it,
            who can read, and has not read it? The answer to this question must meet, I am disposed
            to think, with an universal negative. </p>
         <p> These observations, however, are not made with a design, in any degree, to disparage
            the sex, which are the grace, the delight, and the consolation of human
            existence--Heaven's last, best work; but merely to state the particular condition to
            which they are allotted, as the primary spring of social nature and domestic happiness. </p>
         <p> I was let into this train of thought by the following letter, which I have received
            from a young lady on a subject that naturally suggested it. She appears to possess the
            advantages which are derived from family and fortune; and states her perplexities with a
            frankness and good humour, which will render the account she gives of herself
            interesting to many of my readers, and instructive to some of them. I shall, therefore,
            without any further introduction, present it to their attention: — </p>
         <div class="letter">
            <p><span class="letter">TO THE MODERN SPECTATOR. </span></p>
            <p><span class="letter"> As you invite communications, I shall make no apology for
                  introducing myself in this manner to your acquaintance. That you are a man of
                  understanding, is proved, to my judgment at least, by your introductory essay;
                  while the character you have assumed justifies my considering you as a man of the
                  world. As such you can be of essential service to me in the very awkward,
                  unpleasant, and mortifying situation in which I am involved. I am really anxious
                  to do what is right: my inclinations have no perverseness connected with them;
                  nor, in order to win your opinion to my wishes, shall I attempt to misstate my
                  particular position, or varnish with a false gloss any of the circumstances
                  connected with it. I shall proceed, therefore, to make you acquainted, not only
                  with the dilemma in which I am placed, but the manner in which my mind is affected
                  by it, and the particular inclinations which have arisen out of it. </span></p>
            <p><span class="letter"> When I tell you that my parents are in the first rank of
                  gentry, that I am just nineteen, with a very handsome fortune at my own disposal
                  when I come of age, with other promising contingencies, you will naturally
                  suppose, that the subject on which I am about to consult you, relates, in some way
                  or other, to marriage. It is even so—-and at my age, and in my situation, it is
                  not for me to inform you, that the temple of Hymen is the object which bounds
                  every avenue of my thoughts. Indeed, I cannot very well conceive that any real
                  difficulty should arise in such a situation as mine, which is not more or less
                  influenced by the saffron-robed divinity, whom our sex are brought up from their
                  cradles to worship; and to whose solemnities I have every regular disposition, if
                  I may be allowed to take my own time in the performance of them, proceed in my own
                  way, and chuse my own company when I perform the irrevocable rites. Now, the truth
                  is, that my father wishes to lead me one way, while my mother is anxious to
                  conduct me by another, and there is another which I have rather a strong desire to
                  go myself. 1 will explain my threefold dilemma. </span></p>
            <p><span class="letter"> It is not necessary, I presume, to describe my person or my
                  qualifications. All I shall say on such a subject is, that the one is not, I
                  believe, without some attraction; and the other are the fruits of an education in
                  which no attention or expence was spared to improve a mind, of whose character
                  this letter, perhaps, will enable you to form a tolerable notion. I have already
                  told you that I am of a good family; my connections are in conformity to it, and,
                  on my attaining the age of twenty-one, I shall succeed to a fortune of thirty
                  thousand pounds, which, a marriage with the consent of papa and mamma, will
                  previously give me. Besides this, at the death of the latter a similar sum will
                  devolve to me. Thus you will perceive that I have, at least, all the merits of a
                  good fortune, which may be still increased by several, not very improbable,
                  circumstances; and if my harum-scarum, wrongheaded, high-spirited brother should
                  contrive, in some of his mad pranks, to make a sudden departure from the world,
                  and more unlikely things come to pass every day, I shall be the heiress of six
                  thousand a year. </span></p>
            <p><span class="letter">I need not, I am sure, employ any argument to persuade you,
                     <span class="persName">Mr. Spectator</span>, that I am no common matrimonial
                  object. There is certainly a very heavy, and consequently a very attractive chink
                  in my purse; nor will you suppose that I have reached my nineteenth year, and am
                  still singing, "Nobody comes to woo."-—To tell you the truth, there are at this
                  time two candidates for my good graces. The one is a country neighbour, a young
                  man of large fortune, and a kind of hundredth cousin. He is a good-humoured,
                  chuckle-headed, fox-hunting fellow, who fancies himself violently in love with me,
                  and endeavours to prove the sincerity of his passion by toasting me in bumpers of
                  every kind, and with occasional flashes of complimentary ribaldry, at every club
                  and public meeting in the county. He has done me the honour to name a favourite
                  racing mare after me; and, perhaps, might love me best of all things but his
                  horse. </span></p>
            <p><span class="letter"> My father espouses his cause with great zeal; and my brother,
                  who likes life for the sake of his foxhounds, occasionally lets loose a burst of
                  stable language and university slang in his favour; and, if my mother had joined
                  the party, I should have had not only a difficult, but a very painful business
                  upon my hands: for as to marrying him, no human power should have compelled me to
                  engage in that misery. Fortunately, however, for me, a Scotch lord, a distant
                  relation of my mother, was induced to profess himself my admirer; and he was less
                  suited to my inclinations than my country cousin: but be is warmly supported by my
                  dear mamma. His lordship is very proud, and not very rich; and though he is
                  possessed of a superior understanding, he is so unpleasant in his figure, his
                  manners are so destitute of the winning graces, and he discovers such slender
                  marks of a liberal spirit, that I would rather descend to the repose of the family
                  vault, than accompany him to the altar. It is, however, to these contrasted
                  interests that I am indebted for my present tranquillity: for when my father urges
                  the pretensions of his hero, my mother appears to support my respectful refusal;
                  and when she talks of my being a countess, his prejudice against the whole
                  Scottish nation breaks forth, and saves me from maternal persecution. I have
                  entreated them both, in their secret and distinct communications with me, to leave
                  me to myself till I come of age; and as I have promised my father that I will
                  never marry the Scotch lord, and assured my mother that I will never marry my
                  country cousin, they are each of them respectively persuaded in their own minds of
                  the final success of their particular projects. </span></p>
            <p><span class="letter"> But while these good people were employing themselves so busily
                  in their own ways to get a husband for me, I was not idle, my dear <span
                     class="persName">Mr. Spectator</span>, and had, in a very quiet, unnoticed, and
                  unsuspected way, determined upon one for myself. I am certainly less ambitious
                  than my anxious parents. I have neither chosen a Scotch lord of ancient family,
                  nor a country squire of great estate. My choice (will you believe it?) is nothing
                  more nor less than the parson of the parish, with little more than a living of
                  five hundred pounds a year. He is, however, a young man of very superior
                  attainments, and the grandson of a bishop; while his virtues render him respected
                  and beloved by all who are within the scope of their influence. He travelled with
                  a young nobleman of the first distinction; and a residence of three years on the
                     <span class="placeName">Continent</span> has given as high a polish to his
                  manners as his noble pupil possesses, who is the boast of the first circles.
               </span></p>
            <p><span class="letter">Without the least suspicion of any human being, our future union
                  is settled between us. He undertook to teach me the Italian language, and the
                  perceptor won the heart of his pupil. As no one in the family is acquainted with
                  that tongue, we can exchange our sentiments, without any danger of being detected,
                  or attempting any secret communication, which might create an alarm in the minds
                  of the old folks. The secret is essential to our happiness; for if our future
                  design should be suspected, my father and mother, whose opposite views are so
                  favourable to my own project, finding themselves involved in equal disappointment,
                  would, on the discovery, join in their persecution of me, and my present home
                  would become so painful to me, that I might be compelled to take a step, and in a
                  way, which those whose good opinion I should ever wish to maintain would
                  disapprove. The pride of my mother, and the worldly spirit of my father, would
                  think themselves justified in employing any means, that their thwarted passions
                  might suggest, to prevent the degradation and folly, as they would think it, of my
                  becoming the wife of the parson of the parish, in which my father has four
                  thousand pounds a year. But though I bid defiance to the pride of the one, or the
                  rapacious spirit of the other, I should be glad to avoid a scene of domestic
                  uneasiness; and I certainly deprecate the being disunited from my family. I do
                  not, I trust, deceive myself, when I say, that it is not a fanciful, girlish
                  passion which influences my determination, but a calm, sober, and well-weighed
                  consideration of what will be most conducive to my real happiness. I have had
                  opportunities of observing the scenes of high life and fashionable dissipation,
                  and they do not give even a plausible promise of solid satisfaction. I see also an
                  additional glow on the prospect, when I reflect that I shall elevate the man I
                  love to wealth, instead of receiving the elevation from him. It is not pride that
                  suggests this idea, but affection. </span></p>
            <p><span class="letter">And now for the principal object of my application to you.—-I do
                  not ask your advice whether or no I shall marry the parson, for that I am
                  determined to do; but whether I should take possession of the rectory now, or two
                  years hence, when I shall carry thirty thousand pounds along with me. He seems to
                  prefer the delay; and yet, on Sunday last, at least I fancied so, he seemed to
                  convey the contrary opinion, when he preached from the following text: "Whatsoever
                  thine hand findeth to do, do it with all thy might."—-Your counsel must be
                  disinterested, and I wish to receive it with the reasons on which it is founded.
                  If you should think the measure advisable, I shall not trouble myself about the
                  resentment of papa or mamma; I shall then have a husband to protect me. It is a
                  consideration of no small importance; and though I have plenty of friends to
                  consult, there is not one of them in whom I would venture to confide. I am in a
                  state of great perplexity; and if you will favour me with your advice, I am sure
                  it will be right, and I think I shall follow it. As my father never reads any
                  thing but the Racing Calendar, and my mother confines her studies to novels and
                  the Bible, I am not afraid of their seeing this letter. </span></p>
            <p><span class="closer"><span class="signature">Belinda</span>.</span></p>
         </div>
         <p><span class="byline">There is little or no difficulty in answering this letter: and if
               the reverend divine, with whom <span class="persName">Belinda</span> is over head and
               ears in love, possesses the understanding and the virtues with which her letter
               endows him, he will induce her to follow the advice which I am about to give. I
               cannot suppose that he will encourage an union which must be a clandestine one. The
               reputation of a clergyman requires no common degree of circumspection; and the
               running away to Scotland with the daughter of a wealthy parishioner, will not add to
               his character as a man, or to his influence as a teacher of religion. It will have a
               leading tendency to produce a parochial disunion between the parson and the squire,
               than which nothing can be more detrimental to the morality and good order of a
               country place. There are other circumstances which will render it very prudent for
                  <span class="persName">Belinda</span> to restrain her impatience till the law
               makes her independent of all legal controul; and I seriously recommend her to fill up
               the interval in preparing herself for the condition which she may then chuse to
               adopt. Two years will soon pass away; and will serve to try the reality of her regard
               for the present object of it. Indeed, if more time were generally given to ascertain
               real love from casual passion, the number of wedded penitents would be greatly
               lessened. If, therefore, <span class="persName">Belinda</span> should, at the age of
               twenty-one, retain the sentiments of nineteen, she may then with confidence turn her
               back upon the pleasures and splendour of life in which she has been brought up, and
               look for happiness, with the well-founded hope of obtaining it in the rectory, which
               already possesses her heart; and whither she may then, without a merited reproach
               from any one, convey her fortune.</span></p>
