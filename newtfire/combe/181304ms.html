         <p><span>The passions lead us into error, among other obvious causes, because they fix our
               attention to that particular part of the object which they present to us, blinding
               our eyes, as it were, to every other side of it. A sovereign, passionately ambitious
               of the name of conqueror, forgets not only the miseries that follow his car, but the
               inconstancy of Fortune. He does not reflect, that the real welfare and happiness of
               his subjects are no more than a pretence for his marital frenzy; that pride alone
               forges his arms, and displays his ensigns; while his whole attention is engrossed by
               the expected pomp of future triumphs. Fear, equally powerful with pride, will produce
               the same effect: it will raise ghosts and phantoms; people tombs with the shades of
               those who repose beneath them; and, in the obscurity of the forest, conjure up airy
               forms to affright the traveller; it will sometimes seize on all the faculties of the
               soul, without leaving one of them at liberty to reflect on the absurdity of such
               ridiculous terror. But the passions not only fix the attention on particular sides of
               the objects which they present to us, but they also deceive us, by the fanciful
               appearance of objects which do not exist. It is not uncommon for us to believe, that
               we see in things what we are desirous of finding there. Illusion is the necessary
               effect of the passions, the strength or force of which is generally measured by the
               degree of obscurity into which they lead us. There is no age which has not, by some
               ridiculous effects of belief or incredulity, afforded matter of laughter and mockery
               to those which succeeded it. </span></p>
         <p><span>But of all the passions to which humanity is liable, none has given rise to so
               many superstitions as that of love: so that the wit seems to be almost justified in
               the opinion which he has left upon record, that “to act the part of a lover and to
               play the fool, were one and the same thing.” The other passions of the mid, like
               serpents lodged within, poison, it is true, our best satisfactions; but this, like
               Aaron’s rod, devours them all, and turns them to its own purpose. </span></p>
         <p><span>All ages appear to have resembled each other in the conduct and symbols of this
               passion. The Greeks and Romans made a discovery of their love, by writing upon trees,
               walls, doors, &amp;c. the name of the beloved object: they had no glass windows, or
               they would probably have made them subservient to the display of their amorous
               sentiments. They frequently decked the doors of the houses where their Daphnes and
               Amaryllises resided, with flowers and garlands, sprinkled the door-post with wine,
               and made libations of it on the spot, as the sacrifice of love to beauty; while the
               garland being untied by the fair one to whom it was offered, or the return of a
               similar present, were considered as a certain proof of female acquiescence. They had
               also several methods of discovering whether their passions would prove successful,
               which answer to the application of cards, and other inventions of modern times,
               employed by the young people of our own enlightened age. When their love (I am still
               speaking of the ancient inamoratas) failed of success, they had various arts to
               excite a return of affection in the lovely objects of their passion. They had
               recourse to enchantresses and magical incantations: but the most common means
               employed on these important occasions were, philters and love potions, the operation
               of which was sometimes, not only violent and attended with danger to their lives,
               but, which is worse, was frequently known to deprive such as drank them of their
               reason. The account of the ingredients of which some of them were composed, as
               mentioned by the writers of those times, are so various and extraordinary, that, had
               I space to recount them, they would be found to rival the mixture of Hecate’s
               cauldron, in the tragedy of <span class="emph">Macbeth</span>. </span></p>
         <p><span>But besides these philters, various other arts were employed to excite love, in
               which the application of certain substances was to have a magical influence on the
               person against whom they levelled their skill. A hyaena’s udder, worn under the left
               arm, was supposed to draw the affections of whatever woman they fixed their eyes
               upon. Burning laurel and melting wax were supposed to be capable of exciting the
               flame of love. When one heart was to be hardened, and another to be mollified, clay
               and wax were exposed to the same fire together. Love-knots were supposed to have
               singular power; and the number three was particularly observed in all they said and
               did. These arts branched out into innumerable forms of attraction and inspiration;
               but no good effect was ever expected to result from them, if they were not attended
               with magical verses, and certain formularies of words and actions. </span></p>
         <p><span>Thus it appears that superstition in affairs of love is of very ancient origin;
               and the love-sick girl who goes to the cunning man, or crosses the gipsy’s hand with
               her last sixpence, to know when she shall be married, or the number of children she
               is doomed to have; or, by consulting the cards, discovers her lover in the knave of
               hearts, will find an example in Dido, queen of Carthage, whom Virgil represents as
               going to consult the priest, to have her fortune told respecting the passion she
               entertained for AEneas. </span></p>
         <p><span>I have rather extended my thoughts further than may have been thought necessary
               for my purpose; but the number of Valentines which I received, suggested them to me,
               and as introduction to some very curious information which I at the same time
               received on the amorous sorceries practised by young men and maidens respecting the
               success and failure of their views in the grand object of matrimonial establishment.
               I can only select a few of the very numerous attempts to ascertain the future fate of
               lovers. </span></p>
         <p><span>A young woman, who signs herself <span class="persName"><span class="emph">Mary
                     Hopeful</span></span>, tells me, that, on the eve of last Valentine’s-day, she
               procured five bay leaves, and pinned four of them to the four corners of her pillow,
               and the fifth to the middle, having been informed, by a very sensible old lady, that
               if she dreamed of her sweetheart, they should be married before the year was out. But
               to make sure, she boiled an egg hard, and having taken out the yolk, filled it up
               with salt; she then went to bed, and eat it shell and all, without speaking a word,
               or drinking after it. She adds, that as she dreamed of <span class="persName">Mr.
                  Lump</span>, the grocer, she has no doubt but she shall have the honour to address
               me, within the year, under that title. </span></p>
         <p><span><span class="persName">Deborah Doubtnot</span> informs me, that having slept in a
               strange bed the other night, she tied her garter nine times round the bed-post, and
               knit nine knots in it, and the repeated to herself, </span></p>
         <p><span>This knot I knit, this knot I tie,</span></p>
         <p><span>To see my love as he goes by,</span></p>
         <p><span>In his apparel and array</span></p>
         <p><span>As he walks in every day.</span></p>
         <p><span>She accordingly saw <span class="persName">Mr. Trusty</span> pass by the house as
               she was dressing herself at the window the next morning. She at the same time
               requests me to tell her, as this gentleman was going to the drill, he being one of
               the volunteer association, whether his regimentals may be considered as every day
               clothes. </span></p>
         <p><span><span class="persName">Miss Wishful</span>, however, desires to abuse all these
               foolish notions, as she is sure that they are all absolute nonsense. She was told, it
               seems, when she was in a more credulous temper than she is at present, that if she
               walked backwards without speaking a word into the garden on midsummer eve, and
               gathered a rose, and then kept it in a clean sheet of paper without looking at it,
               till Christmas-day, it would be as fresh as in June; when, if she had stuck it in her
               bosom, her future husband would come and take it. This ceremony she performed with a
               most rigid adherence to every part of it. However, when Christmas-day arrived, and
               with a palpitating heart she opened the paper, nothing appeared but a withered
               flower. She acknowledges that she was so mortified on the occasion, that she should
               not have been able to hold up her head the whole day, if <span class="persName">Mr.
                  Twogood</span>, the mercer, who dined with her papa, had not told her, she was
               like a mince-pie, as it contains the sweets of the four quarters of the globe.
            </span></p>
         <p><span>With another very interesting question I shall conclude my selection from the heap
               of materials which are now before me. </span></p>
         <p><span><span class="persName">Miss Nancy Sharpset</span> desires to know, whether she has
               a right to lie in bed with her eyes shut, on St. Valentine’s morning, till Betty
               comes and tells her that her father’s book-keeper, a very handsome young man, has
               taken his seat in the counting-house. </span></p>
         <p><span>It would puzzle, I believe, the whole Antiquarian Society to trace these strange
               whims and fancies to their proper origin; though they seem to me, in one way or
               other, to be of the most remote antiquity. </span></p>
         <p><span>I shall now proceed to a fair correspondent, of a very different
            character.</span></p>
         <div class="letter">
            <p><span class="letter">TO THE MODERN SPECTATOR. SIR, </span></p>
            <p><span class="letter">I am perfectly aware of the enquiring eye of the world, and the
                  remarks to which a lady subjects herself on addressing a gentleman previous to any
                  personal acquaintance; but however that may be, where intellectual acquirement is
                  the object, it strikes me as a mark of cowardice, not to pursue it. Besides, I
                  have no doubt, if I should hereafter be so fortunate as to be favoured with the
                  knowledge of you, that I shall fully convince you, that a deference to the opinion
                  of the world is most legibly penned in the collection of precepts by which my
                  conduct is governed. Thus much I have thought it necessary to say upon the
                  subject, lest, from your perfect ignorance of myself and character, an idea of
                  frivolity might be excited in your mind respecting me, which, as a first
                  impression, it might hereafter be difficult to efface. </span></p>
            <p><span class="letter">I am a woman, <span class="persName">Mr. Spectator</span>, and
                  you will indulge me, therefore, with a few words about myself; although, as
                  regards vanity, I possess as small a portion of that quality as at any time falls
                  to the share of my sex. As for the voluntary contributions of the intelligent and
                  the polite, one cannot receive them but with certain marks of satisfaction; and
                  the aversion I have conceived to the wounding of another’s feelings, has rendered
                  me a living sacrifice at the shrine of secret suffering. As for the complimentary
                  eulogiums which I received in what may be called fashionable society, I have ever
                  noticed them with as little attention as common civility would allow. </span></p>
            <p><span class="letter">My aunt and I have not long been arrived in town, from a
                  beautiful seat which she possesses in <span class="placeName">Devonshire</span>,
                  where the cooing of the doves, the ba’aing of the lambs, and rippling of the
                  waters, rarely fail to furnish food for conversation; for if, on the perusal of a
                  novel, she meets with a passage descriptive of a lover retiring among the
                  embowering groves, there to meditate and pen a sonnet to the melting languor of
                  his mistress’s eyes, she is instantly enraptured; and, indeed had there not been a
                  large portion of flowery language in one of your admirable papers, I should have
                  had uncommon difficulty in gaining her consent, <span class="emph">car je suis
                     sous sa garde</span>, to address you. Now, <span class="persName">Mr.
                     Spectator</span>, though this turn for romance and provincial seclusion, may be
                  by no means unnatural in a disappointed spinster (for such my dear aunt, the most
                  candid of human beings, acknowledges herself to be), I do not hesitate to avow,
                  that I am not indisposed to look a little into that world in which it may be my
                  lot to pass a portion, at least, of my future life. But my more immediate wish is
                  to become acquainted with some literary man of established reputation; and from
                  the very great pleasure with which I have read your papers, and the instruction I
                  have derived from them in the country, I feel a wish to be improved by your
                  conversation in town. Now I really know not how to contrive an interview, as you
                  may readily believe, without your assistance. Of this you must be the best, as,
                  indeed, you can be the only judge. </span></p>
            <p><span class="letter">I must desire you not to be alarmed lest my aunt should fall in
                  love with you, for she has devoted herself to a state of celibacy, from which she
                  will never depart; and as for myself, I must see you before I will give you leave
                  to fall in love with me. I cannot help having the name which my parents gave me,
                  but I desire you will not entertain an unfavourable impression of me, because I am
                  compelled to subscribe myself, your obliged humble servant, </span></p>
            <p><span><span class="signature">FANNY WAVER</span></span></p>
         </div>
         <p><span>Whether my fair correspondent is serious or jocose; whether she is quizzing me, or
               flattering me, or is seriously disposed to form an acquaintance with me, from any
               favourable impressions which my writings may have been so fortunate as to make on her
               mind, I really cannot determine. Her letter is certainly written with spirit and
               elegance; and the seal of it, if it is her own, tells me, that <span class="persName"
                  >Fanny Waver</span> is of a family and connection that might command any society
               in the kingdom, without having recourse to an anonymous application. I must beg leave
               to inform <span class="persName">Miss Fanny Waver</span>, be she who she may, that I
               should be very ill qualified for the task of instructing others, if I were to be a
               dupe myself. This is not the first time I have had flattering offers made to me; nay,
               I once received a letter, written in a very fair hand, on paper perfumed with musk,
               and whose cypher had a very amorous motto, which desired me to shew myself on the
               south side of <span class="placeName">Gosvenorsquare</span>, precisely at one o’clock
               on the following day, with a white handkerchief in my hand; when I was assured, that,
               if my person proved as charming as my writings, a lady of beauty and fortune would
               make herself known to me, as preparatory to an hymeneal union. But I did not expose
               myself to this inviting chance; and continue contented in my snug little apartment
               next the sky, satisfied with contemplating moral beauty, as it appears in the
               dignified qualities of which our nature is susceptible, and deriving my principal
               happiness from the endeavour to make others happy, by persuading them to be good,.
            </span></p>
         <p><span><span class="persName">Miss Fanny Waver</span> will excuse me, if I delay any
               further attention to her proposal, till she condescends to make me better acquainted
               with the real writer of the letter which contains it. </span></p>
         <p><span>I cannot, however, conclude without a few lines to <span class="persName">Mrs.
                  Deborah Worry</span>, of <span class="placeName">Worry Hall</span>, in the country
               of <span class="placeName">Rutland</span>. This good lady complains most bitterly of
               Valentine’s-day, which she says, for two or three days before, and as many after it,
               turns all the people’s heads in her family. On the morning of this anniversary, she
               can find no one to answer her bell; the servants’ hall, the kitchen, and the stable,
               are always so many different scenes of confusion; either from the emotions of
               triumph, or the feelings of disappointment, the whole house is in an uproar. On the
               last Valentine’s-day, she says, she had scarce set down to breakfast, when the cook
               entered, and begged leave to change the rolls, as those on the table had been brought
               in by mistake, having been intended for <span class="persName">Thomas</span> the
               gardener, and <span class="persName">William</span> the butler, Valentines having
               been put in them when they were dough, and had been baked in the oven. The old lady
               seems to be quite in a fuss about it, and thinks she has narrowly escaped being
               choaked by a Valentine. She accordingly requests me, with great earnestness, to
               employ all the powers of my pen to put an end to an abominable custom, which drives
               every thing out of the heads of the young people at this time of the year, but lovers
               and sweethearting. But with all my disposition to attend to the wishes of my
               correspondents, I cannot bring myself to comply with her’s. On the contrary, I think
               that Valentine’s-day is attended with many advantages. We are all of us indebted for
               every thing we have in this world, to love-making, and therefore we should be very
               ungrateful if we did not employ all honest means to promote it. Valentine’s-day,
               besides, calls forth, in one way or other, the exertion of intellectual powers, in
               every various rank of life; and I once heard a gentleman say, wo was considered as an
               elegant poet, that he probably might never have known his talent for versification,
               if certain impulses of the tender passion had not, at a very early period of his
               life, inspired him to write a Valentine. It also encourages the arts, by rewarding
               the invention of devices for the occasion. It likewise promotes certain branches of
               trade, by the great consumption it occasions of paper, pens, ink, wafers, and
               sealing-wax. And both as a patriot and a man of letters, I cannot but look with
               complacency on a day, which adds, while it lasts, so considerably to the revenues of
               the Post Office. I think, therefore, that <span class="persName">Mrs. Deborah
                  Worry</span> should content herself with taking care that Valentines do not choke
               her in the parlour, and leave them to their natural operations in every other part of
               the house. </span></p>
