         <p><span>The art of overcharging in description, and attracting notice by exaggerated
               representation, as applied to the incitement of public curiosity, has, I think,
               attained the utmost perfection of which it is susceptible. It was formerly, in a
               great degree, confined to the mountebank and the empiric; and the <span class="emph"
                  >panaceas</span> which promised to cure every disease, and remove every infirmity,
               incident to the human frame, alone addressed themselves with any actual perseverance
               to the credulity of the pubic. But now, it is not merely the auctioneer, or the
               dealer in articles of fashion or luxury, who finds the utility of what is called
                  <span class="emph">puffing</span>: men of science, education, and what are called
               the liberal professions; ministers, statesmen, orators, lawyers, and beauties, find a
               puff essential to their various objects and personal importance. It is an age of
               puffing, and every one who is anxious for celebrity, must apply to it, from the
               framer of a treaty to the maker of a blacking-ball; from a duchess, in all the
               splendid attire of a birth-day, to the <span class="emph">Hottentot Venus</span>.
            </span></p>
         <p><span>Now, as I hold this practice to be of national use, by opening a path to genius,
               encouraging invention, and presenting their ever-varying productions, in a pleasing
               way, to public notice; as it has the same efficacy and allurement by its mode of
               employing the press, as a superior mind and elegant fancy give to ordinary
               conversation; as it is little more than decorating truth with those seducing
               exaggerations which render it more attractive, than that display of dress, which, in
               make and material, affords such a heightening charm to beauty; as it is of such
               acknowledged advantage in our commercial country, by enlivening the current of trade,
               and consequently accelerating the circulation of money; as it is often found to aid
               modest merit; and, as without it, </span></p>
         <p><span>So many beauteous flowers would blush unseen,</span></p>
         <p><span>And waste their sweetness on the desert air:</span></p>
         <p><span>“Full many a gem of purest ray serene</span></p>
         <p><span>The dark unfathom'd caves of ocean bear:</span></p>
         <p><span>Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,</span></p>
         <p><span>And waste its sweetness on the desert air.”</span></p>
         <p><span>― Thomas Gray, An Elegy Written In A Country Churchyard</span></p>
         <p><span>any hints, I should presume, for its improvement, or the establishing certain
               principles for a scientific regulation of it, must be of national benefit. I cannot,
               therefore, employ this paper to a more laudable purpose than by inserting an essay on
               the subject, which I found in the portfolio of a very ingenious friend, now no more,
               whose last will and testament gave it to my possession. It is <span class="emph"
                  >verbatim</span>as follows: </span></p>
         <p><span><span class="emph">Instructions for Hair-dressers, Perfumers, and all others whom
                  it may concern.</span></span></p>
         <p><span>It may, perhaps, be thought injudicious in me, to begin with professions that seem
               to have exhausted the art I propose to teach. But I take their beaten track, in order
               to give a more striking exhibition of my skill, and to prove that I am capable of
               creating novelty, where it may naturally enough be considered as next to impossible
               that any novelty could be produced. </span></p>
         <p><span>I shall begin, therefore, by supposing a well-instructed, fashionable
               hair-dresser, &amp;c. to have boiled up, clarified, and scented a large quantity of
               unguent, composed of mutton suet and chicken’s grease, with a small infusion of tar;
               and that it appears upon the shelves of his shop in pots of an elegant form, covered
               with pink or pea-green paper, and adorned with a copper-plate label, supported by
               cupids, with the following inscription in variegated letters:--<span class="emph"
                  >Louis Pomade’s Capillary Crescive</span>. These materials being ready for sale,
               the proprietor must announce it to the public, in all the fashionable newspapers, by
               an advertisement of this description:-- </span></p>
         <p><span><span class="emph">All false Hair at an end</span>. </span></p>
         <p><span>”Whereas it is a very great and lamentable disgrace to the fair and lovely part of
               the creation, Heaven’s last, best work, that they should be so frequently obliged to
               wear wigs, while the gentlemen so very generally wear their own hair: <span
                  class="emph">Louis Pomade</span> begs leave to acquaint all ladies of fashion, as
               well as fashionable gentlemen, whom any accident or illness may have obliged to have
               recourse to the peruke-maker for an imitative covering of hair for that noble and
               capital part of the human frame, called the head, that he is the sole inventor,
               manufacturer, and proprietor of a pomatum called the <span class="emph">Capillary
                  Crescive</span>, which causes such an amazing increase of vegetation in the human
               hair, that, in future, every lady or gentleman, tho’ reduced to an absolute state of
                  <span class="emph">Calvinism</span>, may be assured of possessing, in a very short
               time, a sufficient quantity of hair for all the purposes of fashionable head-dress.
               It is equally useful for the eyebrows,” &amp;c. &amp;c. </span></p>
         <p><span>When this advertisement, strengthened by a diffusive circulation of hand-bills,
               has sufficiently proclaimed this <span class="emph">Capillary Panacea</span>, the
               proprietor must proceed to inform the public of some indisputable examples of its
               astonishing operations. This will be best done by the <span class="emph">puff
                  narrative</span>, which may be to the following purpose: </span></p>
         <p><span>”On Thursday last, as a young lady was crossing the upper part of <span
                  class="placeName">Berkeley-square</span>, a rude gust of wind took the liberty of
               bearing away her bonnet, and left her an object of much unseemly mirth to the vulgar
               passengers. The laugh, however, of the beholders was soon converted into the utmost
               astonishment, when they beheld her tresses, which the loosened ribbon could no longer
               contain, fall down in a graceful flow almost to her knees. The uncommon length,
               beauty, and thickness of the lady’s hair gathered such an immediate crowd about her,
               that she was obliged to take refuge in an adjoining shop, from the troublesome
               curiosity of the beholders: and though the footman who followed her, almost
               immediately recovered her head-dress, it was some time before the patience of the
               crowd was exhausted, who waited to see the <span class="emph">long-haired</span> lady
               make her re-appearance.” </span></p>
         <p><span>The foregoing paragraph must be inserted successively in all the morning, and some
               of the evening papers, and may be immediately succeeded by the following <span
                  class="emph">puff intelligent</span></span></p>
         <p><span>”It is proper to inform the public, that the lady <span class="emph">whose
                  enormous head of hair</span> occasioned so much curiosity in <span
                  class="placeName">Berkeley-square</span>, a few days since, and has created no
               small conversation among the fashionable circles, was, within these eighteen months,
               without a hair on her head, having been obliged to be shaved, in consequence of a
               delirious fever; and surely it ought to be known for the public benefit, that her
               present very extraordinary tresses have proceeded from the application of that
               astonishing pomatum, known by the title of <span class="emph">Louis Pomade’s
                  Capillary Crescive</span>. </span></p>
         <p><span>When this essential intelligence is properly circulated, it may, after some
               interval, be followed up by the <span class="emph">puff precautionary</span> and
                  <span class="emph">puff inventive</span>. </span></p>
         <p><span><span class="emph">Precaution and Proof</span>. </span></p>
         <p><span>”Whereas the waiting-woman of a lady of the first distinction, in consequence of
               her being daily employed in anointing her lady’s hair, every day for about a month,
               with the <span class="emph">Capillary Crescive</span>, has found the palms of her
               hands to be covered with a thin pile, or hair; it is recommended to all persons
               applying this extraordinary unguent, to beware of using it without gloves. At the
               same time, <span class="emph">Louis Pomade</span> begs leave to inform the public,
               that, to remedy this inconvenience, he has invented a particular kind of skin, or
               bladder-glove, some hundred dozen pairs of which are now manufacturing, for the
               purpose of accommodating his customers, and preventing the very unpleasant incident
               that is here related; but which, at the same time, proves the uncommon <span
                  class="emph">crescent</span> powers of his pomatum.” </span></p>
         <p><span>The attention of the public may also be renewed by the following <span
                  class="emph">puff historical</span>. </span></p>
         <p><span>”The celebrated <span class="emph">Capillary Crescive</span> is not the invention
               of its present proprietor, <span class="emph">Louis Pomade</span>, as he pretends, it
               being well known that he received it from a very learned physician and profound
               chemist, as a reward for having saved his life, when the doctor was attacked by
               robbers, within a few leagues of <span class="placeName">Basle, in
               Switzerland</span>.” </span></p>
         <p><span>A few illustrative paragraphs may, from time to time, grace the columns of a
               morning paper to good effect; and I will venture to assert, that a pomatum composed,
               as may be easily done, to do no harm, and to be capable of some good, when
               recommended according to this system, will advance the fortune of any <span
                  class="emph">Louis Pomade</span>, or, <span class="emph">mulatis mutandis</span>,
               any other ingenious artist, who has the good sense to adopt, and the spirit to
               prosecute, such a plan as that which has been proposed. </span></p>
         <p><span><span class="emph">For the Use of young Physicians</span>. </span></p>
         <p><span>For the sake of the instructions I am about to give, I must suppose that a young
               doctor of medicine, qualified at all points for his profession, arrives in town, and
               enters upon the career of medical life. Fortunate circumstances sometimes happen that
               elevate men at once into so high a degree of popular notice, as precludes all
               application to adventitious arts to bring them forward. But my physicians must be
               unfavoured by any of these fortunate aids, and be considered as waiting with an
               honest, but ardent impatience, for the moment when public opinion is to enrol him
               among its favoured objects. </span></p>
         <p><span>It must be his first business, therefore, to let the world know that there is such
               a phycisian in existence as himself; and for this purpose I should advise him to
               publish a book. </span></p>
         <p><span>If he does not possess those inventive talents which may qualify him to strike out
               some ingenious and novel hypothesis, he must take the old track, and give somewhat of
               variety to its progress. His <span class="emph">University Thesis</span> may serve as
               a superstructure, whereon he may build an attractive medical edifice. This may be
               done with some pains, which he will have the leisure to employ, and some study which
               I suppose him amply qualified to pursue. To this work he will prefix his name, with
               its professional additions, and must take care to give it all the advantage of
               copious advertisement. Some sale there may be a right to expect, a few copies may be
               judiciously distributed as from the author, and his publisher will help him, by means
               of fresh titlepages, to new editions whenever he pleases. So that he will gain some
               credit, at least, among those who read little more than advertisements and
               titlepages; and they form no inconsiderable part of the world. His name, therefore,
               will now be generally known as a physician, and he must employ the obvious and ready
               means which the metropolis offers, that he should be personally known as such. His
               medical work should also be dedicated to some person or lady of quality or fashion,
               who may be thereby introduced to recommend or consult the author. At all events, the
               literary patron or patroness will, for the sake of their own credit and consequence,
               speak will of the book, which cannot but answer a beneficial purpose. </span></p>
         <p><span>Thus introduced to the notice of the public, and having acquired a genteel
               personal acquaintance, which may be increased by a summer’s visit to a watering
               place, I shall recommend my medical aspirant, on the first opportunity, to offer
               himself a candidate as a physician to some hospital, infirmary, or dispensary. This
               attempt will tend very much to enlarge his acquaintance; and as I shall suppose his
               manners to be genteel, and his deportment ingratiating, may attach persons to his
               interest. If he has any chance of success, he will naturally stand the issue of an
               election, and the zeal of those who have supported him, if he should fail, may be of
               future service in more ways than one. If his prospect is discouraging, he must
               decline the contest with a good grace, and immediately insert something like the
               following address in all the papers. </span></p>
         <p><span>TO THE GOVERNORS, &amp;c. &amp;c.</span></p>
         <p><span><span class="emph">My Lords, Ladies, and Gentlemen</span>, </span></p>
         <p><span>”If I had been earlier in my application to succeed the late Doctor, &amp;c.
               &amp;c. &amp;c. I have every reason to believe that I should have obtained the object
               of my honest ambition. The regret at pre-engagement which was expressed by many, and
               the good opinion I appeared to possess of those whose favour I solicited on the
               occasion, justify my making such a flattering declaration. But, in the present state
               of the contest, I think it my duty to leave my competitor in the uninterrupted
               prospect of that success, to which your protection will conduct him, and which, I am
               most willing to acknowledge, his merits so well deserve: and flattering myself, that
               on some future occasion, I may retain the good opinion which has been universally
               expressed of me in the course of my solicitation, I have the honour of being,”
               &amp;c. &amp;c.-- </span></p>
         <p><span>Such a public address will continue to advance the object of being known; the
               assertions it contains will be taken for granted by all who read it, and will annex
               an idea of merit, modesty, and liberality to the name which subscribes it; all of
               which will form no trifling preparative to future practice. </span></p>
         <p><span>I shall now presume, that, from his own recommendation, or that of others, the
               sickness r absence of a family physician, or some sudden emergency, our young doctor
               may have been called to some person of rank or fashion. I will also imagine, that as
               persons in that station of life are often sick when nothing ails them, and are
               disposed to take alarm at the most trifling indisposition, the accidental patient may
               be very easily restored to health. This being accomplished, the following <span
                  class="emph">historical intelligence</span> may be inserted among the news of the
               day. </span></p>
         <p><span>”On Saturday evening, Lord or Lady T-----, or Sir George or Lady S-----, or Mr. or
               Mrs. W-----, was suddenly taken ill, to the great alarm of the whole family; but by
               the timely skill of the physician called in on the occasion, we have the very great
               pleasure to inform the public, that he or she is now entirely out of danger.”
            </span></p>
         <p><span>This circumstance being duly circulated, it must be succeeded by the following
                  <span class="emph">illustrative anecdote</span>. </span></p>
         <p><span>”The physician who was so successful in preserving the life of that excellent
               character, &amp;c. &amp;c. when he or she was seized in such an alarming manner on
               Saturday evening last, was not Dr. B-----, who is the family physician, but Dr.
               D-----, of G-----street, who was called in, as Dr. B----- was, at the time, so ill
               himself, as to be confined to his bed.” </span></p>
         <p><span>The book may, at this time, be again announced to the public, and it is not to be
               doubted, but, by taking a ready advantage of circumstances, and applying certain
               attractive literary hints, &amp;c. according to the foregoing instructions, that our
               young doctor will be soon raised above any kind of puffs but those of his own
               patients. </span></p>
