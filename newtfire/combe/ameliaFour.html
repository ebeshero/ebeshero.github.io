         <p>LETTER IV.</p>
         <p><span class="letter"><span class="opener"><span class="emph">My dearest Child</span>,
               </span></span></p>
         <p><span class="letter">YOUR letters are so much what I wish you to write to me, that I
               really believe if I had amused myself with fancifully composing such epistolary
               communications as my anxious heart could wish to receive from you, they could not
               have been more completely framed to fill up the measure of my satisfaction, than
               those which I now behold on the table before me. </span></p>
         <p><span class="letter">My occasional letters, brief as they are, tell you of all
               occasional matters; but when I send you such a packet as this, you will naturally
               look for the well-weighed counsels of a mother, whose whole thoughts are directed to
               an only child and darling daughter, who, by her virtues, qualities, graces, and
               affection (which last is the source of them all), has hitherto most amply rewarded my
               maternal cares; and, by the unremitting discharge of every duty during the sad state
               of debility with which it has pleased God to try me, has been so kind an alleviator
               of my sufferings. </span></p>
         <p><span class="letter">When, my dear Amelia, you left your native woods and your mother's
               arms for a winter in the metropolis, I felt no fear; and when I was wheeled to the
               window to see the carriage depart with you, I enjoyed the most perfect confidence
               that it would bring you back as blameless as you left me; that not one fetid atom of
               the world's corruption would infect your heart, or the slightest stain appear on the
               surface of your demeanour. But my expectations did not rest here. I looked forward to
               your attaining a practical experience of the world, and that you would realize all my
               theories by your own views of life, and apply them to all the modern changes of modes
               and manners. For it is merely the modes and manners that change; the leading motives
               to action are the same at all times and in all periods: the human heart undergoes no
               substantial alteration: it remains unchanged as to its original construction and
               character; and the superiority or inferiority of one period to another, arises from
               no other cause but the comparative proportion of corruption which prevails. It is
               most true, that, when I was young, there was not so great a laxity of manners as
               distinguishes the present age. By your accounts it appears, that you have invitations
               for every night in the week, and sometimes two or three in the same night; while in
               my youthful days, four or five balls in a winter, as many assemblies, an occasional
               play, and twice at the opera, was considered as a very gay winter's routine of
               pleasure for a young woman of rank and fortune: and I have heard my mother say, that
               half that number was scarcely allowed in her day. She was never suffered to dance
               with a gentleman who was not an acquaintance of her family, and who had not presented
               himself some days previous to the ball, to ask a parental permission to have that
               honour; and now the misses dance with men they never spoke to before, and with half a
               dozen of them in the same night, if they can get them. For the alteration in manners
               is more particularly striking to us good folks of a former period, in what seems to
               approach to an abolition of attentions to women; and hence proceeds the prevailing
               familiarity between the sexes, to which I, in a great measure, attribute the frequent
               carelessness of domestic character and violation of domestic honour. </span></p>
         <p><span class="letter">On these subjects, however, my dearest Amelia does not require any
               observations of mine, as she appears to me to be perfectly qualified to make them
               herself, in the most impressive manner, and with the happiest effect. I shall,
               therefore, leave the objects around her to her own reflection, and confine the
               principal part of this letter, which, from the feeble state of my fingers, must be
               the result of successive exertions, to a subject of the utmost importance to young
               minds, and particularly such a mind as her's. I have, accordingly, treated it in that
               serious and argumentative way, which I consider as best calculated to answer the
               design for which it is communicated to her. It is on the <span class="emph"
                  >Imagination</span>--a very principal source of happiness to man, and more
               peculiarly dangerous when unduly indulged by female youth; as, from their appropriate
               situations and circumstances, they are much more liable to be carried away by its
               chimeras than the other sex; who, from the nature of their education, employments,
               and comparative freedom from restraint, are more generally fortified against it. I
               have, however, treated the subject without any immediate application; and I leave it
               to you, my dearest child, as occasion may suggest, to apply it to yourself.
            </span></p>
         <p><span class="letter">It cannot be denied that the <span class="emph">imagination</span>
               is the most brilliant part of ourselves: it is, if we may use the expression, the
               volatile part of the soul; it is a kind of exhalation which disperses itself
               throughout the universe, and sometimes even passes the boundaries of it. Among
               philosophers, it calls forth new worlds from nothing; among the poets, it personifies
               the flowers and the springs; in short, every object of inanimate nature. Among the
               painters, it traces a new earth and new heavens; among metaphysicians, it darts
               forward to the Divinity himself; in all conditions and circumstances, it furnishes
               expedients, and forebodes good or evil; in every age, it has formed useful projects,
               and advanced the progress of the arts. The world would have given us nothing but bare
               dates, etymologies, and facts, if the imagination had not added its embellishments;
               and men, like so many echoes, would have repeated the same things, from the beginning
               of time to the present hour. It has, nevertheless, been the endeavour of some writers
               to decry the faculty, and to consider it as one of the most unfavourable gifts of the
               Creator; but such a depreciation of it must have arisen from a false comprehension of
               its powers, or an ignorance of its resources. It will surely be acknowledged that
               human happiness depends, in no small degree, on the manner in which objects are
               represented to our attention; and the part which the imagination must necessarily
               take in such an operation, will determine its value. </span></p>
         <p><span class="letter">Set the imagination in motion, and it will be found to be a far
               superior source of pleasure to our senses: it gives ideas of fortune when we are not
               rich, and they console us; it inspires hopes when we are in pursuit of any object,
               which encourage us; it suspends grief when we suffer, and that suspension calms us;
               it represents to us our country and our friends, when we are in a foreign clime, and
               that representation dissipates our discontents; it transports us to the future, when
               the present annoys us; when we wish to recal the past, it reproduces the pleasures
               which have long since been enjoyed, and we re-enjoy them; it fills the mind with new
               and cheerful ideas when we are cast down, and these delights, which are within
               ourselves, are far superior to those which are without us; it gives substance to the
               dead whom we lament, and we are comforted for their loss, by this power which we have
               of restoring them, as it were, to existence; it even elevates us to heaven, and
               enables us to contemplate a life of endless happiness, while our sorrows appear as a
               necessary part of our system, as the scene of a drama which is about to close.
            </span></p>
         <p><span class="letter">If learned men were without imagination, we should find them only
               in the beaten track of fact and memory, while they would do nothing more than repeat
               what the ancients had said and done before them. It is most true, that the judgment
               is the grand basis of our intellect, and must serve it as a rule, a guide, and a
               support; but the judgment, unassisted by the imagination, will proceed with a slow
               and heavy pace. It is the latter which elevates the soul to its native region; nor am
               I afraid to assert, paradoxical as it may appear, that the man who has nothing more
               than mere good sense, as it is called, crawls upon the earth, being destitute of that
               fine, impelling elasticity, which can alone quicken the mind into that superior state
               of activity and energy of which it is capable, and for which it is designed. We see
               examples of this among certain phlegmatic nations, whose character is that of rude,
               inanimate reason, and who neither excel in conversation, composition, or invention;
               who are astonished at the display of lively and shining talents, while whatever
               requires a prompt and vigorous execution, disturbs and disconcerts them. </span></p>
         <p><span class="letter">It must, however, be acknowledged, that this good sense, in its
               insulated state, is superior to the imagination, when left alone to the uncontrouled
               exercise of its own impetuosities; but it is not less true, that reason is but a
               tardy principle when it is not enlivened by the soul, and refined by the imagination.
               It is by quitting the beaten road, and taking a flight superior to his
               contemporaries, that a man acquires the character of genius: he is but an ordinary
               person who invents or improves nothing. It may be said, indeed, that good sense is
               attended with no danger, and that genius is continually on the verge of it. But who
               will venture to speak of our ancestors in terms of applause, who accused those of
               sorcery and secret communication with the devil, whose inquisitive and active minds
               dived into the secrets of nature, and displayed the phenomena of the natural world,
               some of whom were conveyed to the flames? What character shall we give of that age,
               when Galileo was punished with a prison for making those astronomical discoveries
               which truth and experiment have confirmed, and have since been adopted by every
               civilized nation? Perhaps it may be suggested, that this confined reason was the
               misfortune of those times, and that a too great indulgence of the imagination is a
               defect of our own: to produce perfection, then, they must be united. While the mere
               man of imagination may be too often on the brink of error, the efforts of
               unassociated reason are cold, phlegmatic, and uninteresting; but he who is possessed
               of them both, may be considered, in the best sense of the term, as a real genius.
            </span></p>
         <p><span class="letter">When we persuade ourselves that every thing is the effect of
               imagination, it is then that we indulge it to a very dangerous degree of excess, and
               become the victims of it; it then acts against itself: and while we suppose ourselves
               to be possessed of a superior degree of penetration and intelligence, we are but
               visionaries. It may be dangerous degree of excess, and become victims of it; it then
               acts against itself: and while we suppose ourselves to be possessed of a superior
               degree of penetration and intelligence, we are but visionaries. It may be dangerous
               to believe too much, but is more so to believe nothing at all. The ancients were
               often too credulous, because they did not apply to experiment; while we of this age,
               who are for trying every thing by that test, are too apt to doubt of every thing;
               blind credulity proceeds from the one, and a bold incredulity springs from the other:
               but when they are tempered by a happy commixture, it need not be added, that the
               nature of our faith will be at once rational and enlightened. </span></p>
         <p><span class="letter">What a delightful power, then, the imagination is, when guided by
               reason! It takes its flight through the universe; sometimes to contemplate its
               beauties--at others, to reduce them to nothing: it darts forward into space beyond
               the reach of the senses, and which seems to be the region of spirits. They who are
               under the dominion of the senses, have no other than a sensual gratification, and
               give up all those superior sentiments, the cultivation and indulgence of which we may
               call <span class="emph">the enjoyment of ourselves</span>: whereas, when we encourage
               only corporeal ideas, we must understand by <span class="emph">ourselves</span>, that
               case of corruption with which we are environed; and by <span class="emph"
                  >enjoyment</span>, an abandonment to sensual pleasures. In what a miserable state,
               then, is man, when he thus grovels on the earth, on which it becomes him to tread
               with the dignity of which his nature is susceptible! </span></p>
         <p><span class="letter">The excellence of the imagination cannot be denied; it is essential
               to the advancement of science and of art; and, above all, calculated to purify,
               subtilize, and refine our sensual affections: it is its irregularities alone which
               seduce us. There is nothing which gives the mind more convincing notions of its own
               grandeur, than this superior faculty: under its influence, man finds himself
               possessed, as it were, of a creative power, and he is frequently astonished at the
               variety of his productions. We frequently resemble a state of chaos, where nothing is
               to be distinguished; and our desires and our thoughts are so confused, that we cannot
               bring them into order or arrangement till the imagination comes to our aid, when we
               quickly perceive ourselves enlivened and embellished, while beauties spring up in the
               mind to surprise and delight us. The imagination is the most brilliant power which we
               possess: it is a sublime talent, with which we are endowed for the happiest purposes;
               and, under a due regulation, it will never fail to attain them. </span></p>
         <p><span class="letter">An attention to this subject is of the most importance in our early
               days, when the mind is less disturbed by cares and serious avocations, when it enjoys
               a kind of holiday between the period of education and the settled employments of
               life. The heart, says the wise man, is deceitful above all things; and there is no
               power which so effectually aids its delusions as that of the imagination: they who
               are under its unsubjugated influence, may be said to be <span class="emph">flying
                  with their wings before their eyes</span>. Akenside's poem on its pleasures is the
               work of a superior man; and I cannot but wish that some poet of equal genius would
               illustrate the pains of it. But I have proceeded to a great length, and you must have
               already perceived that the difficulty of writing increases with every line. I can
               only add the blessing of </span></p>

            mother.</span></span></p>
