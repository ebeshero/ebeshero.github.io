         </div>
         <p><span>I have been absolutely inundated with letters from the country, in consequence of
               my last paper; in some of which I have not been treated with the urbanity which I am
               disposed to hope I deserve. </span></p>
         <p><span>It was not my design to represent a country life as a necessary scene of inferior
               vice and folly , of which I have been accused, but merely to state the disappointment
               that too often follows from forming erroneous notions of it. I have seldom if ever
               known a person, who, after a life of active business in <span class="placeName"
                  >London</span>, retired to rural life, with a view of being happy in rural
               enjoyments, who experienced the satisfaction which was expected from them. It must be
               obvious to rational reflection, that long habits of anxious employment, the getting
               up early, the late taking rest, and eating the bread of carefulness, will disqualify
               a man from enjoying a situation where listless hours pass in succession, with little
               to awaken thought or excite activity in minds unprepared by science or education for
               intellectual occupation. I have an example from my own neighbourhood in the country,
               and I doubt not that many others might be found in other neighbourhoods, to support
               the rectitude of my opinion. </span></p>
         <p><span>The worthy man to whom I allude, after passing thirty years in the bustle of a
               retail trade in one of the principal streets of the metropolis, found himself in
               possession of a handsome fortune, and actualed by a wish to retire to the
               tranquillity of a country life. His wife, who had contrived to acquire rather a
               predominant influence over his actions, happened, on this occasion, to entertain a
               similar sentiment. Where money is plenty, wishes of this kind are readily gratified;
               and a handsome house, with all the requisite rural appurtenances, was purchased at
               the distance of thirty miles from town. It was in a retired village, where a man of
               his opulence would be sure to be regarded with no common consideration. He
               accordingly thought it one of the happiest days of his life, when, in his coach and
               four, he received the homage of the villagers who were assembled to greet his
               arrival, and he never had heard more cheering sounds than those of the peal of bells
               which announced it to the neighbourhood. </span></p>
         <p><span>For the first week every thing was delightful; the novelty of the scene, and his
               conscious importance, pleased his curiosity and gratified his vanity. Nay, on the
               first Sunday, he was so delighted with sitting in a high place in the church, and the
               service waiting for his presence, that, for the first time during many years, he
               remained awake from the beginning to the end of it. </span></p>
         <p><span>A month, however, had not passed away before he became so tired of having nothing
               to do, and no new object to see, that he disposed of his place at a considerable
               loss, and purchased another, which was on the side of a high-road, and promised him a
               continual scene of amusing objects, of which he lived in the perpetual enjoyment. At
               a small distance from his mansion there most fortunately happened to be a turnpike;
               and, in an armchair, at the entrance of the collector’s house, he passed the whole of
               every day, except the short time allowed for his meals. While his good lady shewed
               her handsome equipage to the country, and entertained her neighbours, he shewed his
               figure to every traveler on the road, and entertained himself with keeping a regular
               account of the daily passage of horsemen, one-horse chaises, and every other kind of
               carriage that passed through the turnpike. There was his chief, indeed his only
               pleasure, and there he shared the repeated bowl and social pipe with the succession
               of men who took the toll; till, in consequence of the exposure of himself at all
               times and in all seasons, he brought on a disorder which terminated his life.
            </span></p>
         <p><span>Virtue is not local; and there may be as much virtue exercised in <span
                  class="placeName">Portman-square</span>, as in the remotest part of <span
                  class="placeName">Yorkshire</span>: but from the different modes of living in town
               and country, they cannot be so fully displayed in the one as in the other. A town
               house is a very confined scene of action. Neighbours in the metropolis having no
               necessary connection; and the lower classes have no other association, and that a
               very distant one, but as they may be incidentally employed by them. Pleasure,
               ceremony, and public business compose the whole of an independent town life: while in
               the country, a gentleman has his personal occupations; he receives his visitors as a
               part of his family; he lives among his tenants; his actions are all known; he is at
               once an example and an authority, and may be, as many are, a blessing to all around
               him. </span></p>
         <p><span>At present I shall prove my perfect impartiality by adding a letter, which gives a
               different picture of a country life from that which appeared in my last paper. It is
               equally founded in nature and in truth, and will, I hope, restore me to the good
               opinion of those of my readers whom I appear, though I must think very undeservedly,
               to have offended. </span></p>
         <div class="letter">
            <p><span class="letter">TO THE MODERN SPECTATOR.</span></p>
            <p><span class="letter">Sir,--Without meaning to question the probability of the account
                  which you gave of the <span class="persName">Overhill</span> family in your last
                  number, I beg leave to offer you the representation of a country family, which, I
                  hope, will redeem provincial life from those unfavourable impressions which <span
                     class="persName">Mr. Truman</span>’s letter is calculated to produce. I have
                  also paid a long-promised visit to a relation, a reverend divine, in a distant
                  part of <span class="placeName">England</span>; but I found him in a mansion
                  “where sweet content doth dwell and learned ease,” and which the virtues and the
                  graces inhabit in an inseparable union. </span></p>
            <p><span class="letter">As the time of my arrival was known, I was met by <span
                     class="persName">Doctor Goodall</span> about five miles from his house, when,
                  dismounting from his horse, he got into my chaise, embraced me with a glow of
                  honest affection, and prepared me, by his conversation, for the reception I was to
                  find, and the comfort I was to enjoy beneath his roof. He had ordered the
                  postillion to take a private road, which led to the gate of his garden, where I
                  found <span class="persName">Mrs. Goodall</span> and her two eldest daughters
                  ready to receive me in a manner at once polite and affectionate. We walked through
                  a delightful garden to the house, where the youngest daughter, a counterpart in
                  form and manners of those I had already seen, was prepared to welcome me with a
                  smile of modesty and regard to the happy threshold. She apologized with a most
                  graceful simplicity for not having been at the garden-gate to receive me; but her
                  sisters and herself, she said, took it by turns to be housekeepers for the week;
                  and that being the term of her office, it became her to remain within the circle
                  of her duty: “However,” added she, “I have also my advantage, as, from the
                  circumstance, I shall have the more immediate pleasure of attending upon you.”
               </span></p>
            <p><span class="letter">I now entered a large, old-fashioned, convenient house, where
                  cleanliness and comfort seemed to occupy every corner; and while I sat at the
                  tea-table, surrounded with these amiable people, I enjoyed a state of tranquil
                  luxury, which the hurries of a hurrying life had prevented me from having hitherto
                  experienced. The rest of the evening passed, as it had begun, in conversation
                  which wanted neither interest nor vivacity; when supper was served at an early
                  hour, on account of my journey; and prayers having been read by the doctor to the
                  whole family. I was conducted to my chamber. With a mind soothed by the pleasing
                  attentions of this excellent family, and my body rather fatigued by a
                  cross-country journey of fifty miles, I need not add, that my repose was calm and
                  sound; and that I awoke in the morning to health, spirits, and satisfaction.
               </span></p>
            <p><span class="letter">The prospect from my chamber was over a beautiful lawn, varied
                  by plantations and enameled with flowers; and, on opening the window, a voice,
                  sweet as music, bade me good morrow. It was to the eldest of the young ladies, who
                  was gathering a nosegay to present to me at breakfast, to whom I was indebted for
                  the charming salutation; and I was immediately summoned by a gentle rap at the
                  door, and another votive good morrow, from the second of the sisterhood, who
                  conducted me into a long gallery, with a large bow-window at the end of it, round
                  whose Gothic frame the jessamine and the honeysuckle mingled their flowers and
                  their fragrance. Here the breakfast was arranged, whose luxuries were supplied by
                  the housewifery of the girls; and here were continued the delightful enjoyments of
                  the preceding evening, heightened by a new day, a smiling sky, invigorated
                  spirits, and unconstrained regard. </span></p>
            <p><span class="letter">This gallery seemed to contain every thing that could improve
                  the mind, and fill up the day with elegant useful amusement. At the opposite end
                  of it, there was a small organ and other instruments of music, with a large glass
                  case, which contained a well arranged philosophical apparatus; and, in other parts
                  of this capacious room, there were implements, not only of design and embroidery,
                  but of the less elegant, though, perhaps, more necessary branches of female
                  qualification. </span></p>
            <p><span class="letter">When I had examined this well-ordered arrangement of domestic
                  pleasure, the doctor proposed a walking excursion, in order to shew me, what he
                  very justly styled, the comforts of his little domain. We, therefore, sallied
                  forth, and, passing through the garden, entered a well-planted serpentine walk,
                  which commanded various views of a very pleasing country; and, continuing to skirt
                  a very rich, but narrow valley for about a mile, terminated in a small grove of
                  stately oaks and beeches. Beneath this spot a rivulet meandered, whose surface was
                  agitated by a waterfall, which, though at some distance, formed a beautiful object
                  for the eye, while it enlivened the ear by its irregular murmurs. Here we all sat
                  down, under a kind of over-hanging clift, covered with ivy and skirted with
                  laurel. At this moment, my senses, which were wrapped up in the charming
                  circumstances about me, received a sudden, but delightful animation, by the
                  bursting forth of the village peal, which, in unequal and swelling sounds,
                  congratulated my arrival. The doctor enlarged upon the rude state in which he
                  found the place at his first coming to it, with the plan of its subsequent
                  improvements. In one spot he acknowledged the suggestions of his wife, in others
                  the fancy of his girls; and thus we continued our return to the house, which
                  received a very pleasing variety from our passing through the village, where I
                  perceived, with much sensibility, the affectionate respect which the humble
                  parishioners were proud of shewing to their pastor. When we reached the rectory,
                  the doctor retired, without apology, to his study; and his good lady, after
                  telling me that a bell would ring to give me half an hour’s notice of dinner,
                  retired with my fair cousins to the little offices of the toilette. </span></p>
            <p><span class="letter">I then went for a short time to my chamber, and afterwards,
                  strolled into the garden, where, beneath the shade of a sycamore, I amused myself
                  in comparing the vain, noisy, intruding hospitality of public life, with the calm,
                  cheerful, and unaffected welcome of <span class="placeName">Goodington
                     Parsonage</span>. Nay, so deeply were my thoughts engaged in reflecting on the
                  superiority of virtue, and the contentment which arises from innocent pleasures,
                  over the interrupted, feverish delights, if they may deserve that name, of
                  ostentation, folly, and fashion, that the dinner bell had rung twice without my
                  hearing its summons; so that when dinner was served, the <span class="placeName"
                     >London</span> cousin was lost, till those voices, which were sufficient to
                  animate the trees around me, called me to myself, and the hospitable board that
                  waited my appearance. </span></p>
            <p><span class="letter">There I found the doctor’s curate, a young divine of very
                  amiable aspect; and a modest, well-behaved, neighbouring young squire, who had
                  just completed an university education, and was about taking possession of a very
                  handsome estate adjoining to the doctor’s parish. The table was covered with
                  plenty, and possessed all the luxuries of nature unsophisticated by those of art.
                  Good humour came with the dessert, and an enlivened conversation filled up the
                  interval, till we were summoned to tea at a little cottage, whose front commands a
                  cheerful prospect of rural variety; while the back part communicates with the
                  dairy and a small farm, whose occupations amuse the leisure, and whose productions
                  supply the table, of its reverend owner, </span></p>
            <p><span class="letter">Here I drank milk warm from the cow, saw the arrangements of
                  tillage and pasture with a more minute intelligent eye than I had hitherto seen
                  them; was instructed in the nature and amused with the process of rearing the
                  various species of fowl for use or amusement, and found my cup of tea brimful of
                  fragrance. </span></p>
            <p><span class="letter">An approaching storm forced our return sooner than was intended;
                  but it could not be too soon for the entertainment that followed. A concert in the
                  gallery concluded the evening. The young ladies took their separate instruments,
                  while the curate and the Oxonian aided the charming band. My fair cousins
                  sometimes sung alone, and sometimes in parts, and their mother joined the chorus;
                  while I, delighted with the harmonious scene, could only ask myself, whether I was
                  on earth or in heaven. </span></p>
            <p><span class="letter">I have thus given you, sir, a complete description of one day,
                  that you may form a judgment of all the rest; which, though varied by excursions,
                  the visits of neighbours, and country amusements, were all equally pleasant,
                  rational, and improving. </span></p>
            <p><span class="letter">To enjoy mirth without noise, conversation without calumny,
                  luxury without extravagance, elegance without vanity, and pleasure without
                  repentance, was my happy lot during the month which I passed at <span
                     class="placeName">Goodington Parsonage</span>. </span></p>
