         <div class="letter">
            <p><span class="letter"><span class="persName">Mr. SPECTATOR</span>, </span></p>
            <p><span class="letter">I have somewhere read of a good woman, who, on coming from
                  church after she had been married, exclaimed most emphatically, “Thank heaven! the
                  troublesome business of love is <span class="emph">now</span> at an end.” It has
                  also been said, in the same spirit, that lovers are no less altered by marriage
                  than drunken men are by sleep. </span></p>
            <p><span class="letter">I have also frequently seen a pair of prints which represents
                  the latter opinion in a more striking manner than words can possibly describe.
                  They were published at a period when the art of engraving was not brought to its
                  present state of perfection: but though they would not be suffered to appear in
                  the windows of <span class="persName">Mr. Ackermann</span>’s shop, where I have so
                  often been, and the passing crowds are so continually arrested to view its
                  attractive display of art, taste, and beauty, these inferior productions,
                  nevertheless, tell their story with considerable effect, though fitted only for
                  the walls of a country alehouse, or the stall of a country fair. </span></p>
            <p><span class="letter">The titles of these two pictures are <span class="emph">Before
                     Marriage</span> and <span class="emph">After Marriage</span>. The scene is the
                  same in both: it is entirely rural, and consists of a field with a path through
                  it, a thick hedge, a spreading oak, a lofty, awkward stile, and a distant view of
                  the country. The living characters are a young lady and gentleman, who are to be
                  supposed as taking a lover’s walk. </span></p>
            <p><span class="letter">In the first this happy pair are seen passing the stile, and
                  nothing can exceed the tender, assiduous care with which the fond <span
                     class="persName">Damon</span> assists his beloved <span class="persName"
                     >Lucinda</span> in clearing the difficulties of this troublesome barrier, while
                  she appears to display a modest pride from the attentions of her enamoured swain.
                  The companion print exhibits the same persons, the same stile, and the same
                  scenery; but the acting characters, who are supposed to be man and wife, and may
                  have been so for three weeks or a month, are already in a state of separation. She
                  is clambering over the stile, at the risk of breaking her legs, and calling in
                  vain assistance; while he appears to be walking at some distance before her, and
                  whistling for want of thought; or if he has any, the late adorable object of his
                  everlasting tenderness and unchangeable affection, does not seem to occupy an atom
                  of it. </span></p>
            <p><span class="letter">I first saw these pictures in a cake-shop when I was a boy at
                  school, and having made them the subject of an exercise, the master on reading it
                  clapped me on the head, and prognosticated that I should die an old bachelor. I
                  must, however, observe by the way, that the learned doctor himself was so far from
                  being one of those inattentive husbands, that it was evident to all his scholars,
                  as well as to the whole neighbourhood, that he practised the most submissive
                  obedience to a very imperious wife: so that the boys, whenever he thought it
                  proper to scourge them, felt a vindictive satisfaction in the reflection, that in
                  the course of twenty-four hours at least <span class="persName">Mrs.
                     Thwackem</span> would avenge them by one or other of her domestic
                  chastisements. </span></p>
            <p><span class="letter">This vaticination of my sage <span class="persName"
                     >Merlin</span> of a schoolmaster has been fulfilled as far as I have hitherto
                  proceeded in the journey of life. I am as yet a single man, and my own opinion is,
                  that I shall continue to keep at a very respectful distance from the hymeneal
                  alter. I must, however, acknowledge when I have been told by some of my <span
                     class="emph">new</span>-married friends what an uncomfortable life I appear to
                  lead, that I have begun to waver a little in my partiality to a single state; but,
                  on the other hand, when some of my <span class="emph">old</span>-married
                  acquaintance have declared what an enviable life mine was, I have been confirmed
                  in my design to go a bachelor to my grave. In this resolution I have lately been
                  more than ever confirmed by the conduct of a near relation of mine, who was
                  brought up to the sea and was very fond of his profession: he, however, happened
                  to marry a very pretty woman, with a very handsome fortune, when he retired into
                  the country with his charming bride, spoke with disregard of a naval life, and,
                  having got such a warm matrimonial birth, he hoped never to see the inside of a
                  ship’s cabin again as long as he lived. Nevertheless, after he had enjoyed the
                  undisturbed felicity of rural life, and the delights of connubial love, for about
                  eighteen months, he came up to town, and, on my calling to see him, I was
                  informed, to my extreme astonishment, that he was gone to the Admiralty to solicit
                  a ship. On my meeting him the next day, he said that a life of indolence was
                  unbecoming a man; that, in the present state of the country, it was disgraceful
                  for a sailor to withhold his services; and that the most delightful thing in the
                  world was a frigate and a cruise. </span></p>
            <p><span class="letter">Such being my situation, it may be thought by certain
                  unreflecting people, that I am not qualified to treat a subject of which matrimony
                  forms the principal feature. This I shall, without the least reserve, take upon me
                  to deny. I may not, it is true, be able to write from experimental facts; but I
                  may be capable surely of forming an adequate judgment from attentive and
                  unprejudiced observation. I bear no hostility to the wedded life as such: on the
                  contrary, I believe it, when accompanied with pure love, perfect confidence, and
                  similarity of disposition, to be the real heaven upon earth. But then, I know
                  also, that when it is composed of different ingredients, which, according to my
                  view of things, too often happens, it produces a very opposite condition, which I
                  shall not venture to describe. This reflection so affects my nerves, which are not
                  very strong, that I tremble at the idea of entering into a state whose happiness
                  is so uncertain, and whose ordinary inconvenienies I have not the strength to
                  encounter. </span></p>
            <p><span class="letter">I am well aware, for it has never been my habit to be satisfied
                  with superficial speculations, that matrimony is not only essential to the
                  support, but the good order and happiness, of civil society. Thus matrimony forms
                  families which could not be formed without it, and families form states which
                  could not be formed without them. It was the first <span class="emph"
                     >natural</span> union which preceded and prepared mankind for <span
                     class="emph">civil</span> union; and the bonds of the second union were more
                  effectually strengthened by those paternal and filial affection and consanguinity,
                  than they could have been by those alone of accidental interests liable to vary,
                  and of covenants liable to be broken. </span></p>
            <p><span class="letter">On such principles, and for such purposes, matrimony was
                  instituted. This is my opinion, and if I were certain that I should produce
                  heroes, or statesmen, or philosophers, men who would be eminently useful in
                  society, I would take the first opportunity of changing my condition, and risk all
                  domestic consequences for the sake of my country; but with such a puny frame and
                  fine-strung nerves as nature has given me, with my habits of study and sentimental
                  cast of character, I have more than a shrewd suspicion, that my offspring would be
                  fit only to form petit-maitres and men milliners; a class of people, who, if they
                  were banished from the world, it would be the better for their dismission. It is
                  not, I repeat it, from any aversion to the married state, that I keep at an awful
                  distance from the temple of Hymen. On the contrary, I reverence his rites, though
                  I am not one of his immediate votaries. It is not that I am indifferent to women,
                  for I find the principal charm of life in their society. In short, I do not
                  venture into the matrimonial lottery from the trembling apprehension that I should
                  draw a blank, or which is equally probable, be a blank myself. </span></p>
            <p><span class="letter"><span class="persName">Plato</span> has a very beautiful
                  allegory on love and marriage, which will illustrate my feelings on these
                  important subjects in a much better manner than I can do it for myself.
               </span></p>
            <p><span class="letter">Mankind, as fabulously presumed by that amiable, benevolent, but
                  fanciful, philosopher, were not, in their original state, divided into male and
                  female as at present; but each individual person was a compound of both sexes, and
                  was in himself both husband and wife, melted down into one living creature. This
                  union must have been, under such supposition, perfect and entire, and the parts
                  admirably adjusted together, since there resulted an uninterrupted harmony between
                  the male and female, although they were thus compelled to be inseparable
                  companions. In short, says the fable, so great was the happiness flowing from it,
                  that these MEN-WOMEN, as <span class="persName">Plato</span> calls them, became
                  insolent upon their prosperity, and rebelled against the gods. To punish them for
                  their temerity, Jupiter could contrive no better expedient than to divorce the
                  male part from the female, and make two imperfect beings of the compound, which
                  was before so perfect. Hence the origin of men and women as distinct creatures.
                  But notwithstanding this division, so lively is our remembrance of the happiness
                  which we enjoyed in our primeval state, that we are never at rest in this
                  situation; but each of these halves is continually searching through the whole
                  species to find the other half which was broken from it, and when they meet they
                  join again with the greatest fondness and sympathy. But it too often happens that
                  they are mistaken in this particular, so that they take for their half what in no
                  way corresponds with them, and then the parts do not meet nor join in with each
                  other, as is usual in fractures. In this case the union is soon dissolved, and
                  each part is set loose again to hunt for its lost half, joining itself to every
                  one whom it meets by way of trial; and enjoying no rest till its perfect sympathy
                  with its partner shews that it has, at last, been successful in its endeavours.
               </span></p>
            <p><span class="letter">From this very ingenious fable <span class="persName">Dr.
                     Watts</span> borrowed the thought on which he has founded his little poem
                  entitled <span class="emph">Few happy Matches</span>; and <span class="persName"
                     >Hume</span> has carried on and completed this fiction of the Greek philosopher
                  with his characteristic ingenuity, and in the following manner: </span></p>
            <p><span class="letter">When Jupiter had separated the male from the female, and had
                  quelled their pride and ambition by so severe an operation, he repented of the
                  cruelty of his resentment, and compassionated the situation of poor mortals, who
                  were now become incapable of repose or tranquility. Such cravings, anxieties, and
                  necessities arose, as made them curse their creation, and think existence itself a
                  punishment. In vain had they recourse to every other occupation and amusement. In
                  vain did they seek after every pleasure of sense and refinement of reason. Nothing
                  could fill that void which they felt in their hearts, or supply the loss of their
                  partner, who was so fatally separated from them. To remedy this disorder, and to
                  bestow some comfort, at least, on the human race in their forlorn situation,
                  Jupiter sent down Love and Hymen to collect the broken halves of mankind, and to
                  piece them together in the best possible manner. These two deities found suck a
                  prompt disposition in mankind to unite again in their primitive state, that they
                  proceeded on their work, for some time, with the most uninterrupted success; till,
                  at last, from various unlucky accidents, a dissention arose between them. The
                  chief counsellor and favourite of Hymen was Care, who was continually filling his
                  patron’ head with prospects of futurity, such as settlements, family, children,
                  and domestic arrangements, so that little else was regarded in all the matches
                     <span class="emph">they</span> made. On the other hand, Love had chosen
                  Pleasure for his favourite, who proved as pernicious a counsellor as the other,
                  and would never allow Love to look beyond the present momentary gratification or
                  the satisfying the prevailing inclination. These two favourites became, in a very
                  short time, irreconcileable enemies, and made it their chief business to undermine
                  each other in all the undertakings. No sooner had Love fixed upon two halves,
                  which he was cementing together and forming to a close union, than Care insinuates
                  himself, and, bringing Hymen along with him, dissolves the union produced by Love,
                  and joins each half to some other half which he had provided for it. To be
                  revenged of this insidious conduct, Pleasure creeps in upon a pair already joined
                  by Hymen, and calling Love to his assistance, they underhand contrive to join each
                  half by secret links to halves with which Hymen was wholly unacquainted. It was
                  not long before this quarrel was felt in its pernicious consequences; and such
                  complaints arose before the throne of Jupiter, that he ordered the offending
                  parties to be summoned before him, when, after hearing the pleadings on both
                  sides, he ordered an immediate reconciliation betwixt Love and Hymen, as the only
                  expedient for giving happiness to mankind. And that he might be sure this
                  reconciliation should be durable, he laid his injunctions on them, never to join
                  any halves without consulting Care and Pleasure, and the obtaining the consent of
                  both to the conjunction. Where this order is strictly observed the two beings
                  combine to form one happy creature. </span></p>
            <p><span class="letter">Such are the principles, and such the chances, on which
                  matrimonial happiness is founded. I acknowledge the former, but I have not nerve
                  enough to risk the latter. But it may be asked of me, how I, who pretend to fulfil
                  the duties of life, can venture to acknowledge a disobedience to that essential
                  command which tells me to increase and multiply. I have, however, my answer at
                  hand in the form of a younger brother, who is about to be married, not only with
                  my consent, but by my desire. I propose to settle very handsomely on the marriage,
                  and shall leave my fortune to the issue of it. I, therefore, <span
                     class="persName">Mr. Spectator</span>, hope you will be of opinion, that I
                  shall have fulfilled this great end of my creation, by qualifying honest <span
                     class="persName">Jack</span> to do that for me which I feel such an
                  apprehension of doing for myself; and that, under these circumstances, I may hope
                  to die in peace, though I die </span></p>
