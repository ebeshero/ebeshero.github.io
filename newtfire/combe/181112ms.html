         </div>
         <p><span>The first application of the industry of men must be to procure the necessaries of
               life: by agriculture, to supply themselves with food; by simple manufactures, to
               furnish themselves with clothes; by surrounding their towns with walls, to defend
               themselves from sudden attacks; and by establishing laws, to secure their property
               and the peaceable enjoyments of the fruits of their labour. </span></p>
         <p><span>When some progress is made in the attainment of these primitive objects; and when
               human ingenuity has found out the means of facilitating labour, by which some part of
               society can do more than is necessary to supply their own wants, and accordingly
               become exempted, in a great measure, from corporeal toil; the human mind, stimulated
               by a natural love of excellence and distinction, begins to think of improvements, and
               to ad what is convenient to that which is necessary; till, at length, the views of
               men being extended, and their genius and taste being refined, the elegances and
               pleasures of life are objects of attention, the productions of men of superior
               talents are admired and cherished, poems are read with pleasure, and pictures and
               statues are beheld with delight. </span></p>
         <p><span>Such is the manner in which <span class="persName">Lucretius</span>, who holds a
               very high rank among the didactic poets, has traced the progress of social man, from
               the period when he quits what is called the savage state, till he finds himself
               advanced, by gradual and growing improvements, to an age of science and of taste.
                  <span class="persName">Lucretius</span> was a poet of the Augustan age; and though
               his poem is written to support the most absurd, unphilosophical, and profane system
               that erring genius ever adopted, he lived at a time when <span class="placeName"
                  >Rome</span> had attained the summit of literary glory, as well as of that taste
               and refined elegance, which, after the lapse of so many ages, it is our boast to
               admire and imitate; and which will continue to have admirers and imitators,
            </span></p>
         <p><span>Till chaos lets its sable curtains fall,</span></p>
         <p><span>And universal darkness buries all.</span></p>
         <p><span>The reign of <span class="persName">Augustus Caesar</span> was the age of taste in
                  <span class="placeName">Rome</span>; that of <span class="persName">Louis
                  XIV</span>, was the age of taste in <span class="placeName">France</span>; the
               period of the <span class="persName">Medici</span> family was that of taste in modern
                  <span class="placeName">Italy</span>; and when, may be asked, was the age of taste
               in <span class="placeName">England</span>? Can it be considered as an ill-founded
               partiality to the times in which we live, if it were to be answered, the reign of
                  <span class="persName">George the III.</span>? This may not be an uninteresting
               subject of consideration and enquiry. But, in order to prepare the way for a just and
               accurate decision, it will be necessary to determine in what that feeling, sentiment,
               or faculty of discernment in the mind, which is called taste, consists. </span></p>
         <p><span>Taste, taken in its most extensive signification, is, in relation to works, the
               knowlege of what merits the estimation of mankind. In the arts and sciences, there
               are some respecting whose excellence the public are ever predisposed to adopt the
               opinion of men of skill, and seldom or never venture to pronounce a decisive judgment
               as proceeding from themselves: such are geometry, mechanics, certain branches of
               natural philosophy, and painting. In these arts and sciences, the men of taste are
               the persons who are versed in them; and taste is, in these various kinds, the
               knowledge of their respective excellence. </span></p>
         <p><span>This is not altogether the case with respect to those works of which mankind are,
               or believe themselves to be, capable of forming, in a greater or less degree, a
               reasonable judgment: such as poems, plays, romances, novels, ethic discourses,
               politics, &amp;c. &amp;c. In these various productions, however, of the human
               intellect, or imagination, we must not understand by taste, the exact knowledge of
               what is suited to the character, genius, and habits of an individual people or
               nation. </span></p>
         <p><span>There appear to be two methods of arriving at this knowledge, and consequently,
               two different kinds of taste. The one, like that of players, who, by the daily study
               of the ideas, sentiments, and representations calculated to please the public, become
               good judges of theatrical works, and especially those that resemble dramatic pieces
               already published. The other is a rational taste, founded on an accurate knowledge of
               human nature, and the spirit of the age, and which particularly qualifies theose who
               possess it to judge of originaln works. He who has only an habitual taste must
               experience its inefficacy whenever he is destitute of objects of comparison; but the
               rational of superior taste can be acquired only by the study of that particular art
               or science which is the favorite object of pretension. Hence proceeds the common
               expression of forming a taste; and when <span class="persName">Sir Joshua
                  Reynolds</span>, in one of his admirable lectures, seems to support an opinion,
               that genius may be acquired by study, he could have intended to convey little, if any
               thing more, than that by continual observation and reflection a correct and accurate
               taste might be obtained. </span></p>
         <p><span>Men of letters are not always the best judges in that individual branch of
               literature wherein they have most excelled. This may appear to be an absolute
               solecism; but it is far otherwise, and a satisfactory explanation is at hand.--It is
               with great writers, as with great painters, each has his manner. Some express their
               ideas with a force, a warmth, and an energy peculiar to themselves: some present them
               in an arrangement with a perspicuity and a combination of words peculiarly their own;
               while others unfold them with fancy, grandeur, and elegance: but each of them is
               partial to his own taste, and, considering his own manner as the best, will, of
               course, set a greater value on the man of moderate abilities who seizes it, than on
               the man of genius who has a taste of his own. Hence spring the different judgments so
               often formed on the same work by writers of acknowledged talents, as well as by the
               public. </span></p>
         <p><span>To pursue the subject somewhat farther, it may be observed, that many people have
               a kind of happy instinct in matters of taste, which enables them to determine aright
               on difficult subjects, without having any principle to direct their judgments; nor
               can it be doubted that if the natural faculties of such persons were cultivatd, they
               would acquire a superior taste. But taste being a combination of man's judgment and
               feelings, there never can be any certainty in the decision or opinion of a man whose
               judgment has not been formed; and the surest, if not the only way to obtain that
               object, is by making comparisons. Now to make a perfect comparison between two
               objects, it is absolutely necessary to understand them both. Hence it follows that
               the first step to the acquiring a good taste is the attainment of knowledge, without
               which no comparison can be formed; while without comparisons the judgment cannot be
               chastened; and without judgment a correct taste cannot be acquired. </span></p>
         <p><span>Let us endeavour to illustrate this notion by an example. It may be supposed that
               a young man is anxious to possess a taste for sculpture. If nature has not given him
               feeling, he seeks an impossibility: if, however, she has supplied him with the
               necessary sensibility, he must then go in search of knowledge in order to form his
               judgment; and this knowledge is only to be acquired by seeing statues. To put an end
               to all cavilling, I shall define a statue to be an imitation of a man or woman. The
               first piece of marble, or stone, or bronze which he sees of this kind, will enable
               him to say, whether it resembles the human form; but he will not be qualified to
               determine on the merits of the sculpture. Good is a relative term, and it is only by
               comparing the statue with others, that he is enabled to decide on the degree of
               estimation which it possesses. <span class="persName">Apollo</span> is always
               represented as a beautiful young man; and numerous sculptors, ancient and modern,
               have made this pagan divinity a subject for the exertion of their chissels. Show a
               very indifferent example of this figure to an inexperienced person, and a fine one to
               another in the same disqualified state, and let them be the first statues that either
               of them has contemplated, and their judgments on both will probably be the same. He
               who has seen the <span class="persName">Apollo</span> of inferior workmanship will be
               as much charmed as he who has seen the superior representation, and his taste will be
               equally good. This statue is the best he has ever seen, and it is natural for him to
               admire it. Let him then see the <span class="persName">Apollo</span> of <span
                  class="placeName">Girardon</span>, that of <span class="persName">Bernini</span>,
               with others ancient and modern; such as have been formed on a study of the antique;
               and those, as is too much the case with the French artists, which are indebted to the
               ballet-master of the opera and the graces of its principal performers; but let him at
               length be brought to the <span class="persName">Apollo</span> of <span
                  class="placeName">Belvidere</span>. He will then have seen all the varieties and
               perfections of the art, at least in that branch of sculpture, which is generally
               thought to possess the most admirable example. If he examines each of these statues
               with attention, and afterwards compares them together, he will acquire the power of
               ascertaining the value of each, and of assigning to it its true rank. The knowledge
               that he has obtained, will form his judgment, his judgment will direct his feelings;
               and he will then have acquired a taste which will justify a reliance. </span></p>
         <p><span>In support of this mode of reasoning on subjects of taste, and particularly on the
               subject of sculpture, through they are equally applicable to all others, an authority
               of the first order may be produced from the treatise on the <span class="emph"
                  >Sublime and Beautiful</span>, by <span class="persName">Edmund Burke</span>.--
               If, says he, a man, to who sculpture is new, sees a barber's block, or some ordinary
               piece of statuary, he is immediately struck and pleased, because he sees something
               like a human figure, and, entirely taken up with this likeness, he does not at all
               attend to its defects. Some time after, it may be supposed that this novice lights
               upon a more artificial work of the same nature. He now begins to look with contempt
               on what he first admired; but though his knowledge is improved, his taste is not
               altered. And there can be little doubt that <span class="persName">Mr. Burke</span>'s
               opinion is well founded, that what is called a <span class="emph">natural
                  taste</span> is nearly common to all, and that a fine or correct taste is the
               result of study and observation. Hence the power of judging with truth and
               correctness, or what may be called a <span class="emph">critical taste</span>, does
               not depend upon a superior principle, but upon superior knowledge. </span></p>
         <p><span>The story of the ancient painter and shoemaker is too well known to justify a
               repetition. The latter corrected the former respecting some mistakes he had made in
               the shoe of one of his figures. But this was no improvement to the taste of the
               painter, who was content with a general resemblance; it only proved his deficiency in
               the art of shoe-making. There is also a traditionary relation to the same effect,
               that the artist who formed the equestrian statue of <span class="persName">Charles
                  the First</span>, had the remains of his life embittered, when he was informed of
               the observation of a stable boy, that he had omitted giving girths to the saddle on
               which the royal figure was placed. It had also been related, that when a fine piece
               of the decollated head of <span class="persName">St. John the Baptist</span> was
               shewn to a Turkish emperor, he praised many parts of it; at the same time he
               observed, as a defect, that the skin did not shrink from the wounded part of the
               neck. The sultan, on this occasion, though his observation was very just, discovered
               no more natural taste than the painter who executed the piece, or than a thousand
               European connoisseurs, who probably would never have made the same observation. <span
                  class="persName">His Turkish majesty</span>, it may be supposed, had been well
               acquainted with that terrible spectacle, which others could only have represented in
               their imagination. Hence proceeds the pleasure derived from a natural object, so far
               as it is justly imitated, or the satisfaction in seeing an agreeable figure, and the
               sympathy arising from a striking and affecting incident. </span></p>
         <p><span>The word taste, therefore, may be defined to be a faculty of the mind, which is
               affected with, or forms a judgment of, the works of imagination and the elegant arts.
               This seems to be the most general idea of the term, and altogether unconnected with
               any particular theory. It would be a curious, as well as a pleasing enquiry, whether
               there are any principles on this subject so grounded and certain as to supply the
               means of reasoning satisfactorily about them. I am disposed, indeed, to think that
               their existence may be proved; and, in some future essay, I may be induced to pursue
               the enquiry. I have already been carried so far into the considerations on taste,
               that the exemplary or illustrative parts of my subject must be deferred to a future
               occasion; and the important question, whether the present period forms a principal
               aera of taste in <span class="placeName">Great Britain</span>, will be the subject of
               my next paper. </span></p>
