         <p>LETTER III.</p>
         <p><span class="letter"><span class="opener"><span class="emph">My dear and ever honoured
                     Mother</span>, </span></span></p>
         <p><span class="letter">Your last half dozen lines afforded me inexpressible pleasure, for
               they brought me the entire approbation of your <span class="emph">Amelia</span>; and
               the consciousness that I endeavour to deserve, with the certainty that I have
               obtained it, affords my heart a satisfaction far superior to that which I receive
               from all the amusements, pleasures, and flattering circumstances which attend me
               here; and I do not pretend to be insensible to them. I see all that is best and most
               attractive in this great world of pride, opulence, taste, and fashion. I am
               accompanied in my progress by the most experienced guides; by persons who are well
               acquainted with the geography of the country, its language, laws, manners, and
               customs. In short, the most learned professors in the great school of high life, are
               ever ready to instruct me; and I have the never-failing vigilance of guardians, who
               are perfectly qualified to keep me in the right way, and to give me a clue by which I
               may pass through the labyrinth of pleasure, without losing my way amidst its mazes
               and meanders.--But, greatly as I feel myself indebted to them, and advantageous as
               their counsels have been and are to me, I experimentally know that it is to my
               dearest mother I owe the great protecting influence which actually preserves me from
               the delusive dangers of this dominion of pleasure. It is the talisman which she has
               hung around my heart, that protects me from the magic influence of the fashionable
               world, and keeps the demons of the <span class="emph">ton</span> from succeeding in
               their mischiefs against me. </span></p>
         <p><span class="letter">I maintain the habitual solicitude to unfold my secret thoughts to
               you,--and that anxiety increases in proportion as they may deviate, however trifling
               that deviation may be, from the native purity to which you have formed the mind of
               your daughter;--and I must acknowledge, my dearest mother, that there have been
               moments, I trust they were only moments, when I have felt myself infected by the
               influenza of pleasure. When such powerful attacks are made by the united efforts of
               wealth, art, and taste on the youthful heart, and worked up and prepared as they are
               by the genii of fashion, they are not to be resisted by common means or with ordinary
               auxiliaries. Many of the <span class="emph">fetes</span> that are given in this great
               town, would answer to the description of allegorical poetry. I have been present at
               scenes of luxurious entertainment, in a street of London, which might have been
               represented by the inventive muse of such a poet as Spenser, as a bower of pleasure,
               formed by the ministers of that goddess to charm, to delude, and, I had almost said,
               to destroy. The sounds of delicious music, the voices of the singing men and the
               singing women, the animating gaiety of the dance, the elegant splendour of
               decoration, in which invention is exhausted, and the luxury of the banquet:--these,
               when combined with the brilliant display of company, in all the allurements of dress,
               with joy in every heart, and smiles on every countenance:--when a mind is so prepared
               by expectation for enjoyment, and the enjoyment is sanctioned by the presence of
               those, whose authority may be thought to sanction every thing of which they
               themselves partake;--with such a <span class="emph">cornucopia</span> of pleasure
               poured forth before them, how is it possible for the young and the gay to resist the
               fascination?--And when they follow quick one upon another, and form a kind of routine
               of pleasure; it is a subject for wonder, that the mind should be relaxed into
               dissipation, and that habits should succeed, which, to say no worse, belie the
               understanding? </span></p>
         <p><span class="letter">I must confess, my dearest mother, that I, your Eliza, have found
               myself in a delirium, where I will not say my reason has been lost,--but where I have
               suffered a partial intoxication of it. I have been in a situation where I have
               thought of nothing but the delusive objects around me; where my spirits have felt a
               new and a delightful kind of exhilaration;--where every serious thought was banished,
               and all reflection lost in a kind of wild sensation of joy. But while I acknowledge
               the passing dream, I declare my perfect subjection to the talismanic power which
               could disperse it in a moment. If, in a far wilder state of joyous hurry than I have
               ever been, any one had whispered one certain magic word--as by an electric shock, the
               dream would have vanished in an instant, the gaudy coruscations of fancied joy would
               pass away like the meteors of the air, and all my better thoughts and purest
               sentiments, which had been affrighted, as it were, from their native abode, would
               rally back to it, and smile in triumph there.--Need I add, that this magic word is,
               MOTHER. </span></p>
         <p><span class="letter">I have a proof at hand.--</span></p>
         <p><span class="letter">The night before last I was at one of these entertainments, where,
               amidst all its elegance, there was good sense enough employed, to render the number
               of the company conformable to the dimensions of the apartments; a proportion which is
               too seldom observed: so that to all the fine epithets which might have been
               appropriately applied to it, that of <span class="emph">comfortable</span> might be
               superadded. Here, I happened to be seated at supper in the midst of my acquaintance;
               and gay we were as gay could be, and I was among the gayest of them. When Lady
               Elizabeth <span class="longdash">-----</span>, whose vivacity had helped to
               exhilarate me, exclaimed, on a sudden, "Vittoria! Vittoria! The town has conquered
               the country at last, and my dear Amelia will now prefer blanched almonds to
               acorns.--Henceforward, I perceive, she will leave the country oaks to the country
               pigs."--This exclamation sobered me in a moment. The idea of the oaks bore me at once
               to that venerable mansion which is shaded by them, and to my dearest mother, who is
               the inhabitant of it. So I instantly looked at my watch, and hastened to join my
               aunt, with whom I remained till it was time to depart. </span></p>
         <p><span class="letter">But even, if this awakening circumstance had not happened, there
               was a superior power behind, which would have effectually recovered me from any
               foolish impressions, fanciful reveries, or giddy thoughts; and that is the last act
               of each day's life before I retire to rest. This duty, which has been, from my infant
               years, so habitual to me, and has never ceased to be enforced by you, as a most
               essential and sacred office, to the moment of my last departure from you, is an
               admirable specific in folly, a fine restorative in weakness, a soothing calmant of
               passion, and a benign protection from evil. After the solemn performance of this
               pious, pleasing rite, I feel, whatever has formed the enjoyment of the preceding day,
               as if I had never been from your side. </span></p>
         <p><span class="letter">But to return to my subject.--These entertainments are produced by
               vanity alone. They cannot possibly be traced to any other origin. A gentleman, where
               we were visiting this morning, having given the description of some very fine house
               which was lately finished, a lady instantly exclaimed,--"O that the house were mine,
               for I would then have all London at my feet!--I would give such a gala as should fill
               my porter's book with every name of title and consequence in the court calendar."--It
               is, indeed, this love of fashionable consequence alone which gives birth to these
               splendid assemblies. Friendship cannot have the least concern in it; for it often
               happens, that half the company at least which attend these solemnities, are not known
               to the priestess who presides at the alter, while the good man who pays for the
               hecatombs is only considered as one of the croud of votaries; and if, on the very
               next day, he were met by such of the company with whom he had not a previous
               acquaintance, he would scarcely be considered as a subject for recognition, if they
               happened to know his person, which it is more than probable might not be the case
               with many of them: so that what begins in vanity, as far as my observation extends,
               or my intelligence reaches, ends in vexation of spirit. I will relate to you, for
               your amusement, a curious example of fashionable folly which enlivened and amused the
               circles of fashion during the last spring. </span></p>
         <p><span class="letter">A very opulent citizen, who was already a member of parliament, had
               the ambition to figure as a man of fashion. He accordingly took a very fine house at
               this end of the town, and having fitted it up in a very splendid manner, the next
               step was to collect a society suitable to it. This, he understood, was to be
               accomplished by his <span class="emph">cara sposa's</span> elegant parties; and he
               determined to begin by a masquerade, whose <span class="emph">eclat</span> was to
               induce the leading characters of the <span class="emph">ton</span> to appear at his
               door. The preparations for this superb entertainment were carefully announced by all
               fashionable means; and cards of admission were issued to all the recorded visitors,
               and such members of the House of Commons to whom parliamentary business had made him
               known, with a few persons of title, &amp;c. to which the accidental jostle of summer
               watering-places had introduced him, so that altogether there was a promise of a
               pretty sprinkle of company for the present season, while the whole fashionable world
               would thus be decoyed for the following winter. A noble lord, however, who was a
               perfect stranger to the parties, having an inclination to partake of the festivity,
               sent a card of requisition for half a dozen tickets for himself and family. This
               circumstance rather alarmed the pride and lessened the consequence of both the
               gentleman and the lady: and an answer was accordingly returned, that the cards of
               admission were confined to those names which were found in the porter's book. This
               piece of pride had well nigh proved too fatal to the splendour of the entertainment;
               for it was very soon found, that in consequence of this refusal, there was an
               absolute canvas making among the persons of fashion, who had been invited, to prevent
               their accepting the invitation; so that no alternative was left but to admit all the
               world to the <span class="emph">fete</span>, or to waste its magnificence on the
               small circle of their own acquaintance. The former, of course, was preferred, and as
               the invitations now flew all over the town, all the town flew to them; and this gala
               was the most splendid shew of the season. But as this gentleman had been in the habit
               of calculating profit and loss, he recurred to it on the present occasion, and
               determined it should be his first and last venture in the commerce of fashionable
               life. </span></p>
         <p><span class="letter">A lady, a Mrs. B<span class="longdash">-----</span> , a very
               pleasing, amiable woman, a Tunbridge acquaintance of my aunt's, amused us exceedingly
               last night, by giving, with great good-humour and pleasantry, an account of a similar
               folly of her own. Mr. B<span class="longdash">-----</span> had made a very large
               fortune in the East Indies, and, on their return to England to enjoy it, made their
               winter residence in a very handsome house in one of the squares; and, having made
               acquaintance with a broken-down woman of fashion at Bath, this new friend persuaded
               Mrs. B<span class="longdash">-----</span> to introduce herself at once into high
               life, by giving a ball and supper to a select party; and she undertook that it should
               be attended by the persons of the first distinction. Nor did she fail of
               accomplishing her promise: but none of these high people would engage to attend it
               unless they had a certain number of cards to distribute among their own particular
               friends. The conditions could not be refused, and they amounted, altogether, to one
               hundred and seventy; so that poor dear Mrs. B, whose house, according to the style of
               the entertainment, would not accommodate more than one hundred and eighty persons,
               could only admit ten persons to her ball whom she had ever spoken to before. The
               great folks, it is true, curtsied most gracefully to her, as they entered the
               apartments; and, on their departure, they thanked her, with great cordiality, for the
               delightful party, and hoped she would favour them with just such another the next
               winter; and this, with the liberty of leaving her name at their doors, was all she
               got for the five hundred pounds lavished on the occasion. To which, indeed, she
               observed, might be added, the reproaches and ridicule of her own private friends and
               acquaintance, who were necessarily excluded. To repair, however, the disgrace among
               the latter, she gives another ball to them alone; and to invite us to it, was the
               object of her visit. "And such," says she, "has been the beginning, and will be the
               end, of my chapter in the chronicles of fashion." </span></p>
         <p><span class="letter">As I am upon the subject of these assemblies, and my paper will
               allow me, I will mention one more, and which was to the full as curious as those
               which I have just described. It was a ball and supper given by Lady D, and in the
               first place, three times as many people were invited as the house could possibly
               accommodate in the way of supper; and, therefore, three suppers were prepared, which
               were to succeed each other. This was a contrivance, as you will perceive, of special
               promise, and it answered fully to its engagement. The drawing-room apartments were
               very soon so completely crouded, that dancing was impracticable, and was not even
               attempted. So much for the ball: and when the first supper was announced, the company
               who crouded the staircase, being nearest at hand, took possession of it, and your
               daughter was one of them: and in consequence of the accession of fresh arrivals, not
               only every room, but every avenue, was so entirely filled up, that not a plate could
               be changed, or a decanter replenished with water; as the servants, from this
               extraordinary pressure, were completely excluded from the scene of their duty; so
               that while the gay folks without were clamouring for something to eat, those within
               were equally clamourous for something to drink; and thus we remained immovable and
               half stifled, till a large portion of the company had taken their leave. In short,
               when the second supper was served, there was no one left to eat it. And thus ended
               the splendid scene of waste, folly, and extravagance, without having afforded
               satisfaction to an human being but the cooks and confectioners who had provided it.
               The lady of the house, as I have heard, sat up stairs crying with vexation, and had
               the satisfaction of hearing herself and her arrangements treated with the most
               unceremonious disapprobation. At five in the morning we returned home, and except a
               few rents in my dress, which, indeed, amounted to a total demolition of it, I
               suffered no inconvenience. My friend, lady Elizabeth <span class="longdash"
                  >-----</span>, caught a violent cold; and, when I found her in that affliction, it
               was impossible for me not to renew my warfare with her, on the topic of a town life,
               its rational pleasures, and delightful consequences: when she abused me for my
               robust, vulgar, country health; and said she had now lost all hopes of my ever
               acquiring the elegant languor of a woman of fashion. That is an improvement, which I,
               most certainly, do not wish to attain; and I trust, that when I shall return to my
               native home, my dear and ever honoured mother will find me, in every respect, what I
               was whe she last embraced her most dutiful and affectionate </span></p>
