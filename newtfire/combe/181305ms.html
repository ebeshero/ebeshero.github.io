         <p><span>Among the peculiar characteristics of modern literature, if literature it may be
               called, is the employment of long words and bombastic expressions; beneath which, the
               ignorance of many of those who call themselves literary men, contrives, among the
               class of their readers, to lie concealed. So that they can work up a sentence into
               what they call splendour of expression, their object is attained. The justness of the
               thought, the truth of the observation, or the rectitude of the opinion, had little
               weight with them. When a common-place remark is thus elevated on stilts, and a vulgar
               notion, which a few monosyllables might express, is clothes in a gorgeous robe of
               what <span class="persName">Ben Jonson</span> calls <span class="emph">Foot and
                  half-foot words</span>, then the pride of fine writing is enjoyed by the fine
               writers to whom I allude. But the vexation of my mind on the occasion, does not arise
               so much from the folly of those who write, for they are paid fo it, as the ignorance
               of those who read, and consequently encourage them; or rather that there should be so
               large a class of readers so little advanced beyond a state of ignorance, as to
               encourage such writers. I have sometimes suspected, that the body of printers were at
               the bottom of this style of writing, as it is a very important change in their
               favour: it would have been very well worth their while to have given a premium, and a
               handsome one too, to the writer who, in a certain number of sheets, had demonstrated
               the happier knack at deviation from simplicity of style and intelligent expression,
               into exuberant expansion of cogitation, perturbation of imagery, figurative
               distortions of phraseology, and the adaptation of the greatest number of words from
               the <span class="emph">New London Spelling Book’s</span> catalogue of such as are of
               five and six syllables. I shall not surely be contradicted in my opinion, that if a
               Spectator of <span class="persName">Mr. Addison</span> (I, of course, mean the
               subject of it,) were given to one of the professors of the high modern <span
                  class="emph">slang</span>, to re-write, he would contrive to wire-draw it into
               three times its present length. The elegance, the precision, and the simple grace of
               the original, would probably be overwhelmed by the accumulation of prolongated
               expressions; but then the augmentation of letter-press would be effectually obtained.
            </span></p>
         <p><span>It was a saying of <span class="persName">Charles II.</span> that there was no
               fool so great, but he might find a greater fool to admire him; and to that
               consolation I leave the class of writers who have called forth these observations, I
               must beg leave, at the same time, to declare, as an act of justice, that I do not
               suppose any of them to be concerned in the advertisements of the <span class="emph"
                  >puffing</span> auctioneers, &amp;c. and the dictatorial information of their
               catalogues, as it is evident that they are their own scribes. But to proceed to the
               letter which has occasioned the preceding remarks: whether it is written in solemn
               belief, that its style is in conformity to what the best critics have considered as
               elegant, simple, and impressive; whether the writer has given it as an example of
               what he has worked up in his imagination, to suppose the true, ardent mode of
               epistolary writing; or whether he wishes to quiz the affectation of adapting
               high-sounding expressions to common thoughts, or long words to short sentiments, I do
               not presume to enquire. But be the motive to this composition what it may, I am
               disposed to think that its uncommon and happy arrangement of pleasing expressions
               will entertain others as it has amused me. </span></p>

            <p><span class="letter">TO THE MODERN SPECTATOR. PARLIAMENT-COURT, Artillery-place,
                  Aldersgate street. SIR,</span></p>
            <p><span class="letter">The association between the accumulations of science, the
                  scintillations of wit, and the coruscations of genius, which are so perceptible in
                  your monthly effusions, together with that graciousness o encouragement which you
                  manifest with such a characteristic liberality, have induced me to exert my
                  consolidated powers of ratiocination, in order to produce such a combination of
                  grave disquisitions and animating sentimentalities, as may not only be favoured
                  with your distinguishing reception, but be honoured also with your flattering
                  felicitation. </span></p>
            <p><span class="letter">Epistolary lucubrations, I well know, should be written in
                  strict conformity to nature; because nothing but a strict conformity to nature can
                  render any composition beautiful or just: and a departure from familiarity of
                  language can only be justified on occasions not familiar. Whatever elevates the
                  sentiments, will consequently elevate the expressions, and proportionate images
                  will arise at the call of our respective thoughts in characteristic succession and
                  quality. These are the predominating regulations by which, as you must have
                  already observed, I am uniformly governed and influenced in the conformation of my
                  style, and the infusing into it that unbounded vigour which, without any
                  precipitancy of thought, I shall venture to say, is an indubitable and
                  propitiating feature of my writing. </span></p>
            <p><span class="letter">In addressing myself to you, <span class="persName">Mr.
                     Spectator</span>, I most solemnly swear by Dionysius Halicarnassus, that I have
                  made no accumulation of preparatory phrases, but have let my thoughts expand in an
                  easy familiar course of investigation, suited to the taste of such polished and
                  fashionable readers as I suppose your’s to be. At present, however, I shall wave
                  any regular and systematic communication to you as I shall wait to know whether
                  this exemplar of my pen creates a votive inclination to have me for a
                  correspondent. I live in the country, as the agreeablements of rurality are most
                  congenial to my dispositions. Nothing is so delectable to me, as a ruminating
                  perambulation beneath overspreading ramifications and intricate interlacements of
                  a corresponding accumulation of umbrageous beauty. Thus becanopied I sit and
                  think, far remote from the ambiguities, impracticabilities, and meteorous
                  pleasures of what is called the world. The turmoil of this metropolitan city I
                  shall leave the day after morrow, and shall expect your notification with great
                  impatience, in your next number, whether my meditations are to be condensed in any
                  of your future pages. I beg you will permit me to conclude with a sonorous,
                  comprehensive, and respectful declaration, that I am your most obedient, humble
                  servant, </span></p>

         <p><span>I think it right to insert the following letter, though I am by no means qualified
               to answer the query. If my correspondent has a fancy for a lawsuit, and wishes to
               keep a court of justice in a roar of laughter, let him transfer the question from me
               to the first attorney he meets, and he will be completely gratified. </span></p>

            <p><span class="letter">TO THE MODERN SPECTATOR. <span class="placeName"
                     >FINSBURY-SQUARE.</span> SIR, </span></p>
            <p><span class="letter">I am a respectable wholesale dealer in the city, and having
                  taken my son into partnership, I can now and then spare a few weeks to go to the
                  sea-side, as salt water has been successfully recommended to me for a scorbutic
                  habit of body, with which I have been afflicted for some years, and is sometimes
                  attended with very unpleasant effects. The symptoms appearing about three months
                  ago, which turned my attention to the sea-coast, I went to the inn to take a place
                  in the stage-coach for <span class="placeName">Worthing</span>: the places,
                  however, being taken for a fortnight to come, I was ruminating in what manner I
                  should proceed; when a well looking, smiling gentleman came into the coach-office
                  to make a similar enquiry. Our mutual disappointment brought on a conversation,
                  which ended in an agreement to hire a post-chaise to take us throughout our
                  journey. </span></p>
            <p><span class="letter">On the day appointed we accordingly set out, and our first stage
                  passed very agreeably, for he was one of the funniest men I ever saw in my life
                  and had something pleasant to say to every one with whom we had the least
                  communication. But our harmony began to suffer an interruption on remounting the
                  chaise after we had stopped to breakfast. I had been for so many years accustomed
                  to take my pipe, which I had nothing to do, that I could not give it up on the
                  present occasion, and my smoking in the chaise brought on some pretty sharp
                  remonstrances. I was also in the habit of taking <span class="emph"
                     >assifoetida</span> pills, and their accidental effects added to his
                  discontents; but as the chaise was paid for to our journey’s end, I knew he could
                  not help himself; and, on my telling him, that a companion in a post-chaise, was
                  taken like a companion for life, for better and for worse, he said, he had not
                  thought of that, and seemed to be satisfied. We had not, however, proceeded above
                  a couple of miles, when I perceived something rather queer in his appearance; and,
                  on enquiring into the cause of it, he told me, with a melancholy look, not to be
                  alarmed, but that he had unfortunately been bit by a dog who was supposed to be
                  mad; and was advised by the physician of <span class="placeName">Bedlam
                     Hospital</span> to go to the sea-side for the benefit of bathing in salt water,
                  as a preventive of his going mad himself. He, however, with a kind of hesitating
                  speech, entreated me to suppress my fears, and assured me, that I might be quite
                  at my ease, and need not apprehend any mischief till he began to bark like a dog,
                  of which he did not feel any immediate symptoms. This intelligence, however, put
                  an end to my smoking, and while I was thinking what was to be done, we came to a
                  brook, when I perceived he began to roll his eyes and grind his teeth; and just as
                  we got into the middle of the stream, he set up a barking just like our
                  Newfoundland mastiff, <span class="persName">Caesar</span>; when I opened the
                  chaise-door, and thinking it better to risk the being drowned, than being mad, I
                  made but one step into the water; when he, in a rage, threw my cloak-bag after me,
                  but as he did not seem disposed to follow, I loudly told the post-boy to take him
                  away as fast as he could, and not trouble himself any further about <span
                     class="emph">me</span>. I took refuge in a neighbouring inn, where I staid
                  three days before I was sufficiently recovered from my fright and my sousing, to
                  resume my journey. At length, I took the opportunity of a stage-coach, and arrived
                  safe at my journey’s end. Having smoked a couple of pipes after dinner, and taken
                  my usual quantity of wine, and being withal tired of my own company, I went to the
                  play, and on entering the theatre, who should I see performing the character of
                     <span class="persName">Romeo</span>, but my mad companion in the post-chaise!
                  This was a perfect mystery to me; but the waiter at the inn unraveled it. The
                  story had got to <span class="placeName">Worthing</span> before me, and was the
                  conversation of the place; for it turned out, that this impudent player, to get
                  rid, as he said, of my tobacco and assifoetida pills, had feigned himself mad to
                  have the chaise to himself. But this was not all,--I was a subject of laughter
                  wherever I went; and the saucy boys of the place thought it good fun to begin
                  barking whenever I appeared. It is scarcely credible, but the vagabond of an actor
                  had the impudence to solicit me to take some tickets for his benefit, though he
                  had announced as part of the entertainments, the celebrated song of <span
                     class="emph">Bow, wow, wow</span>. In short, I found it absolutely necessary
                  for my comfort to remove to <span class="placeName">Brighton</span>. </span></p>
            <p><span class="letter">Surely, If there is law or justice in the country, I shall be
                  able to make this audacious fellow pay for his tricks. As you appear to be a
                  person of superior knowledge, you may be able to advise me on the subject, without
                  having a professional interest to answer. In so doing, you will greatly oblige
