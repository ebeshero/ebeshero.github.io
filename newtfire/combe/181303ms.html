         <p><span>In my opinion, woman's true dowry is virtue, modesty, and desires restrained, and
               not the mere money which is usually understood by that expression. </span></p>
         <p><span>I have often considered, that the class of females which are denominated <span
                  class="emph">Old Maids</span>, are in general treated with the most unsparing and
               unceremonious injustice. That many of them are to be found who are envious and
               malignant, I do not deny; but, at the same time, I am by no means disposed to
               attribute such unpleasant dispositions exclusively to their unmarried state; because
               I could produce, at any time, an equal proportion of married women with similar
               offensive habits, and who obsessing, from their particular condition, a more extended
               sphere of action, are proportionably more mischievous in the indulgence of them. Nor
               do I hesitate to declare, that I would much rather, were I a woman, have what is
               called a spiteful Old Maid for my enemy, than a married woman who has three
               marriageable daughters; as the former has only her own disappointments to resent,
               while the latter has the envious and discontented impulse in a threefold proportion.
               I could give many delightful examples of disinterestedness and benevolence in ladies
               who have been destined to a life of celibacy; and, I the thought had before occurred
               to me, I might have indulged myself at large in a lucubration on the subject; but the
               following letter from a lady of that character, affording such an example of good
               sense, knowledge of the world, and disinterested benevolence, precludes me from
               offering any information of my own on the subject. I have only to anticipate the
               approbation of all my readers, in contemplating a plan which is so pregnant with
               advantage to that class of young women who stand most in need of support, protection,
               and introduction: I mean those whose persons are attractive, whose accomplishments
               aid the attraction, and whom fortune has never befriended, or has unhappily deserted.
               The proposed arrangement receives my most hearty concurrence, and my pleasure in
               announcing it to the world can be second only to that which would accompany the
               seeing it carried into effect. No one who reads it will hereafter deny, that an Old
               Maid is capable of the most friendly, generous, and kindly interesting conduct to the
               young, the lovely, and the accomplished of her own sex. </span></p>

            <p><span class="letter">TO THE MODERN SPECTATOR, IN MR. ACKERMANN'S REPOSITORY OF ARTS,
                  &amp;c. SIR, </span></p>
            <p><span class="letter">--I have long and repeatedly determined to address you on the
                  subject of a plan I have in contemplation, and which I now offer to your serious,
                  attentive, and, as I flatter myself, favourable, regard. But before it will be
                  possible for you to give a judicious opinion on the subject, it will be
                  essentially necessary for you to become acquainted with the leading circumstances
                  of my past life, and from what source those motives have arisen which have induced
                  me to engage in a correspondence with you. </span></p>
            <p><span class="letter">You may smile, perhaps, and some of your readers may follow your
                  example, when I assure you, that I am by no means ashamed of being an OLD
                  MAID--such is my present situation, and my origin I shall very briefly tell you.
               </span></p>
            <p><span class="letter">I am the daughter of an officer in the army, who left me so
                  little that it can scarcely be called a fortune; and as for beauty, that kind of
                  personal property was pretty much upon a par with my real possessions. All I shall
                  say of my figure is, that it did not want height, as I was upwards of six feet
                  high, without the elevating aid of pattens. My father, however, for he was the
                  best of men, though he was disappointed of that promotion which he well deserved,
                  having attained no higher rank than that of a captain, contrived to give me an
                  excellent education, observing at the same time, that, in so doing, he <span
                     class="emph">gave me what the world could not take from me</span> (a remark
                  replete with wisdom). Among other things, he taught me landscape and figure
                  drawing, in which he himself excelled; while my mother instructed me in the useful
                  arts of needle-work, weaving lace, &amp;c. which were enlivened with music and the
                  song. </span></p>
            <p><span class="letter">When I was about twenty-one, the rude hand of fate deprived me
                  of both my parents in one little month. My father died with his sword in his hand
                  on the field of battle; and my mother, who loved him to excess, had not the
                  strength to sustain the affliction of such a loss, and soon sunk into her grave.
               </span></p>
            <p><span class="letter">No relation was now left me but an aunt, who had lived with us
                  for some years. She was the widow of a bookseller in <span class="placeName"
                     >London</span>, who had left her something more than fifty pounds a year. As
                  for myself, two hundred pounds were all that my father's honourable patrimony
                  could save for me. This small sum, however, I put out to interest, and, with the
                  approbation of my aunt, I determined to try what my pencil, my needle, and my
                  lace-pillow would do for me. This determination was attended with success far
                  beyond my expectations; and I acquired that degree of character in thus employing
                  the talents I possessed, that a gentlewoman, who kept a school for young ladies in
                  the neighborhood, made me such an offer to assist her in the conduct and
                  management of it, that I immediately engaged in the undertaking. Thus, I was not
                  only enabled to live in a comfortable manner, but to save al little money. In
                  short, I conducted myself with so much satisfaction to Madame de Brazille, the
                  lady governess of the school, that, after having had the goodness to treat me with
                  the affection of a mother, she closed her life with the same parental disposition,
                  by leaving me her school, the house in which it was carried on, with all its
                  furniture, plate, and apparatus for instruction, including also five acres of land
                  at the distance of thirty miles from <span class="placeName">London</span>.
               </span></p>
            <p><span class="letter">At the head of this respectable establishment I continued till I
                  found myself worth five hundred pounds a year. I was at this time about
                  fifty-five, an age when it was natural for me to wish to retire from the bustle of
                  life; in which, by my own application, and with the blessing of a beneficent
                  Creator, I had succeeded so well. I accordingly sold my house, my school, and all
                  their contents, to a young lady, the orphan daughter of an officer, whom I had
                  educated, and who fortunately had been left a sufficiency to make the purchase.
                  This circumstance added considerably to my income, and having reserved the five
                  adjoining acres already mentioned, I built a neat small cottage there; so that I
                  am close to my old abode, which I frequently visit, and where I am always received
                  and treated as a mother. </span></p>
            <p><span class="letter">In this pleasing and comfortable retreat I reside during eight
                  months of the year, and during the other four I pay a visit to the metropolis: but
                  as, from my former habits of incessant occupation, I feel a vacancy in this part
                  of my life, I wish to fill it up as I can. In short, I am anxious to have
                  something to do, and to let that something be to the advantage of my own sex. I
                  propose, therefore, to establish an EXHIBITION, on the following plan, whose
                  ultimate tendency will not be suspected of originating in the mind of an Old Maid.
                  But so it is. </span></p>
            <p><span class="letter">In the first place, I propose to fit up, in an appropriate
                  manner, the first floor of a handsome house, in a fashionable part of the town,
                  for the reception of works of art by those young women of respectable families,
                  whose situation requires the support of their own exertions, whether in the
                  different branches of design and painting, or in the ornamental works of personal
                  decoration and elegant utility; such as embroidery, laces, worsted works, and
                  other decorations of fancy. A little of the supposed stiffness and starchness of
                  the old maid may, however, be thought to appear, when I mention, that every one of
                  my female exhibitors must accompany their productions with the most satisfactory
                  testimonials of their character, conduct, and connections; but as my plan is not
                  only to encourage, but to reward merit, it is essentially necessary, that the fair
                  deserts of the candidates should be clearly established. Such an arrangement will
                  then be made, that visitors may be received to view the exhibition; and the prices
                  being fixed to every article, there will be no difficulty in the disposal to such
                  as may be inclined to become purchasers of them. This part of my plan, however
                  useful it may prove, is on the principle of accommodation, which has already been
                  adopted and successfully executed. The new and, as I conceive, original part of my
                  plan, is yet to be displayed. </span></p>
            <p><span class="letter">I propose that one of my rooms shall be altogether appropriated
                  to portraits, which must be of such young ladies as are qualified to produce them
                  by their own efforts in that branch of art: and here my plan will proceed a step
                  further, Mr. Spectator, than I presume you are prepared to expect, and which, I
                  trust, the most scrupulous of my sisterhood of old maidens, over the worst dish of
                  tea in England, will not be disposed to censure. It is my opinion, which I think
                  will not be controverted by any reflecting and experienced mind, that a young lady
                  of respectable family, agreeable person, amiable manners, and suitable
                  accomplishments, though of a circumscribed fortune, is worthy the attention of,
                  and a becoming match for any gentleman. Now if such an one should, from the
                  impression made on him by any one of these portraits, feel himself disposed to
                  present himself in a matrimonial capacity, he must then send me his portrait,
                  which, with an account of himself and his circumstances, I will transmit to the
                  lady who is the object of his admiration; and, if they are approved by herself and
                  her friends, her address shall be communicated to him, when he may present himself
                  in person, and prefer his suit. I perceive nothing romantic in all this. It is the
                  way in which George III. obtained his queen, and I do not see what objection any
                  of his loyal subjects can have to follow his Majesty's royal example. A more happy
                  marriage has seldom been seen or known, than of the royal pair, which was produced
                  by the interchange of their pictures. </span></p>
            <p><span class="letter">Thus, sir, I should hope to advance that state in which I have
                  never engaged myself, but whose felicity I am anxious to promote in others, and in
                  this way, at least, to answer the ends of my creation. </span></p>
            <p><span class="letter">Such is my plan for the promotion of domestic happiness and
                  national strength, which I hope will meet not only with your approbation, but also
                  with your co-operating assistance. Some of your ingenious correspondents may,
                  perhaps, furnish hints for the improvement and enlargement of my design; and I
                  shall thank them, with great sincerity, for their attention to this most
                  interesting, and consequently most important subject. </span></p>
            <p><span class="letter">Nothing is now, I think, left me to do, but inform you, that I
                  am known, by my friends, under the name of <span class="persName">Beacham</span>;
                  but though, from its orthography, it might be mistaken for that of a foreigner,
                  our family have lived on the borders of Scotland for many centuries. </span></p>
            <p><span class="letter">I remain, with great admiration of <span class="persName">Mr.
                     Ackermann</span>'s <span class="emph">Repository</span>, your most obedient and
