         <p>NOTE</p>
         <p>This Issue is founded on the Edition published by R. Ackermann in the</p>
         <p>year 1822</p>
         <p>HISTORY</p>
         <p>OF</p>
         <p>QUÆ GENUS, ETC.</p>
         <p>The favour which has been bestowed on the different TOURS OF DOCTOR</p>
         <p>SYNTAX, has encouraged the Writer of them to give a HISTORY OF THE</p>
         <p>FOUNDLING, who has been thought an interesting Object in the latter of</p>
         <p>those Volumes; and it is written in the same style and manner, with a</p>
         <p>view to connect it with them.</p>
         <p>This Child of Chance, it is presumed, is led through a track of Life</p>
         <p>not unsuited to the peculiarity of his Condition and Character, while</p>
         <p>its varieties, as in the former Works, are represented by the Pencil</p>
         <p>of MR. ROWLANDSON with its accustomed characteristic Felicity.</p>
         <p>The Idea of an English GIL BLAS predominated through the whole of this</p>
         <p>Volume; which must be considered as fortunate in no common degree, if</p>
         <p>its readers, in the course of their perusal, should be disposed to</p>
         <p>acknowledge even a remote Similitude to the incomparable Work of _Le</p>
         <p>Sage_.</p>
         <p>The AUTHOR.</p>
         <p>PREFACE</p>
         <p>This prolonged work is, at length, brought to a close.--It has grown</p>
         <p>to this size, under rare and continuing marks of public favour; while</p>
         <p>the same mode of Composition has been employed in the last, as in the</p>
         <p>former Volumes. They are all equally indebted to MR. ROWLANDSON'S</p>
         <p>talents.</p>
         <p>It may, perhaps, be considered as presumption in me, and at my age, to</p>
         <p>sport even with my own Dowdy Muse, but, from the extensive patronage</p>
         <p>which DOCTOR SYNTAX has received, it may be presumed that, more or</p>
         <p>less, he has continued to amuse: And I, surely, have no reason to be</p>
         <p>dissatisfied, when Time points at my eightieth Year, that I can still</p>
         <p>afford some pleasure to those who are disposed to be pleased.</p>

         <p>THE HISTORY</p>
         <p>OF</p>
         <p>JOHNNY QUÆ GENUS</p>
         <p>OR</p>
         <p id="ca1">The Foundling of Doctor Syntax</p>
         <p>CANTO I</p>
         <p>Johnny Quæ Genus! what a name</p>
         <p>To offer to the voice of Fame!</p>
         <p>(Though she 'tis hop'd may condescend</p>
         <p>To act as Little Johnny's friend)</p>
         <p>This may be said, when first the eye</p>
         <p>Does, by a careless glance, descry</p>
         <p>The striking range of marshall'd words</p>
         <p>Which a gay TITLE-PAGE affords.</p>
         <p>But what's a name, as SHAKESPEARE says,</p>
         <p>It neither gives nor lessens praise;</p>
         <p>Adds no fresh odour to the rose,</p>
         <p>Nor any other flower that blows:</p>
         <p>Whether with rare or common name</p>
         <p>The fragrance will be just the same.</p>
         <p>'Tis not a title can confer</p>
         <p>The good or ill of character,</p>
         <p>_HOWARDS_ have been both beat and bang'd,</p>
         <p>And some with ancient names been hang'd:</p>
         <p>Look at a ship with convicts stor'd</p>
         <p>What noble names are oft on board!</p>
         <p>It is the living, current course</p>
         <p>Or of the better or the worse,</p>
         <p>That stamps, whate'er may be the name,</p>
         <p>Or with a good or evil fame.</p>
         <p>But howsoe'er the thing we view</p>
         <p>Our little Johnny's title's new:</p>
         <p>Or for the child or for the man,</p>
         <p>In an old phrase, 'tis _spick_ and _span_.</p>
         <p>Besides, as most folk do agree</p>
         <p>To find a charm in novelty,</p>
         <p>'Tis the first time that Grammar rule</p>
         <p>Which makes boys tremble when at school,</p>
         <p>Did with the name an union crave</p>
         <p>Which at the font a sponsor gave.</p>
         <p>But whether 'twas in hum'rous mood</p>
         <p>Or by some classic whim pursued,</p>
         <p>Or as, in Eton's Grammar known,</p>
         <p>It bore relation to his own,</p>
         <p>Syntax, it was at Whitsuntide,</p>
         <p>And a short time before he died,</p>
         <p>In pleasant humour, after dinner,</p>
         <p>Surnam'd, in wine, the little sinner.</p>
         <p>And thus, amid the table's roar, }</p>
         <p>Gave him from good, old _Lilly's_ store, }</p>
         <p>A name which none e'er had before. }</p>
         <p>--'Squire Worthy, who, perchance was there,</p>
         <p>Promis'd the Doctor's wish to share,</p>
         <p>That want, at least might not annoy</p>
         <p>The progress of the Foundling Boy.</p>
         <p>"--Syntax," He said, "We'll try between us</p>
         <p>To make the fortune of QUÆ GENUS:</p>
         <p>You feed his mind with learning's food,</p>
         <p>And I'll protect him if he's good."</p>
         <p>"While I," said smiling _Dickey Bend_,</p>
         <p>"Will add my mite as _Johnny's_ friend;</p>
         <p>Nor shall he want the scraps of knowledge</p>
         <p>Which he can pick up at my College."</p>
         <p>--Thus, as they did the bumper ply</p>
         <p>To Johnny's future destiny,</p>
         <p>The warm, almost parental heart</p>
         <p>Of Mrs. Syntax bore its part;</p>
         <p>And her cheek wore a smile of joy</p>
         <p>As she beheld th' unconscious boy,</p>
         <p>Who, careless of the kind debate,</p>
         <p>Play'd with the cherries on his plate.</p>
         <p>But such is life's uncertain hour,</p>
         <p>And such is fate's tyrannic power,</p>
         <p>That while our comforts smile around</p>
         <p>The fatal dart inflicts the wound:</p>
         <p>Thus e'er another month was past</p>
         <p>Syntax, alas! had breath'd his last.</p>
         <p>Whene'er he heard the widow sigh</p>
         <p>QUÆ GENUS wept he scarce knew why:</p>
         <p>Of a kind friend fate had bereft him,</p>
         <p>And an odd name was all he left him.</p>
         <p>His urchin fancy only thought</p>
         <p>As his enquiring mind was taught,</p>
         <p>That his adopted sire was gone</p>
         <p>Where the good go to worlds unknown,</p>
         <p>To happy regions plac'd on high</p>
         <p>Above the blue and starry sky,</p>
         <p>Where, he was with the hope endued,</p>
         <p>That he should go, if he were good.</p>
         <p>But the good lady took him home</p>
         <p>And kept him many a year to come;</p>
         <p>When he grew up a charming youth,</p>
         <p>In whom simplicity and truth</p>
         <p>Did o'er his ev'ry thought preside;</p>
         <p>While, with such an anxious guide,</p>
         <p>Life smil'd and seem'd to promise fair,</p>
         <p>That it would answer to the care</p>
         <p>Which her affection had bestow'd,</p>
         <p>To set him on his future road:</p>
         <p>But when she died poor John was hurl'd</p>
         <p>Into a bustling, tricking world.</p>
         <p>He had, 'tis true, all she could leave;</p>
         <p>She gave him all there was to give;</p>
         <p>Of all she had she made him heir,</p>
         <p>But left it to a lawyer's care:</p>
         <p>No wonder then that he was cheated</p>
         <p>And her fond anxious hopes defeated:</p>
         <p>So that instead of his possessing</p>
         <p>The fruits of her last, dying blessing;</p>
         <p>He had, as it turn'd out, to rue }</p>
         <p>What foul rascality could do; }</p>
         <p>And his own wild vagaries too. }</p>
         <p>Here, gentle reader, here begins</p>
         <p>The account of our young Hero's sins:</p>
         <p>But all which thus far form'd his fate,</p>
         <p>QUÆ GENUS will himself relate,</p>
         <p>And what truth bids him to rehearse,</p>
         <p>My hum-strum Muse records in verse.</p>
         <p>Thus I proceed,--my humble strain }</p>
         <p>Has hap'ly pleas'd.----I may be vain,-- }</p>
         <p>But still it hopes to please again. }</p>
         <p>* * * * *</p>
         <p>In this great overwhelming town,</p>
         <p>Certain receptacles are known,</p>
         <p>Where both the sexes shew their faces</p>
         <p>To boast their talents and get places:</p>
         <p>Not such as kings and courts can give,</p>
         <p>Not such as noble folk receive,</p>
         <p>But those which yield their useful aid</p>
         <p>To common wants or gen'ral trade,</p>
         <p>Or finely furbish out the show</p>
         <p>That fashion does on life bestow.</p>
         <p>Here those who want them may apply</p>
         <p>For toiling powers and industry,</p>
         <p>On whom the nervous strength's bestow'd</p>
         <p>To urge the wheel or bear the load.</p>
         <p>Here all who want, may pick and chuse</p>
         <p>Each service of domestic use:</p>
         <p>The laundry, kitchen, chamber, dairy,</p>
         <p>May always find an Ann or Mary,</p>
         <p>While in th' accommodating room,</p>
         <p>He who wants coachman, footman, groom,</p>
         <p>Or butler staid, may come and have,</p>
         <p>With such as know to dress and shave.</p>
         <p>--The art and skill may here be sought</p>
         <p>In ev'ry thing that's sold and bought,</p>
         <p>In all the well spread counter tells</p>
         <p>Of knowledge keen in yards and ells;</p>
         <p>Adepts in selling and in buying</p>
         <p>And perfect in the modes of lying;</p>
         <p>Who flatter misses in their teens,</p>
         <p>And harangue over bombazeens,</p>
         <p>Can, in glib words, nor fear detection,</p>
         <p>Arrange each colour to complexion:</p>
         <p>Can teach the beau the neckcloth's tie,</p>
         <p>With most becoming gravity;</p>
         <p>Or with a consequential air,</p>
         <p>Turn up the collar to a hair.</p>
         <p>--Besides, your nice shop-women too,</p>
         <p>May at a call be brought to view,</p>
         <p>Who, with swift fingers, so bewitching,</p>
         <p>Are skill'd in ev'ry kind of stitching;</p>
         <p>Can trim the hat, arrange the bonnet,</p>
         <p>And place the tasty ribbon on it.</p>
         <p>In short, here all to service bound,</p>
         <p>May in their various shapes be found.</p>
         <p>--From such who may display their charms,</p>
         <p>By smirking looks and active arms,</p>
         <p>To those in kitchen under ground</p>
         <p>Amid black pots and kettles found:</p>
         <p>From such as teach the early rules,</p>
         <p>Or in the male or female schools,</p>
         <p>To those of an inferior breed,</p>
         <p>Who ne'er have known to write or read:</p>
         <p>From those who do the laws perplex</p>
         <p>In toil at an attorney's desk,</p>
         <p>To such as pass their busy lives</p>
         <p>In cleaning shoes or cleaning knives.</p>
         <p>To these, perhaps, an added score }</p>
         <p>Might swell the tiresome list or more, }</p>
         <p>But here description says, "give o'er." }</p>
         <p>In such enregistering shop</p>
         <p>One morn a figure chanc'd to pop;</p>
         <p>(But here I beg it may be guess'd,</p>
         <p>Of these same shops it was the best,</p>
         <p>His hat was rather worse for wear, }</p>
         <p>His clothing, too, was somewhat bare, }</p>
         <p>His boots might say, "we've travell'd far." }</p>
         <p>His left hand an umbrella bore</p>
         <p>And something like a glove he wore:</p>
         <p>Clean was his very sun-burnt skin</p>
         <p>Without a long hair on his chin,</p>
         <p>While his lank face, in ev'ry feature,</p>
         <p>Proclaim'd a keen, discerning nature;</p>
         <p>And when he spoke there was an air }</p>
         <p>Of something not quite common there: }</p>
         <p>His manner good, his language fair. }</p>
         <p>A double cape of curious make,</p>
         <p>Fell from his shoulders down his back,</p>
         <p>As if art did the folds provide</p>
         <p>A very awkward hump to hide;</p>
         <p>But, if 'twere so, the cunning fail'd,</p>
         <p>For still the treach'rous bunch prevail'd.</p>
         <p>By chatting here and talking there,</p>
         <p>He did his curious mind prepare</p>
         <p>With all the means by which to gain</p>
         <p>The end his wishes would obtain;--</p>
         <p>Then with half-humble, solemn face,</p>
         <p>He sought the ruler of the place,</p>
         <p>Who boasted an establish'd fame,</p>
         <p>And _Sharpsight_ was his well-known name.</p>
         <p>But ere we in our way proceed</p>
         <p>To tell of many a future deed,</p>
         <p>It may, we doubt not, be as well,</p>
         <p>To save all guess-work, just to tell,</p>
         <p>Of the part now upon the stage</p>
         <p>QUÆ GENUS was the personage.</p>
         <p>Fortune's dark clouds, for some time past</p>
         <p>That learned title had o'ercast,</p>
         <p>And he had borrow'd names in plenty,</p>
         <p>He might have gone by more than twenty;</p>
         <p>But now arriv'd in this great town }</p>
         <p>Without a fear of being known }</p>
         <p>He thought he might assume his own: }</p>
         <p>And he had weighty reasons too</p>
         <p>For what he was about to do,</p>
         <p>Which, we believe, a future page</p>
         <p>Will reconcile as reasons sage.</p>
         <p>At length his statement he began,</p>
         <p>When thus the conversation ran.</p>

         <p>To ask your counsel for my guide:</p>
         <p>But strange events have brought me here,</p>

         <p>I tell you Sir,--_you shall be PAID_."</p>
         <p>Sticking his pen behind his ear</p>
         <p>And with a keen enquiring leer,</p>
         <p>_Sharpsight_ the curious figure view'd,</p>

         <p>Of whate'er kind that place may be,</p>
         <p>Whether of high or low degree;</p>
         <p>Without them no access to station,</p>
         <p>No character, no situation.</p>
         <p>--What you assert, you say is true,</p>
         <p>I'm sure, my friend, I wish so too:</p>
         <p>For what you ask, as you describe,</p>
         <p>Is ask'd by all the serving tribe:</p>
         <p>'Tis that to which they all pretend,</p>
         <p>But those I never can commend</p>
         <p>In honour to my own good name, }</p>
         <p>And to this room's establish'd fame, }</p>
         <p>But what the rigid truth may claim. }</p>
         <p>Though as you look this place around,</p>
         <p>But common folk are to be found:</p>
         <p>Coachmen who sit without a whip;</p>
         <p>Footmen, without a call to skip;</p>
         <p>Gardeners who have lost their spade,</p>
         <p>And Journeymen without a trade;</p>
         <p>Clerks whose pens have long been idle;</p>
         <p>With grooms quite dull, who ask a bridle;</p>
         <p>Cooks who exclaim for roast and boil'd,</p>
         <p>And nurs'ry-maids without a child;</p>
         <p>Young, sprightly girls who long to clamber</p>
         <p>From drawing-rooms to upper chamber,</p>
         <p>Ready the drudg'ry to assail</p>
         <p>Of scrubbing-brush, and mop and pail;</p>
         <p>Stout porters who for places tarry,</p>
         <p>Whose shoulders ache for loads to carry;</p>
         <p>But character they must maintain,</p>
         <p>Or here they come, and pay in vain.</p>
         <p>In short, were I to count them o'er,</p>
         <p>I could name twenty kinds or more,</p>
         <p>Who patient and impatient wait</p>
         <p>About this busy, crowded gate.</p>
         <p>--But you might higher claimants see</p>
         <p>Within this crowded registry,</p>
         <p>Who do not at the desk appear,</p>
         <p>Nor e'er are seen in person here;</p>
         <p>But they are charged a larger fee,</p>
         <p>Both for success and secrecy.</p>
         <p>Thus you must see how much depends,</p>
         <p>To gain your object and your ends,</p>
         <p>That you should truly let me know</p>
         <p>What you have done,--what you can do;</p>
         <p>And I, once more, beg to refer</p>
         <p>To your good name and character."</p>
         <p>QUÆ GENUS.</p>
         <p>"I do profess I can engage</p>
         <p>With noble, simple, and with sage.</p>
         <p>Though young as yet, I've been so hurl'd</p>
         <p>About what you would call the world,</p>
         <p>That well I know it, yet 'tis true,</p>
         <p>I can be very honest too.</p>
         <p>--Of the good name which you demand,</p>
         <p>I tell you--I've not one at hand.</p>
         <p>Of friends, I once had ample store,</p>
         <p>But those fair, prosp'rous days are o'er,</p>
         <p>And I must mourn it to my cost</p>
         <p>That friends are dead, and gone, and lost;</p>
         <p>But if to conscience 'tis referr'd,</p>
         <p>My conscience says, Sir, take his word.</p>
         <p>--Of character, though I have none,</p>
         <p>Perhaps, Sir, I can purchase one:</p>
         <p>I, from a corner of my coat,</p>
         <p>May just pluck out a pretty note;</p>
         <p>Which, with a view to gain an end,</p>
         <p>Might, in an urgent want, befriend.</p>
         <p>Now, if to place me, you contrive, }</p>
         <p>Where I may have a chance to thrive; }</p>
         <p>I'll give this note, if I'm alive. }</p>
         <p>It may be rather worth your while;</p>
         <p>Perhaps it may awake a smile."</p>
         <p>_Sharpsight_ appear'd to look astray,</p>
         <p>But still he took a glance that way.</p>
         <p>"I'm not," he said, "to be beguil'd;"</p>
         <p>Though when he glanc'd that way, he _smil'd_,</p>
         <p>And, turning to the other side,</p>
         <p>In a calm, soften'd tone replied.</p>
         <p>SHARPSIGHT.</p>
         <p>"Here money is not that way earn'd,</p>
         <p>My reputation is concern'd;</p>
         <p>But still I can my duty do,</p>
         <p>And strive to be a friend to you.</p>
         <p>_Sir Jeff'ry Gourmand_ you may suit;</p>
         <p>A Knight renown'd, of high repute,</p>
         <p>As all who know his name can tell,</p>
         <p>For being rich and living well;</p>
         <p>A gen'rous man, but full of whim,</p>
         <p>And you may be the thing for him:</p>
         <p>In such a way your case I'll mention</p>
         <p>As shall awaken his attention.</p>
         <p>And now, my worthy friend, I pray,</p>
         <p>Mind well what I'm about to say:</p>
         <p>Without a creature to refer</p>
         <p>Or for good name or character,</p>
         <p>And in a state which seems to be</p>
         <p>Involv'd in awkward mystery;</p>
         <p>And I shall add, with your excuse</p>
         <p>For the remark which I must use,</p>
         <p>That either accident or nature</p>
         <p>Has, on your back, plac'd such a feature,</p>
         <p>That were you e'en my dearest friend,</p>
         <p>I dare not such an one commend</p>
         <p>To any lady worth a groat,</p>
         <p>Unless to serve the dame for nought.</p>
         <p>--Just turn around, and you may see</p>
         <p>A Lady in deep scrutiny,</p>
         <p>With a nice quizzing-glass in hand,</p>
         <p>Glancing across a liv'ried band;</p>
         <p>And once a month she does appear</p>
         <p>On this domestic errand here.</p>
         <p>If of a maid she wants the use,</p>
         <p>Her woman comes to pick and chuse;</p>
         <p>But if a man,--she is so nice,</p>
         <p>She comes herself to make the choice.</p>
         <p>A widow rich, who gives high wages,</p>
         <p>If they should please, whom she engages:</p>
         <p>But he must be of such a size,</p>
         <p>And look so well in her keen eyes,</p>
         <p>That she scarce one in twenty sees</p>
         <p>Fit to wear her rich liveries.</p>
         <p>There's one who has a squinting eye--</p>
         <p>I know full well she'll pass him by;</p>
         <p>On one poor rogue she'll turn her back</p>
         <p>Because his frightful beard is black;</p>
         <p>Another will not eat her bread</p>
         <p>Because his frizzled crop is red;</p>
         <p>These are too weak,--and those too strong,</p>
         <p>And some an inch too short or long:</p>
         <p>She'll take the best-made of the bunch,</p>
         <p>But would be fainting at a hunch.</p>
         <p>--Thus then, according to my plan,</p>
         <p>_Sir Jeff'ry Gourmand_ is the man;</p>
         <p>But to his questions pray reply</p>
         <p>Without the veil of mystery:</p>
         <p>Your story from your very youth,</p>
         <p>If he should ask it--tell the truth;</p>
         <p>Your errors fail not to unfold--</p>
         <p>In telling them be firm, be bold;</p>
         <p>While you your better virtues own,</p>
         <p>E'en let your mischiefs all be known,</p>
         <p>But let not folly blazen forth</p>
         <p>Whate'er you have of conscious worth;</p>
         <p>Express the ill with down-cast eye,</p>
         <p>And veil the good with modesty;</p>
         <p>Though, if you can with prudence poke</p>
         <p>Into your tale a funny joke,</p>
         <p>Fear not, 'tis what his humour loves,</p>
         <p>As his own daily chit-chat proves;</p>
         <p>And while he does his bev'rage quaff,</p>
         <p>At what he says--be sure you laugh.</p>
         <p>But should you not his service suit,</p>
         <p>He will not play the churlish brute;</p>
         <p>And if not gone too far astray,</p>
         <p>May serve you in some other way.</p>
         <p>Thus you must see I do my best--</p>
         <p>To Fortune I shall leave the rest:</p>
         <p>But now I see _Sir Jeff'ry_ enter,</p>
         <p>And I must leave you to your venture."</p>
         <p>_Sharpsight_ then after humbly greeting</p>
         <p>This huge man-mountain of good eating,</p>
         <p>For a few minutes in his ear,</p>
         <p>Told that which he alone could hear.</p>
         <p>The Knight then cast a curious eye</p>
         <p>On Johnny, who was standing by,</p>
         <p>And just enquir'd from whence he came,</p>
         <p>What was his age, and what his name;</p>
         <p>Whom he had serv'd, and why he left</p>
         <p>The place of which he was bereft?</p>

         <p>QUÆ GENUS.</p>
         <p>"If, Sir, it were not thought too free,</p>
         <p>If I might take the liberty,</p>
         <p>I would not wish you here to wait</p>
         <p>While I my strange condition state,</p>
         <p>As it would take an hour or more,</p>
         <p>My various story to explore;</p>
         <p>Tho' 'tis not such, that I should</p>
         <p>fear The tale to tell or you to hear:</p>
         <p>You, who will kind allowance make</p>
         <p>For wants that press, and hearts that ache,</p>
         <p>And passions that restraint disdain</p>
         <p>When justice sues, and sues in vain;</p>
         <p>And 'tis to that tale I refer</p>
         <p>For name, for age and character,</p>
         <p>Whom I have serv'd, and what the scene</p>
         <p>Where my frail manhood's years have been:</p>

         <p>To my young hist'ry to attend,</p>

         <p>And let my rude, misgotten shape</p>
         <p>From your observance to escape,</p>

         <p>To your good grace and confidence."</p>
         <p>"Then be it so," the Knight replied,</p>
         <p>"I trust I may be satisfied.</p>
         <p>I'm told there's something droll about you,</p>
         <p>But droll'ry will not make me scout you;</p>
         <p>Nor do I mind, my friend, the pack,</p>
         <p>Which you now wear upon your back:</p>
         <p>We're rather equal on that score--</p>

         <p>That his gay visage might be seen;</p>
         <p>Which seem'd to burst as from the hit</p>
         <p>Of the fat Knight's spontaneous wit,</p>
         <p>Who chuckled first, and then made known</p>
         <p>His further will to laughing John.</p>

         <p>The pages of the daily news:</p>
         <p>When, with a look and with a loll,</p>

         <p>He thus commenc'd the colloquy.--</p>
         <p>SIR JEFFERY.</p>
         <p>"First, I must ask to know your name,</p>

         <p>That I had parents must be true;</p>
         <p>A father and a mother too,</p>

         <p>It was not worth a miracle."</p>
         <p>SIR JEFFERY.</p>
         <p>"By whom, then, was QUÆ GENUS given?"</p>
         <p>QUÆ GENUS.</p>
         <p>"By one who is a saint in Heaven;</p>

         <p>They show that I respect them well.</p>

         <p>QUÆ GENUS.</p>
         <p>"I know it well, as you will see,</p>
         <p>It tells my infant history:</p>

         <p>That little infant whom you see }</p>
         <p>In basket laid,--that, Sir, is me, }</p>
         <p>Now grown to sad maturity. }</p>
         <p>--It was within an Inn of Court,</p>
         <p>Where busy Lawyers plead and sport;</p>
         <p>Upon those stairs and thus enclos'd,</p>
         <p>My new-born figure was expos'd.</p>
         <p>Of mercy they had little share }</p>
         <p>Whose cruel purpose plac'd me there, }</p>
         <p>And left me to the Lawyer's care; }</p>
         <p>For, had th' Attorney been in town,</p>
         <p>Who did those very chambers own,</p>
         <p>I doubt what might have been my fate:</p>
         <p>The thing was strange--the hour was late;</p>
         <p>The work-house might be distant far,</p>
         <p>And dubious been the nursings there.</p>
         <p>But one, perchance, possess'd the floor</p>
         <p>When I was laid beside the door,</p>
         <p>Who would have felt a crying sin</p>
         <p>Had he not ta'en the stranger in.</p>
         <p>When I this pictur'd figure view,</p>
         <p>So innocent--so helpless too,</p>
         <p>A smile's contending with a tear,</p>
         <p>On seeing what I now appear:</p>
         <p>A pretty figure for a casket,--</p>
         <p>A little Falstaff in the basket."</p>
         <p>SIR JEFFERY.</p>
         <p>"Further of this you need not tell,</p>
         <p>I know the curious story well;</p>
         <p>At least as far as there appears</p>
         <p>In what regards your infant years,</p>
         <p>And all that did your fate betide,</p>
         <p>Till your good friend the Doctor died.</p>
         <p>--But now,--Of _Masters_ name the last</p>

         <p>But O, she is a very devil,</p>
         <p>Which I am sure you will allow</p>
         <p>Soon as you come her name to know,</p>
         <p>Tho' oft and oft, and o'er and o'er,</p>
         <p>You must have heard it spoke before,</p>
         <p>But not in any pressing hour</p>
         <p>Have you been subject to her power.</p>
         <p>It might not be a thing of course</p>
         <p>But I her servant was perforce,</p>
         <p>For sure as my name is QUÆ GENUS</p>
         <p>There seem'd a contract made between us;</p>
         <p>And her sad service I must rue,</p>
         <p>If I come not to live with you;</p>
         <p>With her I must continue still,</p>
         <p>If it proves not your gen'rous will,</p>
         <p>To receive me, Sir, from her</p>
         <p>With what she gives of character,</p>
         <p>For she sometimes can make pretence</p>
         <p>To ask heart-felt benevolence."</p>
         <p>SIR JEFFERY.</p>
         <p>"This is most strange, I do declare! }</p>
         <p>But pray what figure did she bear }</p>
         <p>While you th' unwilling servant were?" }</p>
         <p>QUÆ GENUS.</p>
         <p>"An ever-varying form she wore,</p>
         <p>As ever changeful Proteus bore:</p>
         <p>But or in motion she, or still;</p>
         <p>Her ev'ry hour is mark'd with ill.</p>
         <p>She looks best pleas'd when sorrow flows,</p>
         <p>She can disdain when virtue bows:</p>
         <p>Labour and penury and pain</p>
         <p>And sad disease compose her train,</p>
         <p>While vain complaint and discontent</p>
         <p>Form her pale-fac'd establishment."</p>
         <p>SIR JEFF'RY now let loose a smile</p>
         <p>As if some fancy did beguile</p>
         <p>And play upon his easy thought,</p>
         <p>With light, amusive mischief fraught;</p>
         <p>And this sarcastic question prov'd</p>
         <p>The pleasantry _Sir Jeff'ry_ lov'd.</p>
         <p>"When she was in a spiteful humour,</p>
         <p>What said she of that _pretty tumour_?</p>
         <p>The which without a wish to pry,</p>
         <p>Must sometimes meet her wand'ring eye.</p>
         <p>Did she ne'er stroke your circling back,</p>
         <p>Nor e'er salute it with a smack;</p>
         <p>Or when she was dispos'd to sneer</p>
         <p>Compare it to a Hemisphere,</p>
         <p>Deck it with sun and moon and stars,</p>
         <p>With Venus, Mercury and Mars,</p>
         <p>Or cover with her liv'ry's robe</p>
         <p>The Continents of half the Globe;</p>
         <p>Or like an Atlas, did she flout you</p>
         <p>As you bore half the world about you,</p>
         <p>When you might show it as a sight,</p>
         <p>And gain no common profit by't;</p>
         <p>Blend with the Panorama's skill,</p>
         <p>In all the pride of printed bill,</p>
         <p>Deliver'd with a ready hand</p>
         <p>Through Leic'ster-fields or in the Strand."</p>
         <p>The Knight's loud laughter then succeeded,--</p>
         <p>And Johnny laughing too, proceeded.</p>
         <p>"How happy you who thus can joke</p>
         <p>And wrap me in your funny cloak,</p>
         <p>Nay, when your mirth, Sir, may think fit,</p>
         <p>Can fill my crooked back with wit;</p>
         <p>Can even make me almost proud,</p>
         <p>Of that self-same prepost'rous load.</p>
         <p>You may, perhaps, be not aware,</p>
         <p>But 'tis the truth which I declare,</p>
         <p>I would serve you for half the wages</p>
         <p>Which common servitude engages,</p>
         <p>Provided you would pay the rest</p>
         <p>In such nice puns and merry jest;</p>
         <p>I would with joy sign the receipt,</p>
         <p>For half in cash, and half in wit."</p>
         <p>"Well, well, go on," _Sir Jeff'ry_ said,</p>
         <p>While his glad, twinkling eyes betray'd,</p>
         <p>How much QUÆ GENUS pleas'd his fancy</p>
         <p>At this so flatt'ring necromancy.</p>
         <p>--While the Knight his cold coffee quaffing,</p>
         <p>But still at his own fancies laughing,</p>
         <p>Exclaim'd, "proceed, but be it known, }</p>
         <p>I wish the lady's hist'ry done, }</p>
         <p>And then you will conclude your own." }</p>
         <p>QUÆ GENUS.</p>
         <p>"When she first knew me she could see</p>
         <p>A form as strait as poplar tree,</p>
         <p>Then I was ruddy, fair and plump,</p>
         <p>Nor was my back crown'd with a hump,</p>
         <p>Of which you may not be aware,</p>
         <p>For hang the hag, she plac'd it there,</p>
         <p>And you, good Sir, shall shortly know,</p>
         <p>How to her power the gift I owe."</p>
         <p>SIR JEFFERY.</p>
         <p>"The more I hear, the more I see,</p>
         <p>The more you deal in mystery.</p>
         <p>This Mistress, sure, of which you tell,</p>
         <p>Is an INCOMPREHENSIBLE!</p>
         <p>A widow she, or is she wedded?</p>
         <p>Or e'er by blushing Hymen bedded?"</p>
         <p>QUÆ GENUS.</p>
         <p>"O no, Sir, no.--She is more common</p>
         <p>Than is the worst street-walking woman.</p>
         <p>There's scarce a mortal about town</p>
         <p>To whom this Mistress is not known;</p>
         <p>And if the track I should pursue,</p>
         <p>I might add in the country too.</p>
         <p>But 'tis a keen wit that unravels</p>
         <p>The wide extent of all her travels;</p>
         <p>Nor time nor space has she to spare,</p>
         <p>She's here and there and ev'ry where.</p>
         <p>Though if I at a guess may venture</p>
         <p>Beneath this roof she will not enter,</p>
         <p>Unless, as you the chance may see,</p>
         <p>The saucy minx comes here with me."</p>
         <p>SIR JEFFERY.</p>
         <p>"But one more question I've to ask,</p>
         <p>Ere you perform your promis'd task,</p>
         <p>And tell me from all shuffling free,</p>
         <p>The items of your history,</p>
         <p>Up to the moment when you stand</p>
         <p>A candidate for my command.</p>
         <p>And now QUÆ GENUS tell the name</p>
         <p>Of this same universal dame,</p>
         <p>Whom you, poor fellow, have been serving,</p>
         <p>And, as you state it, almost starving.</p>
         <p>--If in your tale she does agree,</p>
         <p>It is a tale of mystery;</p>
         <p>Some fairy fable, I suppose,</p>
         <p>That paints, in emblems, human woes,</p>
         <p>And does in figur'd words, apply</p>
         <p>To your peculiar history.</p>
         <p>It is not in the usual way</p>
         <p>That such as you their state display;</p>
         <p>It is not in such borrow'd guise</p>
         <p>That they unfold their histories,</p>
         <p>With here and there a little bit</p>
         <p>Of droll'ry to shew off their wit;</p>
         <p>It is not in this form I see</p>
         <p>Those who may wear my livery;</p>
         <p>But your's I feel a diff'rent case</p>
         <p>From those who come to seek a place;</p>
         <p>Or when the register may send him,</p>
         <p>With, 'Sir, we beg to recommend him.'</p>
         <p>I now bethink me of the sage</p>
         <p>Who lov'd you in your tender age;</p>
         <p>And when I see you have a claim }</p>
         <p>To share the page that marks his fame, }</p>
         <p>SYNTAX, that highly honour'd name }</p>
         <p>A passport is, my good QUÆ GENUS,</p>
         <p>To the familiar talk between us.</p>
         <p>From that relation which you share,</p>
         <p>No longer stand, but take a chair,</p>
         <p>And now proceed, without delay,</p>
         <p>To close the tale in your own way.</p>
         <p>"And once again, I ask the name</p>
         <p>Of this so universal dame;</p>
         <p>What is her fortune,--where she lives,</p>
         <p>And the strange means by which she thrives?</p>
         <p>Where she acquires her wond'rous power,</p>
         <p>Which you describe, o'er ev'ry hour?</p>
         <p>Where it began, my curious friend;</p>
         <p>Then tell me, pray, when it will end."</p>
         <p>With due respect, as was requir'd,</p>
         <p>He took the chair for he was tir'd,</p>
         <p>And calling truth to be his guide,</p>
         <p>He thus in solemn tone replied.</p>
         <p>QUÆ GENUS.</p>
         <p>"MISS-FORTUNE is the name she bears,</p>
         <p>Her rent-roll's form'd of sighs and tears:</p>
         <p>She doth not live or here or there,</p>
         <p>I fear, Sir, she lives ev'ry where.</p>
         <p>I'm sure that I know not the ground</p>
         <p>Where her sad influence is not found;</p>
         <p>But if a circle should appear }</p>
         <p>Beyond her arbitrary sphere, }</p>
         <p>I feel and hope, Sir, it is here. }</p>
         <p>--This worn-out coat, Sir, which you see,</p>
         <p>Is the kind Lady's livery:</p>
         <p>I once was fat, but now am thin,</p>
         <p>Made up of nought but bone and skin;</p>
         <p>I once was large but now am small,</p>
         <p>From feeding in her servants'-hall,</p>
         <p>And the hump I shall ever bear</p>
         <p>Is an example of her care.</p>
         <p>As for the blessed Dame's beginning,</p>
         <p>I've heard that it began in sinning,</p>
         <p>And I have learn'd that she will end</p>
         <p>When this vile world has learn'd to mend;</p>
         <p>But if we guess when that may be,</p>
         <p>We may guess to eternity."</p>
         <p>"MISS-FORTUNE!! Heav'ns! O thus she's nam'd,"</p>
         <p>The Knight, with uplift eyes exclaim'd.</p>
         <p>"O the dull head, not to have seen</p>
         <p>What the _Finale_ must have been!"</p>
         <p>Then clasping hands and chuckling first</p>
         <p>Into a bellowing laugh he burst,</p>
         <p>Though not to his broad face confin'd,</p>
         <p>But on each side, before, behind,</p>
         <p>It seem'd as if his whimsies bound him,</p>
         <p>In a joyous circle round him:</p>
         <p>His belly trembles, his sides ache,</p>
         <p>And the great-chair scarce stands the shake.</p>
         <p>'Twas a hoarse, deep bass, note of mirth,</p>
         <p>To which his fancy thus gave birth;</p>
         <p>And Johnny fail'd not to come after</p>
         <p>An octave higher in his laughter,</p>
         <p>While his delight appear'd to speak</p>
         <p>In somewhat of a treble squeak.--</p>
         <p>Thus, for some minutes they enjoy'd</p>
         <p>The _Duo_ which their nerves employ'd.</p>
         <p>_Sir Jeff'ry_ shook his head awhile,</p>
         <p>Then spoke with a complacent smile.</p>
         <p>"Though in a diff'ring point of view, }</p>
         <p>I know her just as well as you; }</p>
         <p>And hang the hag she plagues me too. }</p>
         <p>Need I, good fellow, need I tell ye,</p>
         <p>She deck'd me out with this great belly;</p>
         <p>'Tis she, by way of friendly treat,</p>
         <p>Has given this pair of gouty feet;</p>
         <p>Nay sometimes when her whim commands</p>
         <p>_Miss-Fortune_ robs me of my hands:</p>
         <p>'Tis she with her intention vile</p>
         <p>That makes me overflow with bile;</p>
         <p>And tho' my table's spread with plenty</p>
         <p>Of ev'ry nice and costly dainty,</p>
         <p>She sometimes envies me a bite,</p>
         <p>And takes away my appetite.</p>
         <p>She does not meddle with my wealth,</p>
         <p>But then she undermines my health;</p>
         <p>She never in my strong box looks,</p>
         <p>Nor pries into my banker's books;</p>
         <p>My ample fortune I contrive</p>
         <p>To guard with care and make it thrive,</p>
         <p>I check her power to destroy it,</p>
         <p>But then she says, 'you sha'n't enjoy it;</p>
         <p>I will take care you shall endure</p>
         <p>The ills and pains gold cannot cure.'</p>
         <p>Or leagu'd with wrinkled age at least,</p>
         <p>She strives to interrupt the feast.</p>
         <p>--But with her malice I contend,</p>
         <p>Where she's a foe, I'm oft a friend,</p>
         <p>And, with the weapons I can wield,</p>
         <p>I sometimes drive her from the field.</p>
         <p>Nay when she does the victim clasp,</p>
         <p>I snatch it from her cruel grasp.</p>
         <p>And thus you see, or more or less,</p>
         <p>I make her prove my happiness."</p>
         <p>QUÆ GENUS.</p>
         <p>"There was indeed a time when I</p>
         <p>Knew her but by warm sympathy</p>
         <p>With those who did her burthen bear,</p>
         <p>Which I have since been forc'd to share;</p>
         <p>But this, at least, I'm pleas'd to own,</p>
         <p>And 'tis a truth to you well known,</p>
         <p>Nay, this I'll say, in others' breast,</p>
         <p>Where'er the virtue is possess'd,</p>
         <p>She does, as I have felt, and see,</p>
         <p>Awake benign Humanity."</p>
         <p>SIR JEFFERY.</p>
         <p>"And she shall 'wake it now, QUÆ GENUS!</p>
         <p>An instant contract's made between us.</p>
         <p>I break that which she made with you,</p>
         <p>And gladly you abjure it too.</p>
         <p>I have no doubt, my friend, to venture;</p>
         <p>Into my service you shall enter,</p>
         <p>Your ills at present shall be o'er,</p>
         <p>_Miss-Fortune_ you shall serve no more.</p>
         <p>At least, I say, while you contrive</p>
         <p>By your good deeds with me to live:</p>
         <p>I'll save you from your late disaster</p>
         <p>And change your mistress for a master.</p>
         <p>I want no bowings, no grimaces,</p>
         <p>No blessings that I've chang'd your places.</p>
         <p>--I now remind you to relate</p>
         <p>All that has been your various fate,</p>
         <p>Nay, all that you have ever known,</p>
         <p>Since time and freedom were your own.</p>
         <p>--I tell you, _Johnny_, speak the truth;</p>
         <p>I know what follies wait on youth:</p>
         <p>I know where erring passion leads,</p>
         <p>On what a slipp'ry ground it treads:</p>
         <p>I can remember that I fail'd</p>
         <p>When the gay, tempting world prevail'd;</p>
         <p>Nor shall I now the thought conceal,</p>
         <p>Which reason tells me to reveal.</p>
         <p>What Heaven forgives should be forgiven</p>
         <p>By all who look with hope tow'rds Heaven:</p>
         <p>But I expect not faults alone, }</p>
         <p>I trust in what you may have done, }</p>
         <p>There may work out a little fun. }</p>
         <p>--If I guess right your lively eye }</p>
         <p>Was not exactly made to cry, }</p>
         <p>But sometimes call forth pleasantry; }</p>
         <p>Of diff'ring thoughts to ope the vein,</p>
         <p>Let pleasure forth or lessen pain.</p>
         <p>But still do not your mischiefs hide,</p>
         <p>Throughout your tale, be truth your guide;</p>
         <p>Nor make _Miss-Fortune_ though she starves,</p>
         <p>Worse, by the bye, than she deserves,</p>
         <p>For after all her misdeeds past,</p>
         <p>The Dame may do you good at last.</p>
         <p>--Deceive me, and you will offend,</p>
         <p>Deceive me, and you lose a friend:</p>
         <p>Try to deceive me and again</p>
         <p>You'll join _Miss-Fortune's_ pale-fac'd train.</p>
         <p>Proceed then, and, without a fear, }</p>
         <p>Pour thy misdoings in my ear }</p>
         <p>And I will with indulgence hear. }</p>
         <p>I'll not discard you for the evil,</p>
         <p>Though you should prove a little devil,</p>
         <p>Though to your hump you should not fail,</p>
         <p>To add your horns and hoofs and tail;</p>
         <p>Though you should prove a bag of sin,</p>
         <p>And hump'd without be hump'd within,</p>
         <p>Here you shall have your home, your food;</p>
         <p>Kick at _Miss-Fortune_, and be good."</p>
         <p>He spoke, then rang the shrill-ton'd bell,</p>
         <p>Which did its well-known message tell.--</p>
         <p>A tray appear'd, and well prepar'd,</p>
         <p>Which _Johnny_ with _Sir Jeff'ry_ shar'd.</p>
         <p>When, waving his beflannell'd hand,</p>
         <p>The knight thus utter'd his command.</p>
         <p>"And now, thou little Imp of Sin,</p>
         <p>Without a compliment begin."</p>
         <p>QUÆ GENUS.</p>
         <p>"The Volume that now lies before ye,</p>
         <p>Tells you thus far, Sir, of my story;</p>
         <p>Which would be upon this occasion</p>
         <p>A work of supererogation;</p>
         <p>Though I shall beg leave to repeat,</p>
         <p>I'm not the new-born of the street;</p>
         <p>But as it never yet appear'd,</p>
         <p>At least, as I have ever heard,</p>
         <p>To such unknown, unfather'd heirs,</p>
         <p>I am a Foundling of _the stairs_,</p>
         <p>Without a mark upon the dress,</p>
         <p>By which there might be form'd a guess,</p>
         <p>Whether I should the offspring prove</p>
         <p>Of noble or of vulgar love;</p>
         <p>Whether thus left in Inn of Court</p>
         <p>Where Lawyers live of ev'ry sort;</p>
         <p>Love in a deep full-bottom clad,</p>
         <p>Gave me a grave black-letter'd dad,</p>
         <p>Who, if 'twere so, might not agree</p>
         <p>To have a child without a fee;</p>
         <p>And, therefore, would not plead my cause,</p>
         <p>But left me to the vagrant laws</p>
         <p>Of chance, who did not do amiss,</p>
         <p>But sued in _Formâ Pauperis_,</p>
         <p>And, in a Court where Mercy reign'd,</p>
         <p>The little Foundling's cause was gain'd:</p>
         <p>SYNTAX was judge, and pity's power</p>
         <p>Sav'd me in that forsaken hour.</p>
         <p>He with that truly Christian spirit,</p>
         <p>Which Heaven gave him to inherit,</p>
         <p>Fondly embrac'd me as his own;</p>
         <p>But ere three transient years were gone,</p>
         <p>I lost my friend, but found another,</p>
         <p>A father he, and she, a mother;</p>
         <p>For such at least they both have prov'd,</p>
         <p>And as their child the stranger lov'd.</p>
         <p>O, rest her soul!--to her 'tis given</p>
         <p>To share his happy lot in Heaven.</p>
         <p>I seem'd to be her utmost pride,</p>
         <p>And Johnny trotting by her side,</p>
         <p>Fill'd with delight her glancing eye</p>
         <p>In warm affection's sympathy.</p>
         <p>This fond, this kind, this fost'ring friend</p>
         <p>Did to my ev'ry want attend;</p>
         <p>Her only fault, she rather spoil'd</p>
         <p>As he grew up, the darling child;</p>
         <p>But though her care was not confin'd</p>
         <p>Or to his body, or his mind,</p>
         <p>Though, with a fond parental view,</p>
         <p>She gave to both th' attention due,</p>
         <p>Ne'er would she her displeasure fix</p>
         <p>On his most wild, unlucky tricks.</p>
         <p>So that at church he held grave airs,</p>
         <p>Pronounc'd Amen, and said his pray'rs,</p>
         <p>And on a Sunday evening read</p>
         <p>A sermon ere they went to bed,</p>
         <p>Throughout the week, he was quite free</p>
         <p>For mischief with impunity.</p>
         <p>--If on the folk I squirted water,</p>
         <p>How she would shake her sides with laughter;</p>
         <p>If the long-rotten eggs were thrown</p>
         <p>At Mary, Sally, or at Joan;</p>
         <p>If any stinging stuff was put</p>
         <p>Into the hasty trav'ller's boot;</p>
         <p>If the sly movement of the heel</p>
         <p>Should overturn the spinning-wheel.</p>
         <p>--If holly plac'd beside the rose</p>
         <p>Should wound the gay sheep-shearer's nose,</p>
         <p>Or 'neath the tail a thorn-bush pricking,</p>
         <p>Should set Dame Dobbins' mare a kicking,</p>
         <p>And overthrow the market load,</p>
         <p>While beans and peas o'erspread the road,</p>
         <p>If the poor injur'd made complaint</p>
         <p>To Madam of her wily saint,</p>
         <p>She would reply, 'pray cease your noise,</p>
         <p>These are the tricks of clever boys,</p>
         <p>It is my pleasant Johnny's fun,</p>
         <p>Tell me the damage, and have done.'</p>
         <p>--When I became a rosy boy,</p>
         <p>My growth encreas'd her growing joy;</p>
         <p>But now such gamesome hours were o'er</p>
         <p>I play'd my childish tricks no more.</p>
         <p>My little heart 'gan to beat high,</p>
         <p>And with heroic ardor try</p>
         <p>The tempting danger to pursue,</p>
         <p>And do what others could not do:</p>
         <p>I sought to climb the highest tree,</p>
         <p>Where none would dare to follow me,</p>
         <p>Or the gay sporting horse to ride,</p>
         <p>Which no school-fellow dare bestride.</p>
         <p>My feats were sometimes rather scaring,</p>
         <p>But the Dame lov'd to see me daring;</p>
         <p>As by my running, leaping, walking,</p>
         <p>I us'd to set the parish talking,</p>
         <p>And, to the good old women's wonder,</p>
         <p>I fear'd not lightning nor thunder.</p>
         <p>She thought, in future time, my name }</p>
         <p>By some achievement bold, might claim }</p>
         <p>A loud blast in the trump of fame. }</p>
         <p>"When, as a youth, how great the charm</p>
         <p>To lean upon his willing arm,</p>
         <p>Or when she wish'd to take the air,</p>
         <p>To guide her poney in the chair;</p>
         <p>To fetch her book, to place her stool,</p>
         <p>Or bear the _laden ridicule:_</p>
         <p>To chat, to laugh, to sing, to read,</p>
         <p>As whims or wishes might succeed:</p>
         <p>And I am proud to make it known</p>
         <p>Her ev'ry pleasure was my own;</p>
         <p>And all to please her I could do,</p>
         <p>Was joy, as it was duty too.</p>
         <p>"Here now my better story ends--</p>
         <p>So far, I trust, Sir, we are friends:</p>
         <p>But I could almost wish me dumb,</p>
         <p>When I must tell of what's to come."</p>
         <p>_Sir Jeffery_, half-laughing, said,</p>
         <p>"_Johnny_, I pray, be not afraid,</p>
         <p>Whate'er your luckless wit has done,</p>
         <p>I swear I will set down in fun;</p>
         <p>By me, your sins shall be forgiven</p>
         <p>As sure as Mercy is in Heaven."</p>
         <p>QUÆ GENUS.</p>
         <p>"Then, at your pleasure I proceed,</p>
         <p>Nor will I hide a single deed;</p>
         <p>There is but one I doubt to own,</p>
         <p>But that to you shall be made known,</p>
         <p>And will with you securely rest</p>
         <p>As in my own uneasy breast;</p>
         <p>Though I'm afraid of vengeful laws</p>
         <p>As I believe without a cause.</p>
         <p>Indeed, I have contriv'd to play</p>
         <p>The very fool for many a day,</p>
         <p>But brief, be sure, I'll strive to be</p>
         <p>In this my early history.</p>
         <p>"And here, an' please you, Sir, begins</p>
         <p id="ca2">The tale of my mishaps--the chapter of my sins."</p>
         <p>CANTO II</p>
         <p>It may seem queer when 'tis the will</p>
         <p>Of Fate, its wishes to fulfil,</p>
         <p>To call the culprit to the bar,</p>
         <p>One born beneath a luckless star,</p>
         <p>And from his urging conscience tell</p>
         <p>The truths that on his mem'ry dwell,</p>
         <p>When, like a checquer they display</p>
         <p>The black and white to open day.</p>
         <p>Thus, as the truth he's bound to state,</p>
         <p>The former may preponderate;</p>
         <p>While, in a happy moment bold,</p>
         <p>He may some conscious good unfold,</p>
         <p>Nor can the awkward task refuse</p>
         <p>Both to applaud and to accuse.</p>
         <p>--Such thoughts as these might be the cause,</p>
         <p>Why poor QUÆ GENUS made a pause.</p>
         <p>"Well," said _Sir Jeff'ry_, "pray go on,</p>
         <p>Or never will your tale have done:</p>
         <p>I've told you, and you must attend;</p>
         <p>You tell your story to a friend,</p>
         <p>Who will, whatever may appear,</p>
         <p>With kindness and compassion hear."</p>
         <p>QUÆ GENUS.</p>
         <p>"Your pardon, Sir, I will proceed,</p>
         <p>Nor stop till I've perform'd the deed.</p>
         <p>--Thus, so far Fortune deck'd with smiles</p>
         <p>The season which our youth beguiles,</p>
         <p>And gave the hope of added measure</p>
         <p>To gay delight and solid pleasure:</p>
         <p>But while the merry song went round,</p>
         <p>And to the tabor's lively sound,</p>
         <p>The village did in cadence beat,</p>
         <p>With all its many twinkling feet,</p>
         <p>Pale Fate appear'd, in cypress wreath,</p>
         <p>And call'd out for the DANCE OF DEATH:</p>
         <p>When my dear friend, who gave the feast,</p>
         <p>And cheer'd with smiles each happy guest,</p>
         <p>Was borne away, I scarce knew why,</p>
         <p>But I was told,--it was to die.</p>
         <p>And soon, alas! I wond'ring saw</p>
         <p>All govern'd by a man of law,</p>
         <p>With whom she seldom converse held,</p>
         <p>But when her private cares compell'd</p>
         <p>Some petty, trifling, legal aid,</p>
         <p>Which coolly she discharg'd and paid.</p>
         <p>'Twas by this man's exulting side</p>
         <p>I walk'd along and sobb'd and sigh'd</p>
         <p>When she was carried to the bourne</p>
         <p>From whence we mortals ne'er return.</p>
         <p>--I was by all around approv'd,</p>
         <p>And by the better neighbours lov'd,</p>
         <p>While I in ev'ry eye could see</p>
         <p>The pity that was felt for me.</p>
         <p>By her death-bed he held the quill</p>
         <p>That made him master of her will,</p>
         <p>While a round sum was written there</p>
         <p>To pay him for the tender care</p>
         <p>Which he of her sweet boy would take,</p>
         <p>For her's and her dear husband's sake.</p>
         <p>Husband! whom this same man of law,</p>
         <p>This forging rascal never saw:</p>
         <p>Indeed by many it was thought</p>
         <p>He put his name where he ought not.</p>
         <p>It much surpriz'd each curious friend,</p>
         <p>And quite astonish'd _Doctor Bend_,</p>
         <p>Whose rev'rend titles should have been</p>
         <p>Where the foul lawyer's name was seen.</p>
         <p>Wrong was suspected, Counsel had,</p>
         <p>But no objection could be made,</p>
         <p>And by all forms of law allied,</p>
         <p>The will was shap'd and testified:</p>
         <p>The attorney to his duties swore,</p>
         <p>So he became Executor.</p>
         <p>'Tis true she left her all to me,</p>
         <p>But here and there a legacy;</p>
         <p>Though, such were this strange will's commands</p>
         <p>Through _Lawyer Gripe-all's_ grasping hands,</p>
         <p>All was to pass and there remain</p>
         <p>Till I the age of man attain;</p>
         <p>And if I chanc'd to die before,--</p>
         <p>The lawyer was to take the store.</p>
         <p>All saw, or all believ'd the cheat,</p>
         <p>But the law veil'd the base deceit,</p>
         <p>And when the doctor came to see</p>
         <p>How justice might be done to me,</p>
         <p>On due reflection, thought it fit,</p>
         <p>As things were order'd, to submit;</p>
         <p>Told me, at present, to be quiet,</p>
         <p>To seem content, nor breed a riot,</p>
         <p>But when I truely crav'd a friend,</p>
         <p>I knew the home of _Dickey Bend_;</p>
         <p>Then with affection's warmth caress'd me,</p>
         <p>And, with a parent's blessing, bless'd me.</p>
         <p>"From that dear cottage now I mov'd,</p>
         <p>Where I such tender fondness prov'd;</p>
         <p>From a calm scene of taste refin'd,</p>
         <p>And all that could improve the mind;</p>
         <p>Where daily blessings were bestow'd</p>
         <p>From all the humble neighbourhood;</p>
         <p>Where heart-felt goodness was employ'd,</p>
         <p>And social harmony enjoy'd;--</p>
         <p>From these QUÆ GENUS was transferr'd</p>
         <p>To where the daily curse was heard,</p>
         <p>Where the law's promise was delay'd,</p>
         <p>And money for injustice paid;</p>
         <p>Or a loud, base, malignant joy,</p>
         <p>Which the law's triumphs might employ;--</p>
         <p>To an old house that stood alone,</p>
         <p>With ivy and with moss o'ergrown,</p>
         <p>And where the practiser of laws</p>
         <p>Did his foul deeds 'mid bats and daws;</p>
         <p>Nay, which, as fame reports, was worse,</p>
         <p>The house was saddled with a curse,</p>
         <p>That _Gripe-all_, in the law's despite,</p>
         <p>Had robb'd some widow of her right,</p>
         <p>And, by his cutting and his carving,</p>
         <p>Had got the house--and left her starving.</p>
         <p>"Oft I my loss, in secret, wept,</p>
         <p>And when my eyelids should have slept,</p>
         <p>Nay, when those eyelids should have clos'd</p>
         <p>And I in strength'ning sleep repos'd,</p>
         <p>They remain'd wakeful oft and shed</p>
         <p>Their dews upon my troubled bed.</p>
         <p>Though Master _Gripe-all_, it was known</p>
         <p>Shew'd me a kindness not his own;</p>
         <p>And did with all indulgence treat me,</p>
         <p>As the best means, at length, to cheat me.</p>
         <p>He strove my early grief to soothe,</p>
         <p>Call'd me his dear, delightful youth;</p>
         <p>Gave me a pretty horse to ride,</p>
         <p>With money in my purse beside;</p>
         <p>Let me employ the taylor's art</p>
         <p>To deck me out and make me smart,</p>
         <p>Let me just study when I pleas'd,</p>
         <p>Nor e'er my mind with learning teas'd.</p>
         <p>But still a gnawing discontent</p>
         <p>Prey'd on me wheresoe'er I went.</p>
         <p>--Of Phillis too I was bereft,</p>
         <p>One real pleasure that was left:</p>
         <p>A fav'rite spaniel of my friend,</p>
         <p>That did on all my steps attend,</p>
         <p>At eve was frisking, fond and gay, }</p>
         <p>But on the sad succeeding day, }</p>
         <p>A poison'd, swollen form it lay. }</p>
         <p>It might be chance, but while I griev'd,</p>
         <p>The following letter I received,</p>
         <p>Which was thrown o'er a hedge the while</p>
         <p>I sat half weeping on a stile.</p>
         <p>The writer I could never tell;</p>
         <p>But he who wrote it meant me well;</p>
         <p>And I've no doubt that it contain'd</p>
         <p>The thoughts which through the country reign'd."</p>
         <p>LETTER.</p>
         <p>"_I'm a poor man, but yet can spell, }</p>
         <p>And I lov'd Madam SYNTAX well: }</p>
         <p>--But I've a sorry tale to tell. }</p>
         <p>Young 'Squire you're in the Devil's hands,</p>

         <p>And I've heard some one say, whose name</p>
         <p>I must not give to common fame,</p>
         <p>He'd lay ten pounds and say, 'have done,'</p>
         <p>You liv'd not on to twenty-one;</p>
         <p>And if you die before, 'tis known,</p>

         <p>'Tis Beelzebub alone who knows!</p>
         <p>He in a lonely mansion lives,</p>
         <p>But there the cunning villain thrives:</p>
         <p>Yes, he gets on, as it appears,</p>
         <p>By setting people by the ears:</p>
         <p>Though I have heard NAN MIDWIFE say,</p>
         <p>Who sometimes travels late that way,</p>
         <p>That 'neath the yew, near the house wall,</p>
         <p>Where the dark ivy's seen to crawl,</p>
         <p>A cat she once saw which was half</p>
         <p>As big as any full-grown calf,</p>
         <p>And with her tail beat down the bushes,</p>
         <p>As if they were but slender rushes;</p>
         <p>Has often felt sulphureous steam,</p>
         <p>And seen bright lines of lightning gleam.</p>
         <p>These things the good, old woman, swears</p>
         <p>She sometimes smells and sees and hears,</p>
         <p>While thus all trembling with affright,</p>
         <p>She scarce can get her bald mare by't.</p>
         <p>--Run off, young 'Squire, for much I fear</p>
         <p>You'll be cut off, if you stay here.</p>
         <p>My service thus I do commend,</p>
         <p>From, Sir, your very humble friend:</p>
         <p>And hope you will take in good part,</p>
         <p>What comes from poor but honest heart!_"</p>
         <p>"This plain epistle told no more</p>

         <p>Yet still the honest counsel brought</p>
         <p>My mind to a new range of thought.</p>
         <p>"One day as I was riding out,</p>
         <p>Prowling the country round about,</p>
         <p>A guide-post stood, in letter'd pride,</p>
         <p>Close by the dusty high-road side:</p>
         <p>With many towns for passage fam'd,</p>
         <p>_Oxford_ upon its points was nam'd,</p>
         <p>Which instant call'd me to attend</p>
         <p>To my kind patron _Doctor Bend_:</p>
         <p>And then there 'rose within my breast</p>
         <p>A thought that reason did suggest,</p>
         <p>And not th' effect of boyish whim,</p>
         <p>'_Th' Attorney quit and fly to him_.'--</p>
         <p>--Soon after, by a lucky chance,</p>
         <p>I heard what made my heart to dance,</p>
         <p>That _Cerberus_ would be from home,</p>
         <p>At least for sev'ral days to come,</p>
         <p>Though, when of me he took his leave,</p>
         <p>He said, 'expect me home at eve,</p>
         <p>But, as talk may the way beguile,'</p>
         <p>He added, 'ride with me a mile.'</p>
         <p>--This was the very thing I wish'd,</p>
         <p>For now I felt the fox was dish'd.</p>
         <p>He rode on first and bade me follow,</p>
         <p>'Twas then that I began to hollow;</p>
         <p>I had but one _white lie_ to tell</p>
         <p>And all things would be going well.</p>
         <p>I said it was my guardian's whim</p>
         <p>That I should make the tour with him,</p>
         <p>And ask'd for a clean shirt or so</p>
         <p>As I had such a way to go.</p>
         <p>Thus my great-coat, most closely roll'd,</p>
         <p>Did all the useful package hold,</p>
         <p>And to the saddle strongly tied</p>
         <p>I was completely satisfied,</p>
         <p>As nought appear'd, thus pack'd together,</p>
         <p>But a protection from the weather,</p>
         <p>So that the lawyer's lynx's eye</p>
         <p>Was clos'd on curiosity:</p>
         <p>For Madam Gripe-all's ready care</p>
         <p>Did, to my wish, the whole prepare.</p>
         <p>Indeed, whatever she might be,</p>
         <p>Her kindness never fail'd to me.</p>
         <p>She frequently would call me son,</p>
         <p>And say she lov'd me as her own;</p>
         <p>Nay, when the clock struck, she would say,</p>
         <p>'Kiss me as often, dear, I pray</p>
         <p>As that same clock is heard to strike,</p>
         <p>And oft'ner, dearest, if you like.'</p>
         <p>Though such favour ne'er was shown, }</p>
         <p>But when we both were quite alone, }</p>
         <p>And seldom when the clock struck one. }</p>
         <p>Her fondness I could well have stinted,</p>
         <p>For, to say truth, she smelt and squinted:</p>
         <p>But I remember'd that she cried,</p>
         <p>When my poor, little Phillis died.</p>
         <p>"I felt my airing rather droll,</p>
         <p>Jogging with _Gripe-all_ cheek-by-jowl,</p>
         <p>And hearing him, with no great awe,</p>
         <p>Expound the secrets of the law.</p>
         <p>--When arriv'd at seven miles' end</p>
         <p>He smil'd and said, 'Good bye, my friend:</p>
         <p>Now homewards you will turn and tell,</p>
         <p>That thus far you have left me well.'</p>
         <p>I left him with a hope, how vain!</p>
         <p>I ne'er might see his face again.</p>
         <p>My spur did sprightly poney goad</p>
         <p>Till I had got into the road</p>
         <p>Which did to Oxford's city lead,</p>
         <p>When I restrain'd my foaming steed,</p>
         <p>And, calmly pacing on my way,</p>
         <p>Ere _Great Tom_ toll'd the following day,</p>
         <p>I had embrac'd my rev'rend friend</p>
         <p>And kindest patron, _Doctor Bend_.</p>
         <p id="jqg03">[Illustration: _Drawn by Rowlandson_</p>
         <p>QUÆ GENUS AT OXFORD.]</p>
         <p>"I told a simple, artless tale,</p>
         <p>That seem'd completely to prevail,</p>
         <p>As I beheld his face the while</p>
         <p>Beam with a kind, approving smile.</p>
         <p>''Tis a bold trick,' the Doctor said,</p>
         <p>'Which you, my lively spark, have play'd,</p>
         <p>But since to College you are come,</p>
         <p>I'll try to make the place your home;</p>
         <p>Where I should hope you need not fear</p>
         <p>To be cut short in your career;</p>
         <p>I think, at least, we may engage</p>
         <p>To keep you safe till you're of age,</p>
         <p>When I shall leave you to the struggling</p>
         <p>With _Gripe-all's_ artifice and juggling:</p>
         <p>But still the cunning lawyer knows</p>
         <p>I have good friends 'mong some of those</p>
         <p>Who lead the bar or have a seat</p>
         <p>Where the keen eye detects a cheat.</p>
         <p>He will, I doubt not, swear and curse,</p>
         <p>Nay, he may say you've stole his horse;</p>
         <p>But if he meets with no disaster,</p>
         <p>In two days he shall see his master,</p>
         <p>And John will have a strict command</p>
         <p>To give a letter to his hand</p>
         <p>Which I shall with due caution write</p>
         <p>Before I seek my bed to-night,</p>
         <p>And if my mental eye sees clear</p>
         <p>Will fix my friend QUÆ GENUS here.'</p>
         <p>John met the lawyer on the road,</p>
         <p>Just as he reach'd his own abode,</p>
         <p>And ere at home he could have heard</p>
         <p>Of my escape a single word:</p>
         <p>Told him at once all he could tell,</p>
         <p>That I at Oxford was, and well,</p>
         <p>Where as I stay'd, I had of course,</p>
         <p>With many thanks return'd his horse,</p>
         <p>John said, he rather look'd confus'd</p>
         <p>As the epistle he perus'd.</p>
         <p>--Whether it bore a kind request</p>
         <p>I should with ALMA MATER rest,</p>
         <p>Or any hint that might apply</p>
         <p>To the High Court of Chancery:</p>
         <p>If soothing it contain'd or threat, }</p>
         <p>I never knew or I forget,-- }</p>
         <p>With all submission it was met. }</p>
         <p>To all it ask'd he did agree,</p>
         <p>And sent his kind regards to me,</p>
         <p>While he his counsel did commend</p>
         <p>Not to run off from _Doctor Bend_,</p>
         <p>Nor e'er be govern'd by the whim</p>
         <p>That made me run away from him.</p>
         <p>"Thus soon in Scholar's cap and gown, }</p>
         <p>I was seen saunt'ring up and down }</p>
         <p>The High-Street of fair Oxford Town. }</p>
         <p>And though I stood not first in fame,</p>
         <p>I never bore an idler's name.</p>
         <p>I was content, nay 'twas my pride</p>
         <p>The Doctor ne'er was heard to chide,</p>
         <p>Which, as your Oxford youths can tell,</p>
         <p>Was getting onward rather well.</p>
         <p>My friends, the WORTHIES, near the Lake,</p>
         <p>Lov'd me for DOCTOR SYNTAX' sake,</p>
         <p>And, free from e'en a speck of care,</p>
         <p>I pass'd a short-liv'd Summer there.</p>
         <p>--But time, as it is us'd, roll'd on,</p>
         <p>And I, at length, was twenty-one.</p>
         <p>"I now became a man of cares</p>
         <p>To bear the weight of my affairs,</p>
         <p>To know my fortune's full amount,</p>
         <p>And to arrange a clear account</p>
         <p>Between the vile, rapacious elf,</p>
         <p>The _Lawyer Gripe-all_ and myself.</p>
         <p>--No sooner to the place I came, }</p>
         <p>Soon as was heard my well-known name, }</p>
         <p>The bells my coming did proclaim, }</p>
         <p>And had I stay'd the following day,</p>
         <p>I would have made the village gay!</p>
         <p>Thus _Gripe-all_ was full well prepar'd</p>
         <p>And put at once upon his guard.</p>
         <p>I went unwittingly alone</p>
         <p>To claim my right and ask my own,</p>
         <p>Though arm'd, to cut the matter short,</p>
         <p>With an enliv'ning dose of Port,</p>
         <p>While he was ready to display</p>
         <p>The spirit of the law's delay.</p>
         <p>--A step, he said, he could not stir</p>
         <p>Without Baptismal Register,</p>
         <p>And many a proof he must receive,</p>
         <p>Which well he knew I could not give;</p>
         <p>And till these papers I could shew,</p>
         <p>He must remain in _Statu quo_.</p>
         <p>But still, as a kind, gen'rous friend,</p>
         <p>And from respect to _Doctor Bend_,</p>
         <p>He would, though cash did not abound,</p>
         <p>Advance me then _four hundred pound_.</p>
         <p>I took the notes and thought it best</p>
         <p>To wait the settling of the rest;</p>
         <p>But soon I saw, as I'm alive,</p>
         <p>That I had sign'd receipt for _five_.</p>
         <p>My fingers caught the fraudful paper,</p>
         <p>At which he 'gan to fume and vapour,</p>
         <p>And let loose language full of ire,</p>
         <p>Such as 'you bastard, rascal, liar,'</p>
         <p>On which I caught him by the nose,</p>
         <p>And gave the wretch some heavy blows,</p>
         <p>Nay, as the blood ran down his face,</p>
         <p>I dash'd the ink all in his face,</p>
         <p>So that his figure might have done</p>
         <p>E'en for the pit of Acheron.</p>
         <p>Inky black and bloody red</p>
         <p>Was o'er his ghastly visage spread,</p>
         <p>As he lay senseless on the floor,</p>
         <p>And, as I then thought, breath'd no more.</p>
         <p>--The office, now a scene of blood,</p>
         <p>Most haply in the garden stood,</p>
         <p>So that our scene of sanguine riot</p>
         <p>Did not disturb domestic quiet:</p>
         <p>The notes were in my pocket stor'd,</p>
         <p>And the receipt was in the hoard;</p>
         <p>But as I now believ'd him dead,</p>
         <p>I thought of being hang'd--and fled.</p>
         <p>Nor did I make the whisky wait</p>
         <p>Which then stood at the garden gate.</p>
         <p>The driver who there held the reins,</p>
         <p>Took me through many secret lanes</p>
         <p>And woodland roads, that might evade</p>
         <p>Pursuit, if any should be made.</p>
         <p>He had an humble play-mate been</p>
         <p>When I was sportive on the green;</p>
         <p>But now, like me, to manhood grown,</p>
         <p>Was as a skilful driver known;</p>
         <p>And would have gone to serve QUÆ GENUS</p>
         <p>Though fire and water were between us.</p>
         <p>I told him all the fears I felt,</p>
         <p>And how I had with _Gripe-all_ dealt;</p>
         <p>Nay, urg'd him, if I were pursued, }</p>
         <p>To cheat the blood-hounds, if he could, }</p>
         <p>All which he mainly swore he would. }</p>
         <p>Nay, hop'd I'd given him such a drubbing,</p>
         <p>As to send him Beelzebubbing;</p>
         <p>Though, first or last, he sure would go</p>
         <p>To his relations down below.</p>

         <p>"Thus as we talk'd a mail-coach pass'd,</p>
         <p>And as I could not go too fast,</p>
         <p>I found, perchance, an empty seat,</p>
         <p>And thus I made a quick retreat;</p>
         <p>Nay should, in eight and forty hours,</p>
         <p>By the wheels' ever-rolling powers,</p>
         <p>Have a secure retirement found,</p>
         <p>Safe from pursuit, on Scottish ground.</p>
         <p>But as Misfortune, it is said,</p>
         <p>Calls in associates to her aid,</p>
         <p>And, indeed, is seldom known</p>
         <p>To pay her visits all alone;</p>
         <p>So either from the sultry weather,</p>
         <p>Or anxious thoughts, or both together,</p>
         <p>I was stopp'd short in my career,</p>
         <p>By intermitting fits severe</p>
         <p>Of heat and cold: a Galen came,</p>
         <p>And Julep was the good man's name,</p>
         <p>For truly good he prov'd to me</p>
         <p>In skill and in humanity.</p>
         <p>''Tis not,' he said, 'disease alone,</p>
         <p>Which various symptoms have made known,</p>
         <p>But they're encreasing as I find,</p>
         <p>By a disturb'd and anxious mind,</p>
         <p>And if that cannot be subdued,</p>
         <p>Med'cine will do but little good.'</p>
         <p>I therefore, my distresses told,</p>
         <p>In short, my story did unfold,</p>
         <p>While, as I spoke, in his kind eye,</p>
         <p>I saw the tear of sympathy,</p>
         <p>And did beneath his roof receive</p>
         <p>The care that pitying skill could give.</p>
         <p>"The fever wag'd a painful strife,</p>
         <p>A struggling chance 'tween Death and Life,</p>
         <p>That play'd upon my yielding spine,</p>
         <p>Which did to outward curve incline:</p>
         <p>I felt the mark would ne'er forsake</p>
         <p>Its cruel seat upon my back;</p>
         <p>I bent beneath the foul disaster</p>
         <p>That ne'er would yield to any plaister:</p>
         <p>Nor medicine, nor knife can cure it,</p>
         <p>And must struggle to endure it.</p>
         <p>Thus when restor'd to health and vigour,</p>
         <p>I was become a crook-back'd figure:</p>
         <p>My former round and healthful face</p>
         <p>Had lost its plump, its rosy grace,</p>
         <p>And was reduc'd from this same cause</p>
         <p>To pale and lean and lantern jaws,</p>
         <p>That none who once QUÆ GENUS knew</p>
         <p>Would recollect him on the view;</p>
         <p>Nor e'en would recognition wait</p>
         <p>Though he should pass by _Gripe-all's_ gate.</p>
         <p>When in the glass I chanc'd to view, }</p>
         <p>The figure I now scarcely knew, }</p>
         <p>I shudder'd and despis'd it too. }</p>
         <p>--'At length,' said _Julep_, 'I commend,</p>
         <p>Ere you depart, a worthy friend,</p>
         <p>A lawyer too, nay, do not start,</p>

         <p>Throughout his life were ne'er disjoin'd,</p>
         <p>And in his practice are combin'd</p>
         <p>The cause of truth and right to aid;</p>
         <p>Who ne'er has heard the poor upbraid</p>
         <p>His conscious dealings, while 'tis known,</p>
         <p>The wealthy do his virtues own.</p>
         <p>Thus, as your fate has been accurs'd,</p>

         <p>Obtain good counsel from the best.</p>
         <p>"On such a character intent,</p>
         <p>To Lawyer _Make-peace_ thus I went,</p>

         <p>With a keen look my face he ey'd,</p>
         <p>And in a gentle tone replied.</p>

         <p>It follows not the man was kill'd:</p>
         <p>Besides, whatever ill was done,</p>
         <p>There was no witness, no not one</p>
         <p>To prove which of you was in fault,</p>
         <p>Who first provok'd or gave th' assault;</p>
         <p>And if, my friend, you had not fled</p>
         <p>You need not fear, though he were dead.</p>
         <p>--No advertisement has appear'd</p>
         <p>To state the crime, as I have heard,</p>

         <p>'No, no,' he said, 'to such as thee</p>
         <p>For mere good words I'm never paid;--</p>
         <p>This is my way of plying trade.</p>
         <p>When you have made a fair escape</p>
         <p>From this unlucky, wretched scrape,</p>
         <p>And when you are again restor'd</p>
         <p>To your own happy bed and board;</p>
         <p>When from all thraldom you are free,</p>
         <p>Then, if it suits, remember me.'</p>
         <p>"My notes were sew'd up in my coat,</p>
         <p>For JULEP would not take a groat.</p>
         <p>'When you reach home,' he kindly said;</p>
         <p>'Like his friend MAKE-PEACE, I'll be paid.'</p>
         <p>Thus I set off, as was my plan,</p>
         <p>Guis'd as a trudging, trav'lling man,</p>
         <p>And in his journey going on</p>
         <p>To seek his fate in London town.</p>
         <p>My needfuls in an oil-cloth sack,</p>
         <p>Were buckled to my wretched back,</p>
         <p>And late at night when the full moon</p>
         <p>In an unclouded brightness shone,</p>
         <p>I left those gen'rous friends behind</p>
         <p>Which such as me so seldom find:</p>
         <p>A Galen, with that goodness fraught,</p>
         <p>Who gave his skill and drugs for nought;</p>
         <p>And an attorney, whose great aim</p>
         <p>Was to put roguery to shame;</p>
         <p>Nay, whose superior virtues tell</p>
         <p>The Law can shew a _Miracle_.</p>
         <p>"You must, _Sir Jeff'ry_, often see }</p>
         <p>The strange effects of vanity; }</p>
         <p>Another you will find in me. }</p>
         <p>You'll scarce believe as I relate</p>
         <p>The folly which I now must state:</p>
         <p>That I've been such a silly elf</p>
         <p>I now can scarce believe myself:</p>
         <p>And I could wish I dare conceal</p>
         <p>What duty bids me to reveal.</p>
         <p>--Did not calm prudence whisper now</p>
         <p>To my existing state to bow,</p>
         <p>To tell it all to such a friend</p>
         <p>As I had found in _Doctor Bend_,</p>
         <p>Or a quick pilgrimage to make }</p>
         <p>To Worthy-Hall beside the Lake, }</p>
         <p>Where, for dear _Doctor Syntax'_ sake, }</p>
         <p>The troubled _Foundling_ would receive</p>
         <p>All that protecting care could give.</p>
         <p>This was the counsel _Make-peace_ gave,</p>
         <p>A lawyer who was not a knave;</p>
         <p>Who would advise without a fee,</p>
         <p>And felt for human misery.</p>
         <p>--This Reason said in lessons strong,</p>
         <p>As I pac'd my still way along,</p>
         <p>When the dull sound of my own feet</p>
         <p>And Philomela's sonnet sweet</p>
         <p>Did on the gen'ral silence break,</p>
         <p>And seem'd to keep the night awake.</p>
         <p>Then VANITY sat pick-a-pack</p>
         <p>Perch'd on the hump upon my back,</p>
         <p>And whisper'd into either ear,</p>
         <p>'Such humbling counsels do not hear.</p>
         <p>Where poor QUÆ GENUS has been known</p>
         <p>His alter'd form must ne'er be shown:</p>
         <p>With this sad shape he never can</p>
         <p>Hold himself forth a gentleman:</p>
         <p>No art can furnish you a cloak</p>
         <p>To hide from pity or from joke.</p>
         <p>If passing on a river's ridge,</p>
         <p>Or, perchance lolling o'er a bridge,</p>
         <p>You gaze upon the stream below</p>
         <p>Whose crystal mirror's seen to flow,</p>
         <p>Would not the picture meet your eye</p>
         <p>Of your own sad deformity?</p>
         <p>At Oxford you would be the talk</p>
         <p>Of the High-street or Christ-Church-walk,</p>
         <p>While many quizzing fools look round</p>
         <p>To view your rising back begown'd.</p>
         <p>--How would you bear the wond'ring ken</p>
         <p>Of the good folk of Sommerden,</p>
         <p>While they with pitying looks lament</p>
         <p>The once straight form, but now so bent!</p>
         <p>Then leave the world where you have been,</p>
         <p>Where I would be no longer seen,</p>
         <p>Nor let the jealous eye compare,</p>
         <p>What you once was with what you are.</p>
         <p>Might I advise, I'd sooner die }</p>
         <p>Unknown, in humble privacy, }</p>
         <p>Again,' said whisp'ring vanity, }</p>
         <p>'Than e'er appear where I was known</p>
         <p>For graces which were then my own,</p>
         <p>That pity or that scorn might point</p>
         <p>At such a form, so out of joint.'</p>
         <p>"I need not say how many days</p>
         <p>I sought the bye and secret ways,</p>
         <p>For ever list'ning to the tongue }</p>
         <p>That whisper'd soft and pleaded strong, }</p>
         <p>To set each better feeling wrong. }</p>
         <p>Hence I resign'd myself to chance,</p>
         <p>Left fortune, friends, inheritance,</p>
         <p>And madly felt that I was hurl'd</p>
         <p>Thus mark'd to wander through the world.</p>
         <p>To snatch at, and at once receive,</p>
         <p>Whate'er the world might chance to give.</p>
         <p>'Twas not a whimsy of the brain, }</p>
         <p>That did the idle scheme sustain, }</p>
         <p>'Twas something which I can't explain. }</p>
         <p>All feeling center'd in the pack</p>
         <p>That had thus risen on my back;</p>
         <p>And as I felt the burden there,</p>
         <p>It seem'd the seat of ev'ry care,</p>
         <p>Of ev'ry painful thought brimfull,</p>
         <p>Like OLD PANDORA'S _Ridicule_.</p>
         <p>But as every single note }</p>
         <p>Which I from _Gripe-all's_ grasp had got, }</p>
         <p>Was still secure within my coat, }</p>
         <p>I had sufficient means and more</p>
         <p>To travel all the kingdom o'er</p>
         <p>With staff in hand, and well-shod feet, }</p>
         <p>And oil'd umbrella form'd to meet }</p>
         <p>The show'rs that might my passage greet. }</p>
         <p>One pocket did a bible hold,</p>
         <p>The other held the story told,</p>
         <p>Which good Æneas did rehearse</p>
         <p>To Dido, in immortal verse;</p>
         <p>While from a loop before descended</p>
         <p>A flute that oft my hours befriended:</p>
         <p>Thus I with verse, with prose or fist,</p>
         <p>Was scholar, fiddler, methodist.</p>
         <p>As fit occasion might demand,</p>
         <p>I could let Scripture Phrase off-hand,</p>
         <p>Or fine re-sounding verses quote,</p>
         <p>Or play a tune in lively note.</p>
         <p>Thus qualified to cut and carve,</p>
         <p>I need not fear that I should starve;</p>
         <p>While in some future lucky stage</p>
         <p>Of my uncertain pilgrimage,</p>
         <p>I might have hopes, remov'd from strife,</p>
         <p>To be a fixture for my life.</p>
         <p>"Such was the wild, fantastic scheme</p>
         <p>Such was the strange distracted dream,</p>
         <p>That, stranger still, rose from the pack</p>
         <p>Which chance had fix'd upon my back.</p>
         <p>Of friends forgetful, 'twas my plot</p>
         <p>That I by friends should be forgot.--</p>
         <p>I seem'd to wish that I were thrown</p>
         <p>Upon some island yet unknown,</p>
         <p>Where crooked figure is the feature</p>
         <p>Of all the living, reas'ning nature;</p>
         <p>And where deformity would be</p>
         <p>A shape of perfect symmetry;</p>
         <p>Which SWIFT would not have fail'd to spare,</p>
         <p>Had his bold fancy wander'd there,</p>
         <p>And _Lemuel Gulliver_ had been</p>
         <p>The visitor of such a scene.</p>
         <p>"In this same state I wander'd on,</p>
         <p>Grumbling and doubting and alone,</p>
         <p>Though some encouragement I met</p>
         <p>Which made me whilom cease to fret;</p>
         <p>For, tales I hap'd by chance to know</p>
         <p>And pleasant fancies I could show,</p>
         <p>With which my active mind was stor'd,</p>
         <p>Had sometimes paid my bed and board;</p>
         <p>Nay, had prolong'd my welcome stay</p>
         <p>Throughout a grave or lively day.</p>
         <p>"One evening by a riv'let's side</p>
         <p>That did in gentle murmurs glide,</p>
         <p>Where the green turf its carpet spread,</p>
         <p>And willow boughs wav'd o'er my head,</p>
         <p>I sat reclin'd, nor was my flute,</p>
         <p>As I could wake its music, mute:</p>
         <p>When a huge waggon pass'd along,</p>
         <p>And soon a chorus join'd the song.</p>
         <p>Invited by the social strain,</p>
         <p>I rose and sought the jocund train;</p>
         <p>Men, women, children, all so gay,</p>
         <p>Who loudly cheer'd the tedious way.</p>
         <p>The cargo which the waggon bore</p>
         <p>Were modern times and those of yore;</p>
         <p>The image of each living scene,</p>
         <p>And of such things as ne'er had been:</p>
         <p>Witches and goblins, clouds and skies</p>
         <p>Deck'd out in their varieties,</p>
         <p>The river's flow, the ocean's waves,</p>
         <p>The crowns of kings, the bonds of slaves,</p>
         <p>Helmets and mitres, robes and arms,</p>
         <p>Terrific forms, and beauty's charms,</p>
         <p>All mov'd along, together hurl'd,</p>
         <p>Th' outfittings of a mimic world:</p>
         <p>When what with spouting, what with song,</p>
         <p>As the procession trudg'd along,</p>
         <p>No cunning was required to see,</p>
         <p>It was a strolling company,</p>
         <p>Who were proceeding to make known</p>
         <p>Their talents in a neighb'ring town.</p>
         <p>Here a strange thought occur'd that I</p>
         <p>Might try my powers in Tragedy;</p>
         <p>While the vain fancy was possess'd</p>
         <p>I might appear among the best:</p>
         <p>In short among them I display'd</p>
         <p>An earnest of the acting trade.</p>
         <p>The bills were blazon'd with my name,</p>
         <p>A candidate for scenic fame,</p>
         <p>And 'twas announc'd that Mr. Page</p>
         <p>Would first appear on any stage.</p>
         <p>The part which I of course preferr'd</p>
         <p>Was SHAKESPEAR'S well known R. the THIRD.</p>
         <p>I wanted not the wardrobe's aid,</p>
         <p>My crook-back was already made;</p>
         <p>My form disdain'd the aid of art,</p>
         <p>And thus I play'd the tyrant's part:</p>
         <p>But from my being thus disjoin'd,</p>
         <p>To this same part I was confin'd.</p>
         <p>Though by this outfit I must own</p>
         <p>I could perform the awkward clown,</p>
         <p>Or any other hunch-back fellow,</p>
         <p>A Pantaloon, or Punchinello,</p>
         <p>Where white and red be-mark'd my face,</p>
         <p>And excellence was my disgrace:</p>
         <p>For here I shrunk beneath the pack</p>
         <p>That fate had nail'd upon my back.</p>
         <p>"I wish'd to figure as Othello,</p>
         <p>But he was a fine, straight-made fellow,</p>
         <p>Whom, with a shape, so crook'd, so bent,</p>
         <p>I could not dare to represent,</p>
         <p>And though his face was olive brown,</p>
         <p>No injury his form had known;</p>
         <p>While mine, in its unseemly guise,</p>
         <p>Fair Desdemona must despise:</p>
         <p>Nor could it be a bard's design, }</p>
         <p>That love-sick maids should e'er incline }</p>
         <p>To such an outrag'd shape as mine. }</p>
         <p>My voice possess'd a tender strain,</p>
         <p>That could express a lover's pain;</p>
         <p>But such a figure never yet</p>
         <p>Was seen to win a _Juliet_.</p>
         <p>Nay ladies lolling in a box,</p>
         <p>Would think it a most curious hoax,</p>
         <p>If through their glasses they should see</p>
         <p>Lord Townly such an imp as me.</p>
         <p>Thus for a month or more, JACK PAGE</p>
         <p>Fretted and strutted on the stage,</p>
         <p>Sometimes affording Richard's figure</p>
         <p>In all its native twist and vigour;</p>
         <p>Or bearing kick, or smack, or thump</p>
         <p>From Harlequin upon his hump.</p>
         <p>Though I say not, I was ill-paid</p>
         <p>For the fine acting I display'd.</p>
         <p>Nay, had I less mis-shapen been,</p>
         <p>I might to the Theatric scene,</p>
         <p>Have turn'd my strange life's future views,</p>
         <p>And courted the Dramatic Muse.</p>
         <p>"But as I could not smooth my shape</p>
         <p>From the hips upwards to the nape,</p>
         <p>And as to so confin'd a round</p>
         <p>My imitative powers were bound,</p>
         <p>My Genius I resolv'd to try</p>
         <p>In writing Farce or Comedy,</p>
         <p>In which I could exert my art</p>
         <p>For my dear self to form a part</p>
         <p>Wherein the keen, applauding eye</p>
         <p>Might dwell on my deformity,</p>
         <p>And where the picture might beguile</p>
         <p>The judgement to afford a smile.</p>
         <p>--When this same work I had perform'd</p>
         <p>My vanity was rather warm'd.</p>
         <p>'Humour,' 'twas said, 'the piece discovers,'</p>
         <p>And it was call'd, 'The Crooked Lovers.'</p>
         <p>"I think, _Sir Jeff'ry_ you may guess, }</p>
         <p>The plot my Farce aims to possess,-- }</p>
         <p>A kind of praise of ugliness; }</p>
         <p>Where Beauty is not seen to charm,</p>
         <p>Nor fill the heart with fond alarm;</p>
         <p>Where finest eyes may gleam in vain,</p>
         <p>May wake no joy, or give no pain:</p>
         <p>And though the beaming smiles may grace</p>
         <p>The rosy bloom of Delia's face,</p>
         <p>Here they excite no am'rous passion,</p>
         <p>Nor call forth tender inclination:</p>
         <p>Such the desire, that ev'ry day,</p>
         <p>Amuses Cupid when at play,</p>
         <p>But other objects must engage</p>
         <p>The scenes I offer'd to the stage:</p>
         <p>Lame legs, club feet, and blinking eyes,</p>
         <p>With such like eccentricities,</p>
         <p>Call'd forth my amorous desire,</p>
         <p>And set my actors all on fire.</p>
         <p>With me no Damon longs to sip</p>
         <p>The sweets of Cath'rine's pouting lip,</p>
         <p>But smoke-dried Strephon seeks the bliss</p>
         <p>Of a well-guarded, snuffy kiss,</p>
         <p>Where the long nose, delightful wonder,</p>
         <p>Scarce from the chin can keep asunder;</p>
         <p>Where lovers' hearts ne'er feel a thump,</p>
         <p>But when they view each other's hump.</p>
         <p>"Now here again I was o'erthrown</p>
         <p>By a crook-back, and not my own;</p>
         <p>The May'rs gay wife, whose back appears</p>
         <p>Upon a level with her ears,</p>
         <p>Was pleas'd at first that I had prov'd</p>
         <p>She was an object to be lov'd;</p>
         <p>But as the Parish Parson too,</p>
         <p>With a small form was quite askew,</p>
         <p>And as, when it was pleasant weather,</p>
         <p>This pair would take a walk together,</p>
         <p>Would saunter through the winding glade,</p>
         <p>Or sit beneath the beechen shade;</p>
         <p>And, as it seem'd, were never cloy'd</p>
         <p>With tender converse so enjoy'd;</p>
         <p>It hap'd some Critic keen discovers</p>
         <p>Whom I meant by 'The Crooked Lovers.'</p>
         <p>The May'ress call'd th' obedient Mayor</p>
         <p>To frown from magisterial chair,</p>
         <p>And with the terrors of his mace</p>
         <p>To drive my Hunch-back from the place;--</p>
         <p>And on the high-road I once more</p>
         <p>Was trav'lling as I did before.</p>
         <p>"To you, Sir, it was never known</p>
         <p>To feel the state which I must own:</p>
         <p>No home, not knowing where to go,</p>
         <p>How I should act and what to do.</p>
         <p>Just as a ship whose rudder's lost,</p>
         <p>Nor within sight of any coast;</p>
         <p>Without the power to stand the shock</p>
         <p>Of tempest, or to shun the rock.</p>
         <p>From the strange nature of my birth,</p>
         <p>I knew no relative on earth,</p>
         <p>Nor to my giddy thoughts was given</p>
         <p>To look with any hope to Heaven.</p>
         <p>To London I propos'd to go,</p>
         <p>Where not a being did I know:</p>
         <p>To me it was an unknown shore,</p>
         <p>Where I had never been before,</p>
         <p>At least, since of all care bereft,</p>
         <p>I was a helpless Foundling left.</p>
         <p>Thus, as I thought, behold I stood,</p>
         <p>Beside a mill-dam's spreading flood;</p>
         <p>The waters form'd to drive the mill }</p>
         <p>With its tremendous wheel, stood still, }</p>
         <p>While evening glimmer'd on the hill. }</p>
         <p>One plunge I said and all is o'er,</p>
         <p>My hopes and fears will be no more;</p>
         <p>An unknown child, an unknown man,</p>
         <p>And I shall end as I began.</p>
         <p>Nor can I say what would have follow'd,</p>
         <p>I, and my hump, might have been swallow'd</p>
         <p>In the deep, wat'ry gulph beneath,</p>
         <p>Had I not heard a hautbois breath</p>
         <p>A lively, but an uncouth strain,</p>
         <p>As it appear'd from rustic swain,</p>
         <p>Which, as it dwelt upon my ear,</p>
         <p>Told me that merriment was near,</p>
         <p>And did at once dispel the gloom</p>
         <p>That might have sought a wat'ry tomb.</p>
         <p>I turn'd my footsteps tow'rds the sound</p>
         <p>That was now heard the valley round;</p>
         <p>When soon upon the rural green,</p>
         <p>The sight of busy mirth was seen.</p>

         <p>"With sights like these, I had been us'd</p>
         <p>In early days to be amus'd</p>
         <p>When I but wav'd my boyish hand</p>
         <p>The rural groupes obey'd command,</p>
         <p>When ev'ry rustic feast I grac'd</p>
         <p>And was in highest station plac'd,</p>
         <p>Though I did to no name aspire,</p>
         <p>Yet I was nam'd the youthful 'Squire,</p>
         <p>For Madam Syntax sake was shown</p>
         <p>The honour which was not my own.</p>
         <p>But now, such was my fortune's change,</p>
         <p>A wand'rer I was left to range</p>
         <p>I scarce knew where, and doom'd to wait</p>
         <p>For what might be my future fate.</p>
         <p>Thus I approach'd the busy throng,</p>
         <p>And when I heard the joyous song,</p>
         <p>Though, with a mingled sense of pain,</p>
         <p>My flute pour'd forth a doubtful strain.</p>
         <p>--'Twas a sheep-shearing that employ'd</p>
         <p>The festive toil which all enjoy'd,</p>
         <p>And I was welcom'd to receive</p>
         <p>The bounties that the feast could give;</p>
         <p>And while I did my carols play,</p>
         <p>With flowers the maidens made me gay,</p>
         <p>And as they gave my back a thump,</p>
         <p>Each stuck a nosegay on my hump.</p>
         <p>Here I must own, there's no concealing,</p>
         <p>These compliments attack'd my feeling,</p>
         <p>And I was deck'd out in a part,</p>
         <p>Which on my back, was near my heart;</p>
         <p>Yet, as sweet smiles shew'd the intent</p>
         <p>That no offensive thought was meant,</p>
         <p>I, with kind words and sprightly tune</p>
         <p>Strove to repay the fragrant boon.</p>
         <p>--The yeoman, master of the feast,</p>
         <p>Was kind, and own'd me as his guest,</p>
         <p>And as he view'd each added fleece</p>
         <p>That did his summer wealth encrease,</p>
         <p>He joyous made the toast go round</p>
         <p>To the song's animating sound,</p>
         <p>While the patient ewes grown light,</p>
         <p>And eas'd of all their fleecy weight,</p>
         <p>No more the shearer's hand restrain</p>
         <p>But bound off to their hills again.</p>
         <p>Such was the scene that did awhile</p>
         <p>My bosom of its cares beguile,</p>
         <p>For he must have a wretched heart</p>
         <p>To whom those joys no joy impart,</p>
         <p>Which others are beheld to feel</p>
         <p>And to th' attentive eye reveal;</p>
         <p>Nay, I must own that this night's pleasure,</p>
         <p>Which revell'd in unbounded measure,</p>
         <p>A kind, though short, oblivion shed</p>
         <p>O'er my crook-back and thoughtful head:</p>
         <p>Yes, brief it was, for soon again</p>
         <p>My pleasure yielded to my pain,</p>
         <p>And all the jocund, festive folly</p>
         <p>Was then restor'd to melancholy.</p>
         <p>The ale was good, my draughts were deep,</p>
         <p>And, overcome by sudden sleep,</p>
         <p>Upon a chair my head repos'd,</p>
         <p>And soon my eyes were soundly clos'd.</p>
         <p>Th' Exciseman, a smart, parish wit,</p>
         <p>Thought he could make a funny hit,</p>
         <p>And with his ochre red and black,</p>
         <p>Drew a fierce face upon my back,</p>
         <p>The thought, at least, was not quite civil,</p>
         <p>With all the emblems of the devil.</p>
         <p>He had display'd his humour's art</p>
         <p>Upon a very tender part,</p>
         <p>At least, my pride, as you must know,</p>
         <p>Had to my fancy made it so.</p>
         <p>When, by the roar caus'd by the joke,</p>
         <p>I from the slumb'ring fit awoke;</p>
         <p>Soon did I make th' Exciseman sick</p>
         <p>Of such a mortifying trick:</p>
         <p>His gauging-rod was heard to crack</p>
         <p>In many a stroke upon his back,</p>
         <p>Till, by his supplicating tone,</p>
         <p>I found I had aveng'd my own.</p>
         <p>But though the marks were brush'd with care,</p>
         <p>By the same hand which trac'd them there;</p>
         <p>And though I was most warmly prest,</p>
         <p>By the kind master of the feast,</p>
         <p>To pass another jovial day;</p>
         <p>I felt offence and walk'd away.</p>
         <p>"'Do what I can, go where I will,</p>
         <p>This Hump's my evil genius still,</p>

         <p>--Such was th' expression that my tongue</p>

         <p>And still be pleas'd you cannot trace</p>
         <p>Any mis-givings on your face.</p>
         <p>The change you surely would not try</p>

         <p>All's right before, so never mind</p>
         <p>A certain awkwardness behind;</p>

         <p>No eye can see a blemish on't.</p>
         <p>With merry and good-humour'd folk,</p>
         <p>Treat it, Oh treat it as a joke,</p>

         <p>Who turns it into ridicule,</p>
         <p>Tell him you'd rather have the feature,</p>
         <p>Coarse as it is, than his ill-nature.</p>
         <p>Take care that none who know you, find</p>
         <p>An awkward hump within your mind:</p>
         <p>Oh, let it be your constant care</p>
         <p>To banish disproportion there,</p>
         <p>And you will laugh with friends who crack</p>

         <p>The beast I, with some trouble, caught,</p>

         <p>It might the happy shape destroy</p>

         <p>And then thought proper to begin. }</p>
         <p>"By a great writer it is said,</p>
         <p>And one who seldom was betray'd,</p>
         <p>When he employ'd his tongue or pen</p>
         <p>On the known characters of men:</p>
         <p>(And if, perchance, I'm not mistaken,</p>
         <p>I think his famous name was BACON,)</p>
         <p>That in the changeful scenes of life,</p>
         <p>Which raise up enmity and strife,</p>
         <p>He may 'gainst others hold his head,</p>
         <p>Nor the wide world's opinion dread,</p>
         <p>If, though he almost stands alone,</p>
         <p>An honest heart maintains its own:</p>
         <p>But that he is an arrant fool</p>
         <p>Who yields to his own ridicule.</p>
         <p>Now such a fool, as we have seen,</p>
         <p>QUÆ GENUS, from weak pride, has been:</p>
         <p>But, though I wonder at his folly,</p>
         <p>I will not make him melancholy.</p>
         <p>"Things at the worst, 'tis said, must mend,</p>
         <p>And I will prove your real friend,</p>
         <p>If you, hereafter, have the sense</p>
         <p>To merit my full confidence:</p>
         <p>And now, I think, you may prepare</p>
         <p>To take my household to your care.</p>
         <p>Your pride must not offended be</p>
         <p>At putting on a livery,</p>
         <p>As that will be the best disguise</p>
         <p>To hide you from all prying eyes;</p>
         <p>QUÆ GENUS, too, you now must yield,</p>
         <p>That learned name should be conceal'd;</p>
         <p>_Ezekiel_ will suspicion smother,</p>
         <p>As well, I think, as any other,</p>
         <p>Till I have due enquiry made</p>
         <p>If _Gripe-all_ be alive or dead,</p>
         <p>And how far I may recommend</p>
         <p>The runaway to _Doctor Bend_.</p>
         <p>Do what is right--and laugh at fear;</p>
         <p>The mark you carry in your rear</p>
         <p>Will never intercept the view</p>
         <p>Fortune may have in store for you.</p>
         <p>No more let vanity resent</p>
         <p>The stroke by which your form is bent!</p>
         <p>How many in the world's wide range</p>
         <p>Would willingly their figures change</p>
         <p>For such as yours, and give their wealth</p>
         <p>To get your hump and all its health.</p>
         <p>Look at my legs--my stomach see,</p>
         <p>And tell me, would you change with me?</p>
         <p>Nay, when your healthy form I view, }</p>
         <p>Though all be-hump'd, I'd change with you, }</p>
         <p>And give you half my fortune too. }</p>
         <p>Lament no more your loss of beauty,</p>
         <p>But give your thoughts to do that duty</p>
         <p>Which my peculiar wants require,</p>
         <p>And more you need not to desire.</p>
         <p>I feel I cannot pay too high</p>
         <p>For care and for fidelity:</p>
         <p>Let me see that--my heart engages</p>
         <p>To give you something more than wages</p>
         <p>--Your duties will be found to vary,</p>
         <p>As Steward, Nurse, and Secretary:</p>
         <p>Thus you will soon my wants attend</p>
         <p>Less as a servant than a friend.</p>
         <p>You may suppose I little know</p>
         <p>Of what is going on below;</p>
         <p>My leading wishes are, to prove</p>
         <p>That I am duly serv'd above,</p>
         <p>And you, as may be daily seen,</p>

         <p>Nay, 'tis such folly to be lying,</p>
         <p>And all these trifling tricks denying,</p>
         <p>Which, ere a fortnight's past and over,</p>
         <p>Mr. _Ezekiel_ must discover.</p>
         <p>_Sir Jeff'ry's_ keen look never sees</p>
         <p>What are but clever servants' fees,</p>
         <p>And he would feel it to his sorrow,</p>
         <p>Were he to change us all to-morrow;</p>
         <p>For the new steward soon will see</p>
         <p>No master's better serv'd than he.</p>
         <p>There's not a carriage about town</p>
         <p>That looks genteeler than our own;</p>
         <p>Or horses with more sprightly air,</p>
         <p>Trot through the street or round a square.</p>
         <p>I say that we all do our duty,</p>
         <p>And if we make a little booty,</p>
         <p>We never hear _Sir Jeff._ complain:</p>
         <p>And wherefore should one give him pain?</p>
         <p>If better servants he should seek,</p>
         <p>He must be changing ev'ry week;</p>
         <p>And I am sure that kind of strife</p>
         <p>Would spoil the quiet of his life:</p>
         <p>Nay, as you know, there is no question</p>
         <p>Would operate on his digestion;</p>
         <p>And when that fails, it is a point</p>
         <p>That puts the rest all out of joint.</p>
         <p>Thus all our trifling, secret gains</p>
         <p>Save him a multitude of pains:</p>
         <p>And when our daily work is done,</p>
         <p>If we kick up a little fun,</p>
         <p>No harm proceeds--no ill is meant--</p>
         <p>He's not disturb'd--and all's content.</p>
         <p>--Nay, now my friends, I'll club my shilling,</p>
         <p>And you, I'm sure, will be as willing</p>
         <p>To drink--that bus'ness may go on</p>
         <p>In the same temper it has done,</p>
         <p>And, without any treach'rous bother,</p>
         <p>That we may understand each other:</p>
         <p>That, without boasting or denying,</p>
         <p>We need not to continue lying;</p>
         <p>And that, disdaining needless fuss,</p>
         <p>_Ezekiel_ may be one of us."</p>
         <p>The wine was brought, for vulgar beer</p>
         <p>Was not thought proper to appear;</p>
         <p>The cook a pigeon pie produc'd,</p>
         <p>And other tit-bits that amus'd</p>
         <p>The appetites of those who sought 'em,</p>
         <p>With thanks to the fat dame who brought 'em.</p>
         <p>--Thus the new steward was made free</p>
         <p>Of kitchen hospitality;</p>
         <p>And to be blind to what he saw,</p>
         <p>He was bound down by kitchen law.</p>
         <p>At length, in office thus install'd,</p>
         <p>And each was gone where duty call'd,</p>
         <p>He, with a pressing arm, embrac'd }</p>
         <p>The busy cook's well-fatten'd waist, }</p>
         <p>As with her pin she plied the paste; }</p>
         <p>When from her active tongue he drew</p>
         <p>The duties which he had to do,</p>
         <p>And how he might their claims divide,</p>
         <p>Nor lean too much to either side.</p>
         <p>--Our hero, who now felt his ground,</p>
         <p>Thought not of change in what he found;</p>
         <p>And that to enter on reform</p>
         <p>Would be but to excite a storm,</p>
         <p>Disturb the Knight's desir'd repose</p>
         <p>And fill a kitchen full of foes.</p>
         <p>He plainly saw his station bound him</p>
         <p>To be at peace with all around him:</p>
         <p>But, as the diff'rent int'rests drew,</p>
         <p>He rather trembled at the view.</p>
         <p>Thus, if we may small things compare</p>
         <p>With those which more important are,</p>
         <p>We may _Ezekiel's_ state apply</p>
         <p>To maxims of philosophy,</p>
         <p>By which it seems life's changeful hours</p>
         <p>Are subject to two adverse powers,</p>
         <p>That govern as by time or chance,</p>
         <p>Nay, struggle for predominance;</p>
         <p>While each, at diff'rent hours, may be</p>
         <p>Possess'd of short-liv'd victory,</p>
         <p>As varying impulses may bind</p>
         <p>The operations of the mind.</p>
         <p>Here selfish int'rest will prevail--</p>
         <p>There gen'rous feeling turns the scale;</p>
         <p>So that he neither can be said</p>
         <p>Strictly to be or good or bad;</p>
         <p>But in the one or other sense,</p>
         <p>Of that presiding influence</p>
         <p>Which counteracting views may give,</p>
         <p>And the complying mind receive.</p>
         <p>Thus, subject to these adverse powers,</p>
         <p>In diff'rent places--diff'rent hours--</p>
         <p>Poor mortal man, by their constraint,</p>
         <p>May be a sinner or a saint.</p>
         <p>To day he's wading to the chin</p>
         <p>In folly's stream, through thick and thin;</p>
         <p>While, on the morrow, he may prove</p>
         <p>What virtue's self delights to love.</p>
         <p>'Twas in this case our hero stood:</p>
         <p>He might be bad--he might be good;</p>
         <p>If good, he must the kitchen sweep--</p>
         <p>If bad, its tricks a secret keep;</p>
         <p>But if he would preserve his cloth,</p>
         <p>He must determine to be both.</p>
         <p>Thus, as he took a thoughtful view, }</p>
         <p>He saw, his int'rest to pursue, }</p>
         <p>He must divide himself in two. }</p>
         <p>Above to stick to rigid plan--</p>
         <p>Below to join the lively clan:</p>
         <p>In what _Sir Jeff'ry_ did entrust</p>
         <p>To his sole province, to be just;</p>
         <p>But ne'er to interrupt the show</p>
         <p>That was kept up by friends below:</p>
         <p>At least, he was resolv'd to try</p>
         <p>This system of philosophy;</p>
         <p>To be a favourite with all,</p>
         <p>In drawing room and servants' hall.</p>
         <p>From all that he at present view'd,</p>
         <p>No other plan could be pursu'd;</p>
         <p>No other method could he trace,</p>
         <p>To be at ease and keep his place.</p>
         <p>Up-stairs to serious care he went, }</p>
         <p>Down-stairs to stolen merriment, }</p>
         <p>And thus the day and night were spent. }</p>
         <p>_Sir Jeff'ry_, in a tone of pleasure,</p>
         <p>Talk'd of _Ezekiel_ as a treasure;</p>
         <p>And, far as the good Knight could tell,</p>
         <p>He merited the title well:</p>
         <p>Nay, it is true, he never fail'd</p>
         <p>To meet the humour that prevail'd;</p>
         <p>And through the day, from morn till night,</p>
         <p>_Sir Jeff'ry_ found that all was right.</p>
         <p>But when he slumb'ring sought his bed,</p>
         <p>And on the pillow laid his head,</p>
         <p>Then did our hero quit his post</p>
         <p>And pass away like midnight ghost;</p>
         <p>Then did he from his virtue move,</p>
         <p>The power that rul'd him when above,</p>
         <p>And seek the lively sports below;</p>
         <p>For what could puzzled hunch-back do?</p>
         <p>Could he another course prefer?</p>
         <p>No,--he must take things as they were.</p>

         <p>Still, some examples may be shown</p>
         <p>Of those whose virtues would disown</p>
         <p>Its influence, and refuse to fly,</p>
         <p>Or yield the palm of victory.</p>
         <p>But where's the heart that e'er disdains</p>
         <p>The pow'r that dwells where beauty reigns?</p>
         <p>If such a question we propose,</p>
         <p>_Ezekiel_ was not one of those;</p>
         <p>And thus below-stairs he began</p>
         <p>To break upon his up-stairs plan:</p>
         <p>Nay, this same rigid rule of right, }</p>
         <p>In his close duties to the Knight, }</p>
         <p>He now thought might be drawn too tight; }</p>
         <p>And that, in trifles, to his feeling,</p>
         <p>He might be safe in double dealing,</p>
         <p>And in the drawing-room apply</p>
         <p>The aid of kitchen policy:</p>
         <p>But he as soon would think of murther</p>
         <p>As to proceed an atom further.</p>
         <p>How he thus happen'd to decline</p>
         <p>From his strict, philosophic line;</p>
         <p>Why he relax'd from law severe</p>
         <p>In the Knight's upper atmosphere,</p>
         <p>Will not surprise one human creature</p>
         <p>Who the world knows, or human nature,</p>
         <p>Or recollects the joy or smart</p>
         <p>When passion first invades the heart.</p>
         <p>There were two objects most bewitching,</p>
         <p>That sparkled all around the kitchen;</p>
         <p>Though so bright was every kettle,</p>
         <p>Or plate or pan of various metal,</p>
         <p>That each might gaze upon a face</p>
         <p>As if they peep'd into a glass:</p>
         <p>Though fire-irons did reveal</p>
         <p>The shining of the polish'd steel,--</p>
         <p>Yet these superior pow'rs display'd,</p>
         <p>Than aught by human artist made:</p>
         <p>In short, to state what they could be,</p>
         <p>And silence curiosity,</p>
         <p>They were two eyes which lustre shed</p>
         <p>Where'er the owner turn'd her head;</p>
         <p>Though they gave not the only grace</p>
         <p>That play'd on Molly's charming face.</p>
         <p>But whether 'twas her lips or nose,</p>
         <p>Or the fine curve of auburn brows,</p>
         <p>That aided the commanding eye</p>
         <p>In its well-play'd artillery,</p>
         <p>Howe'er that be--in his warm heart</p>
         <p>_Ezekiel_ had receiv'd the dart,</p>
         <p>And as its ruling power he felt,</p>
         <p>Each steady purpose 'gan to melt:--</p>
         <p>For her he might his virtue stake }</p>
         <p>And let his yielding conscience quake, }</p>
         <p>Nay, cheat _Sir Jeff'ry_ for her sake. }</p>
         <p>'Tis not the office of the Muse,</p>
         <p>On slight suspicions, to accuse;</p>
         <p>Nor does she now present to view</p>
         <p>More than 'tis probable she knew:</p>
         <p>But one day, and it may be more,</p>
         <p>His constant meal of dainties o'er,</p>
         <p>Dull nature did the Knight incline</p>
         <p>To snore a little o'er his wine.</p>
         <p>Our hero, seeing Molly pass,</p>
         <p>He tempted her to take a glass;</p>
         <p>For, in his state of tender feeling,</p>
         <p>What gen'rous mind will call it stealing?</p>
         <p>And scorn'd be they who think it treason</p>
         <p>Against the better rules of reason,</p>
         <p>If, in return, he sought a kiss;</p>
         <p>But as he seiz'd the melting bliss,</p>
         <p>Tall Margery was passing by</p>
         <p>By chance or curiosity:</p>
         <p>She glanc'd at all was onward going,</p>
         <p>And what _Ezekiel_ was bestowing;</p>
         <p>When, as she cast her leering eye,</p>
         <p>Thus thought her rising jealousy.</p>
         <p>"If, Sir, you give Miss Moll the glass,</p>
         <p>I'll try to make a bottle pass;"</p>
         <p>Then push'd her stout arm by the door,</p>
         <p>The sideboard's juices to explore.</p>
         <p>If 'twas by chance the action came,</p>
         <p>Or if a purpos'd trick's to blame,</p>
         <p>A smart kick caus'd the door to close</p>
         <p>And caught the damsel by the nose.</p>
         <p>The luckless nose was rather long,</p>
         <p>And had its gristle not been strong,</p>
         <p>Had not the door been edg'd with baize</p>
         <p>To give its hurried motion ease,--</p>
         <p>Had it been sharp, the wicked pinch</p>
         <p>Might have cut short that nose an inch.</p>
         <p>_Madge_ now scream'd out at her disaster, }</p>
         <p>And swore that she would tell her master, }</p>
         <p>But our _Ezekiel_ found a plaister; }</p>
         <p>Though what the plaister was he found</p>
         <p>To silence tongues and cure the wound,</p>
         <p>We must not nice enquiry make</p>
         <p>For virtue's and our hero's sake.</p>
         <p>But we may tell, for this we know,</p>
         <p>That all was still and calm below;</p>
         <p>Though as the faithful verse will prove</p>
         <p>He shap'd another plan above,</p>
         <p>Form'd to controul all household feud,</p>
         <p>And be as honest as he could;</p>
         <p>Thus give to things another face</p>
         <p>To live at ease and keep his place.</p>
         <p>--Two int'rests into one were thrown,</p>
         <p>Those of _Sir Jeff'ry_ and his own:</p>
         <p>The former strictly to maintain,</p>
         <p>Nor yet the latter to disdain;</p>
         <p>The Knight's confiding grace to keep,</p>
         <p>Nor let his own advantage sleep;</p>
         <p>The kitchen's jovial mirth to boast,</p>
         <p>But leave the cook to rule the roast;</p>
         <p>To be of Molly's smiles possest,</p>
         <p>Though never to offend the rest:</p>
         <p>And here we fear is the beginning,</p>
         <p>The first short lesson of his sinning.</p>
         <p>So young, and with such little sense</p>
         <p>Of what is call'd--experience;</p>
         <p>And whom the world had not yet taught,</p>
         <p>As it might do, to set at nought</p>
         <p>What conscience tells us we should shun,</p>
         <p>What we should do or leave undone;</p>
         <p>Or, with a certain self-deceit,</p>
         <p>The virtues of the heart to cheat,</p>
         <p>He certainly appears to be</p>
         <p>Envelop'd in perplexity,</p>
         <p>And verging on a dang'rous scrape</p>
         <p>From which he might not make escape</p>
         <p>Without a loss which he would rue</p>
         <p>Of the fair prospects in his view;</p>
         <p>And thus be on a sudden hurl'd</p>
         <p>Faithless and friendless on the world.</p>
         <p>As in his plan this hasty change</p>
         <p>Was, it may seem, so very strange,</p>
         <p>It therefore may be well to know</p>
         <p>From whence such awkward motives flow,</p>
         <p>For awkward motives they must be</p>
         <p>Which trench upon integrity.</p>
         <p>It was not Molly's sparkling eyes</p>
         <p>Which sought his virtue to surprise;</p>
         <p>For though he might her heart beguile</p>
         <p>To yield his wish a fav'ring smile,</p>
         <p>She ne'er allow'd of a pretence</p>
         <p>Beyond the claim of Innocence.</p>
         <p>There is a proverb so well known</p>
         <p>It would be ign'rance not to own</p>
         <p>The having heard and felt its truth</p>
         <p>E'en in the days of early youth,</p>
         <p>That, if we chance with those to live</p>
         <p>Whose lives a bad example give,</p>
         <p>They will convey, as we shall find,</p>
         <p>A foul contagion to the mind.</p>
         <p>Thus for a time _Ezekiel_ stood</p>
         <p>Firm as the tree that crowns the wood,</p>
         <p>But, after mocking ev'ry blast,</p>
         <p>Will sometimes bend and fall at last.</p>
         <p>Though whether he began to shake,</p>
         <p>Or only suffer'd twigs to break,</p>
         <p>But still retain'd his fibres bound, }</p>
         <p>In firm defiance to the ground, }</p>
         <p>While the main trunk, tho' shook, was sound, }</p>
         <p>Is what the curious mind shall know,</p>
         <p>And no far distant page will show.</p>
         <p>Thus the humble verse will trace</p>
         <p>His future honour or disgrace;</p>
         <p>As intermingled they must be</p>
         <p>With scenes of household history.</p>
         <p>When good _Sir Jeff'ry's_ gout was kind</p>
         <p>And to his bed he was confin'd;</p>
         <p>No dainty dinner to be got,</p>
         <p>And nought but messes in the pot,</p>
         <p>The kitchen folk, then quite at leisure,</p>
         <p>Would think of more than common pleasure;</p>
         <p>Then butlers of the higher station,</p>
         <p>And valets to gay men of fashion,</p>
         <p>Invited were, to join the ball</p>
         <p>Now given in the servants' hall,</p>
         <p>With ladies' maids who titles bore</p>
         <p>Of mistresses--whose gowns they wore;</p>
         <p>And sometimes a smart tradesman, too,</p>
         <p>Would pop in to say--_how do ye do_.</p>
         <p>--Here all home secrets were betray'd-- }</p>
         <p>The various tricks which servants play'd, }</p>
         <p>And how their fortunes could be made. }</p>
         <p>When one grave man his silence broke,</p>
         <p>And thus to our _Ezekiel_ spoke:--</p>
         <p>"Had I," says he, "so fine a place,</p>
         <p>As your superior manners grace;</p>
         <p>Had I a rich man in my keeping,</p>
         <p>Who passes half his time in sleeping;</p>
         <p>Whose purse is always in your view,</p>
         <p>And lets you pay his tradesmen too;</p>
         <p>While, that he may enjoy his ease,</p>
         <p>He makes you guardian of his keys,</p>
         <p>My growing fortune soon should flow,</p>
         <p>And in a way he ne'er should know.</p>
         <p>If by his bed you are his nurse,</p>
         <p>And have the jingling of his purse;</p>
         <p>If, when the doctor comes to see him,</p>
         <p>And you are calmly told to fee him,</p>
         <p>You must be nam'd the veriest elf</p>
         <p>If, then, you do not fee yourself:</p>
         <p>Nay, when his fingers, cramp'd with gout,</p>
         <p>Cannot well take a _sovereign_ out,</p>
         <p>And he should bid you take out four,</p>
         <p>Contrive to grapple five or more.</p>
         <p>'Tis when he's sick with aches and ails,</p>
         <p>When pain torments and mem'ry fails,</p>
         <p>When the night's pass'd his bed beside,</p>
         <p>Then Fortune tells you to provide</p>
         <p>For future wants,--and bless the hour</p>
         <p>That gives the means into your power:</p>
         <p>Nor ever fail, on some pretence,</p>
         <p>To rail against the rash expense</p>
         <p>Which doctors and their varlets bring</p>
         <p>To patients, sick and suffering,</p>
         <p>Till you can get him to exclaim--</p>
         <p>'Expense is a mere idle name;</p>
         <p>Of cost let your complainings cease,</p>
         <p>I care not so it gives me ease:'</p>
         <p>Then offer up your thanks to Heaven</p>
         <p>That to his fortune it is given</p>
         <p>To be thus blest with ample wealth,</p>
         <p>At any cost to purchase health.</p>
         <p>This is your harvest; I shall tell</p>
         <p>Another story when he's well:</p>
         <p>That time's but short,--though let him see</p>
         <p>That then you're all economy.</p>
         <p>When he can settle an account,</p>
         <p>And look into the just amount,</p>
         <p>Then, then let ev'ry thing appear</p>
         <p>Just as it ought--correct and clear.</p>
         <p>Thus let your speculations rove</p>
         <p>When well below, when sick above,</p>
         <p>And all I'm worth I now would stake</p>
         <p>You will, in time, a fortune make.</p>
         <p>Rich as he is, and careless too,</p>
         <p>With such a confidence in you,</p>
         <p>_Sir Jeffery_ will never feel</p>
         <p>Your happy turn in fortune's wheel."</p>
         <p>"Hold, hold awhile," the list'ner said,</p>
         <p>"This is too much," and shook his head;</p>
         <p>"For still I feel, without offence,</p>
         <p>I've not quite done with Conscience,</p>
         <p>Nor can so boldly lay aside</p>
         <p>The warnings of that faithful guide!</p>
         <p>Am I this moment to forget</p>
         <p>How much I'm in _Sir Jeff'ry's_ debt,</p>
         <p>And thus, with chance of foul disgrace,</p>
         <p>To play the rogue and risque my place?"</p>
         <p>"No, no," his counsellor replied,</p>
         <p>"Servants and masters are allied;</p>
         <p>Each is to each a foster-brother,</p>
         <p>And have their claims on one another.</p>
         <p>An useful servant is a treasure,</p>
         <p>Whose service masters seldom measure.</p>
         <p>What I now from my heart commend,</p>
         <p>As an experienc'd, willing friend,</p>
         <p>Is not to rob or place your paw</p>
         <p>On what is guarded by the law,</p>
         <p>But such as are no more than fees</p>
         <p>For all your extra services;</p>
         <p>For duties which no pay engages,</p>
         <p>Under the common name of wages;</p>
         <p>For what your varied service grants</p>
         <p>To all his fancied, sickly wants,</p>
         <p>Which never can your toil requite</p>
         <p>For all you do by day or night.</p>
         <p>"When _Sir Jeffery_ fortune gain'd,</p>
         <p>By contracts from the State obtain'd,</p>
         <p>Think you he had a pious loathing</p>
         <p>To crib a yard from soldiers' clothing?</p>
         <p>And when he did his thousands touch,</p>
         <p>To say--'my lord, I've got too much;</p>
         <p>And I am ready to confess</p>
         <p>I should have done the job for less.'</p>
         <p>How could such men their fortunes make</p>
         <p>Did they but fair advantage take!</p>
         <p>And have you not an equal claim,</p>
         <p>In a small way, to do the same?</p>
         <p>--When the Knight took his daily range</p>
         <p>From _Mincing Lane_ to the _Exchange_,</p>
         <p>And calculated as he went,</p>
         <p>How he should make his _Cent. per Cent._</p>
         <p>Think you that he was over-nice</p>
         <p>To fix his rate of merchandise?</p>
         <p>When his ships sought some foreign strand,</p>
         <p>Did he disdain the contraband,</p>
         <p>If he could but with safety chouse</p>
         <p>The sentries of the custom-house?</p>
         <p>A little smuggling all allow,</p>
         <p>But only mind the when and how:</p>
         <p>Take your _per centage_, but with care;</p>
         <p>And who will say it is not fair?</p>
         <p>--I've serv'd the wealthy and the great,</p>
         <p>Nay once a Minister of state,</p>
         <p>And as I saw that in his station</p>
         <p>He did not fail to rob the nation,</p>
         <p>I thought I might indulge the whim,</p>
         <p>As a turn serv'd, to pilfer him.</p>
         <p>I courted too my Lady's maid,</p>
         <p>For Charlotte understood her trade:</p>
         <p>I form'd my plan and did espouse her,</p>
         <p>Then started up a tonish grocer,</p>
         <p>Kept butlers in my constant pay</p>
         <p>Who serve me in the usual way,</p>
         <p>And all the house-keepers around</p>
         <p>With certain something in the pound.</p>
         <p>Now hear the advantage which I share</p>
         <p>From all my caution, all my care!</p>
         <p>I have a genteel, pleasant home,</p>
         <p>To ladies let my drawing-room,</p>
         <p>And in a whisky I can ride</p>
         <p>With Charlotte smiling by my side.</p>
         <p>'Tis thus I offer to your view,</p>
         <p>What I have done,--for you to do."</p>
         <p>Here this fine conversation ended,</p>
         <p>But not, perhaps, as was intended,</p>
         <p>Which strong temptations might display</p>
         <p>To lead th' unsettled mind astray;</p>
         <p>And, for a time, as fancy play'd,</p>
         <p>Now beaming light, now seeking shade,</p>
         <p>_Ezekiel_ hover'd o'er the plan</p>
         <p>Of specious rogue or honest man.</p>
         <p>Perhaps a smart, neat, pleasant shop,</p>
         <p>Did on his pericranium pop,</p>
         <p>With his warm, faithful wish to crown,</p>
         <p>The lovely Molly then his own:</p>
         <p>Such interests might his purpose guide,</p>
         <p>Till he was questioned by his pride;--</p>
         <p>"--But can this be a proper plan</p>
         <p>For one bred like a gentleman?</p>
         <p>'Tis true I cannot change the show }</p>
         <p>Of kitchen policy below, }</p>
         <p>There I must yield, I'm bound to know: }</p>
         <p>But, in the regions above,</p>
         <p>The whole in rectitude shall move;</p>
         <p>To the Knight's goodness I may trust,</p>
         <p>And faithful will I be and just;</p>
         <p>Nor ever take or e'en receive</p>
         <p>But what his favour's pleas'd to give;</p>
         <p>Nor shall reproach my mind disgrace</p>
         <p>Whene'er I look him in the face."</p>
         <p>Such were his thoughts,--the grocer fail'd.</p>
         <p>Thus honesty at length prevail'd,</p>
         <p>And sav'd him, as things shortly stood,</p>
         <p>From baseness of ingratitude.</p>
         <p>In a few days the parting gout</p>
         <p>Gave the Knight leave to go about,</p>
         <p>And one day in his arm-chair plac'd,</p>
         <p>The table with its luncheon grac'd,</p>
         <p>Smiling, as he luxurious sat,</p>
         <p>He thus let loose his easy chat.</p>
         <p>"This soup, my friend's a special treat,</p>
         <p>Fit for an Emperor to eat,</p>
         <p>And now, my pleasure to pursue,</p>
         <p>I trust I have a treat for you.</p>
         <p>I've spar'd no pains to know the fate</p>
         <p>That on your future hopes may wait,</p>
         <p>And what I shall proceed to tell</p>
         <p>May altogether please you well,</p>
         <p>Unless you are resolv'd to try</p>
         <p>New whims and tricks of foolery,</p>
         <p>On which, however will depend,</p>
         <p>Whether your master is your friend.</p>
         <p>If, at all points, the news I bring</p>
         <p>May not be quite so flattering;</p>
         <p>Yet surely it deserves at least,</p>
         <p>To be thought good, if not the best.</p>
         <p>--You need no longer stand in awe</p>
         <p>Of any terrors of the law,</p>
         <p>The beating you to _Gripe-all_ gave</p>
         <p>Did little harm to that same knave,</p>
         <p>For he surviv'd to play a prank,</p>
         <p>By robbing of a country bank,</p>
         <p>And fled, as his late neighbours say,</p>
         <p>To flourish in America.</p>
         <p>Thither your fortune too is gone,</p>
         <p>But then your fears are also flown.</p>
         <p>Time, it is hop'd may make amends,</p>
         <p>Fortune and you may still be friends;</p>
         <p>Nor shall I my best wishes smother</p>
         <p>To introduce you to each other.</p>
         <p>My growing favour you will see,</p>
         <p>So lay aside your livery:</p>
         <p>Hence you will need not a disguise</p>
         <p>'Gainst curious thoughts and prying eyes:</p>
         <p>Your former title you may claim,</p>
         <p>Again QUÆ GENUS is your name:</p>
         <p>Be faithful, and you soon shall know</p>
         <p>The kindness I may yet bestow.</p>
         <p>Nay, be but honest, while I live }</p>
         <p>Your upright service shall receive }</p>
         <p>All that my grateful hand should give: }</p>
         <p>Nor doubt my purpose as sincere,--</p>
         <p>More may be meant than meets the ear."</p>
         <p>What heart, with the least sense of good,</p>
         <p>That would not melt with gratitude,</p>
         <p>When such a gen'rous friend was near</p>
         <p>The clouded scenes of life to cheer,</p>
         <p>And bid the drooping hopes pursue</p>
         <p>A brighter prospect now in view!</p>
         <p>And where's the heart that would not feel,</p>
         <p>And where's the tongue that could conceal</p>
         <p>The sense that virtue had withstood</p>
         <p>Such specious efforts to delude!</p>
         <p>QUÆ GENUS the sensation felt</p>
         <p>That bade repenting thoughts to melt;</p>
         <p>Nay, he e'en cast his eyes to Heaven,</p>
         <p>With doubts that he should be forgiven</p>
         <p>For having listen'd to deceit</p>
         <p>And almost yielded to the cheat,</p>
         <p>Whose principles had he obey'd</p>
         <p>As in the grocer's scheme display'd,</p>
         <p>All trembling he should now have stood</p>
         <p>A monster of ingratitude.</p>
         <p>What he had 'scap'd his heart confess'd,</p>
         <p>And his moist eyes confirm'd the rest.</p>
         <p>With ev'ry grateful feeling fraught</p>
         <p>He spoke not, but 'twas thus he thought:--</p>
         <p>"My ever-watchful care shall tend</p>
         <p>To make me worthy such a friend,</p>
         <p>And all my kindred virtues burn</p>
         <p>To make that friend a due return."</p>
         <p>The Knight, with kindness, view'd the feeling,</p>
         <p>Which poor QUÆ GENUS was revealing;</p>
         <p>When, to cut short the pleasing pain</p>
         <p>Which words were failing to explain,</p>
         <p>He smiling bade him take his way</p>
         <p>To the known duties of the day.</p>
         <p>Of words there was a mute hiatus,</p>
         <p>And of the noon-tide apparatus</p>
         <p>The table quickly was bereft,</p>
         <p>While with some new-born pamphlet left,</p>
         <p>_Sir Jeffery_ calmly was proceeding</p>
         <p>To gratify his usual reading,</p>
         <p>When our QUÆ GENUS bore away</p>
         <p>The fragments of the lighten'd tray,</p>
         <p>And sought his pantry's cool retreat,</p>
         <p>Where, lolling on a welcome seat,</p>
         <p>He let his busy fancy range</p>
         <p>Throughout the unexpected change,</p>
         <p>That did upon his fortune wait;</p>
         <p>And still, though humble was his state,</p>
         <p>Scarce could he think it a disaster</p>
         <p>To wait the will of such a master;</p>
         <p>Nor did his pride reluctant bend,</p>
         <p>Since that same master was his friend.</p>
         <p>All that indulgence could bestow</p>
         <p>_Sir Jeff'ry_ did not fail to show;</p>
         <p>And, when alone, it seem'd to please</p>
         <p>The knight to set him at his ease,</p>
         <p>And shrink the distance to a span</p>
         <p>Between the master and the man.</p>
         <p>--Nay, here it cannot be denied }</p>
         <p>That it was soothing to his pride }</p>
         <p>To lay the shoulder-knot aside. }</p>
         <p>The liv'ried dress of red and brown</p>
         <p>He thus was call'd on to disown:</p>
         <p>In blue and buff, or buff and blue</p>
         <p>He now appear'd to daily view.</p>
         <p>The knight allow'd the taylor's art</p>
         <p>By all its power to make him smart;</p>
         <p>And Snip with his consummate skill,</p>
         <p>In working drapery to his will,</p>
         <p>By his contrivance gave the cape</p>
         <p>A flow to soften down the shape,</p>
         <p>So that the hump could scarce be said</p>
         <p>His general figure to degrade,</p>
         <p>Nor, to a common view, be seen</p>
         <p>To indispose his pleasing mien.</p>
         <p>Thus did he sit and calmly bless</p>
         <p id="ca4">The hopes of promis'd happiness.</p>
         <p>CANTO IV</p>
         <p>The various, the uncertain views</p>
         <p>Which the all-anxious world pursues,</p>
         <p>While it directs its searching eye</p>
         <p>To what is call'd prosperity,</p>
         <p>Compose the gen'ral, pictur'd strife</p>
         <p>That forms the daily scene of life;</p>
         <p>And make up the uncertain measure</p>
         <p>Of power, of riches, and of pleasure;</p>
         <p>Which, whatsoe'er may be our state, }</p>
         <p>Do on the varying projects wait }</p>
         <p>Of lowly poor or princely great: }</p>
         <p>For as all worldly things move on</p>
         <p>We weigh them by comparison.</p>
         <p>Thus he who boasts his little all</p>
         <p>At a street-corner on a stall,</p>
         <p>Tempting the gaze of wandering eyes</p>
         <p>To view the transient merchandise,</p>
         <p>Will look to Fortune's smile to bless</p>
         <p>His humble trading with success,</p>
         <p>As he whose freighted vessel sails</p>
         <p>O'er distant seas with doubtful gales.</p>
         <p>Nay, in Ambition's humble school</p>
         <p>Perceive we not the love of rule,</p>
         <p>O'er rustic swains to bear the rod</p>
         <p>And be a village demi-god?</p>
         <p>To gain command and take the lead</p>
         <p>Where mean submission courts a head,</p>
         <p>Does in the lowest class prevail</p>
         <p>Of vulgar thoughts to turn the scale,</p>
         <p>As that which on their wishes wait,</p>
         <p>Whose object is to rule the state.</p>
         <p>--Seek you for pleasure as it flows,</p>
         <p>In ev'ry soil the flow'ret grows;</p>
         <p>From the pale primrose of the dale</p>
         <p>Nurs'd only by the vernal gale,</p>
         <p>To the rich plant of sweets so rare }</p>
         <p>Whose tints the rainbow colours share }</p>
         <p>And drinks conservatorial air. }</p>
         <p>But, 'tis so subject to the blast,</p>
         <p>It cannot promise long to last;</p>
         <p>Though still it 'joys the fragrant day,</p>
         <p>Till nature bids it pass away.</p>
         <p>The rude boy turns the circling rope,</p>
         <p>Or flies a kite or spins a top,</p>
         <p>When, a stout stripling, he is seen</p>
         <p>With bat and ball upon the green;</p>
         <p>The later pleasures then await</p>
         <p>On humble life whate'er its state,</p>
         <p>And are with equal ardor sought</p>
         <p>As those with high refinement wrought,</p>
         <p>Where birth and wealth and taste combine</p>
         <p>To make the festive brilliance shine.</p>
         <p>Thus the same passions govern all</p>
         <p>Who creep on this terrestrial ball:</p>
         <p>Their objects, truly, are the same,</p>
         <p>However shap'd, whate'er their name.</p>
         <p>What though the varying plan confounds</p>
         <p>In giving sixpences or pounds,</p>
         <p>In velvet or in home-spun cloth,</p>
         <p>They may be base curmudgeons both.</p>
         <p>Some are by charity enroll'd</p>
         <p>On tablets proud in lines of gold,</p>
         <p>While others, as by stealth, convey</p>
         <p>The mite that shuns the light of day;</p>
         <p>Though each performs a diff'rent part,</p>
         <p>Each may possess a Christian heart.</p>
         <p>It is not upon wealth alone</p>
         <p>That happiness erects its throne:</p>
         <p>How oft, alas! it is we see</p>
         <p>The rich involv'd in misery;</p>
         <p>How oft is view'd in reason's eye</p>
         <p>The wants which wealth can ne'er supply!</p>
         <p>The way to power may be betray'd,</p>
         <p>Though 'tis with solid gold inlaid;</p>
         <p>Nay, purchas'd pleasure prove deceit,</p>
         <p>And be at length a very cheat.</p>
         <p>--How weak, how vain is human pride,</p>
         <p>Dares man upon himself confide:</p>
         <p>The wretch who glories in his gain</p>
         <p>Amasses heaps on heaps in vain.</p>
         <p>Why lose we life, in anxious cares,</p>
         <p>To lay in hoards for future years?</p>
         <p>Can they, when tortur'd by disease,</p>
         <p>Cheer our sick heart and purchase ease?</p>
         <p>Can they prolong one gasp of breath,</p>
         <p>Or calm the troubled hour of death?</p>
         <p>What's man in all his boasted sway?</p>
         <p>Perhaps the tyrant of a day.</p>
         <p>Can he in all the pride of power</p>
         <p>Ensure his honours for an hour?</p>
         <p>Alike the laws of life take place</p>
         <p>Through ev'ry branch of human race:</p>
         <p>The monarch, of long regal line,</p>
         <p>Was rais'd from dust as frail as mine.</p>
         <p>Can he pour health into his veins</p>
         <p>Or cool the fever's restless pains?</p>
         <p>Can he worn down in nature's course</p>
         <p>New brace his feebled nerves with force?</p>
         <p>Can he, how vain is mortal power,</p>
         <p>Stretch life beyond the destin'd hour?</p>
         <p>"Consider, man, weigh well thy frame;</p>
         <p>The king, the beggar, is the same,</p>
         <p>Dust form'd us all,--each breathes his day, }</p>
         <p>Then sinks into his mortal clay." }</p>
         <p>Thus wrote the fabling Muse of GAY. }</p>
         <p>Such thoughts as these of moral kind</p>
         <p>QUÆ GENUS weigh'd within his mind:</p>
         <p>For wherefore should it not be thought }</p>
         <p>That, as his early mind was taught, }</p>
         <p>It might be with sage maxims fraught? }</p>
         <p>--Thus seated, or as he stood sentry,</p>
         <p>Sole guardian of the butler's pantry,</p>
         <p>Which lock'd up all the household state,</p>
         <p>The cumbrance rich of massy plate,</p>
         <p>And all the honour that could grace</p>
         <p>The power of superior place,</p>
         <p>That did acknowledg'd rank bestow</p>
         <p>O'er all the kitchen-folk below;</p>
         <p>What wonder that his mind should range</p>
         <p>On hopes that waited on the change</p>
         <p>Which unexpected Fortune's power</p>
         <p>Seem'd on his present state to shower.</p>
         <p>Though while his wand'ring mind embrac'd</p>
         <p>The present time as well as past,</p>
         <p>The visions of the future too</p>
         <p>Gave a fair prospect to his view.</p>
         <p>But life this well-known feature bears,</p>
         <p>Our _hopes_' associates are our _fears_,</p>
         <p>And ever seem, in reason's eye,</p>
         <p>As struggling for the mastery,</p>
         <p>In which they play their various part,</p>
         <p>To gain that citadel the heart.</p>
         <p>Thus though our Hero's honest pride</p>
         <p>Was, for the present, satisfied;</p>
         <p>And did things, as they seem'd to show,</p>
         <p>Promise to stay in _Statu Quo_,</p>
         <p>He, surely, would have ask'd no more</p>
         <p>For Fortune on his lot to pour,</p>
         <p>And with all due contentment wait</p>
         <p>For what might be his future fate:</p>
         <p>But while the present hour beguiles</p>
         <p>His cheerful mind with cheering smiles,</p>
         <p>The forward thought would strive to sow</p>
         <p>An awkward wrinkle on his brow.</p>
         <p>Now, strange as the event appears,</p>
         <p>The source of all his hopes and fears</p>
         <p>Was on each settled point the same,</p>
         <p>And _Jeff'ry Gourmand_ was its name.</p>
         <p>The Knight most gen'rous was and free,</p>
         <p>And kind as kindest heart could be,</p>
         <p>So that QUÆ GENUS scarce could trace</p>
         <p>The humbling duties of his place.</p>
         <p>Whate'er he did was sure to please,</p>
         <p>No fretful whims appear'd to tease;</p>
         <p>And while with fond attention shown,</p>
         <p>He did each willing duty own,</p>
         <p>Sir _Jeff'ry_ frequent smiles bestow'd,</p>
         <p>And many a kind indulgence show'd,</p>
         <p>And oftentimes would wants repress</p>
         <p>To make his fav'rite's labours less:</p>
         <p>Nay, when he dawdled o'er his meat, }</p>
         <p>Would nod and bid him take a seat }</p>
         <p>To share the lux'ry of the treat. }</p>
         <p>--He fancied, and it might be true,</p>
         <p>That none about him e'er could do</p>
         <p>What his peculiar wants required,</p>
         <p>And in the way he most desired,</p>
         <p>As _his_ QUÆ GENUS, thus he claim'd him,</p>
         <p>Whene'er to other folk he nam'd him.</p>
         <p>Indeed, he took it in his head</p>
         <p>That no one else could warm his bed,</p>
         <p>And give it that proportion'd heat</p>
         <p>That gave due warmth to either sheet.</p>
         <p>Our Hero rather lik'd the plan,</p>
         <p>As Molly brought the warming-pan,</p>
         <p>And having pass'd it through the door,</p>
         <p>Waited without till all was o'er.</p>
         <p>Thus, having rang'd the alarum-bell,</p>
         <p>With other things I must not tell,</p>
         <p>And seen Sir _Jeff'ry's_ pillow'd head</p>
         <p>Turning to rest within his bed,</p>
         <p>QUÆ GENUS bore the pan away</p>
         <p>Where Molly fair was us'd to stay.</p>
         <p>He was to honour firm, and she</p>
         <p>The mirror bright of Chastity.</p>
         <p>Thus half an hour was often spent</p>
         <p>In interchange of sentiment,</p>
         <p>Which doubtless was some tender theme:</p>
         <p>A subject for a pleasing dream.</p>
         <p>All this tells well,--nor was this all;</p>
         <p>The sceptre of the servants'-hall</p>
         <p>Was now committed to his hand;</p>
         <p>O'er that he had supreme command,</p>
         <p>But such his mild and smiling sway,</p>
         <p>All felt a pleasure to obey;</p>
         <p>And 'twas the kitchen's daily toast,</p>
         <p>Long may QUÆ GENUS rule the roast.</p>
         <p>Tradesmen did to his worth subscribe,</p>
         <p>For bills were paid without a bribe;</p>
         <p>And good Sir _Jeffery_ quite content</p>
         <p>How the allotted income went,</p>
         <p>At no accounts e'er gave a look,</p>
         <p>But those which fill'd his Banker's book.</p>
         <p>What could our Hero more desire,</p>
         <p>What more his anxious wish require,</p>
         <p>When with a calm and reas'ning eye</p>
         <p>He ponder'd o'er his destiny,</p>
         <p>As he unwound the tangled thread</p>
         <p>That to his present comforts led,</p>
         <p>And serv'd as a directing clue</p>
         <p>In such strange ways to guide him through?</p>
         <p>--To what new heights his hopes might soar,</p>
         <p>It would be needless to explore:</p>
         <p>For now the threat'ning time appears</p>
         <p>When he is troubled with his fears.</p>
         <p>His hopes have triumph'd o'er the past;</p>
         <p>But then the present may not last;</p>
         <p>And what succession he might find</p>
         <p>Harass'd with doubts his anxious mind.</p>
         <p>--Of the gross, cumbrous flesh the load</p>
         <p>Sir _Jeffery_ bore did not forebode</p>
         <p>Through future years a ling'ring strife</p>
         <p>Between the powers of death and life;</p>
         <p>The legs puff'd out with frequent swell,</p>
         <p>Did symptoms of the dropsy tell;</p>
         <p>The stiffen'd joints no one could doubt</p>
         <p>Were children of a settled gout;</p>
         <p>And humours redd'ning on the face,</p>
         <p>Bespoke the Erysipelas.</p>
         <p>Indeed, whene'er QUÆ GENUS view'd,</p>
         <p>With rich and poignant sauce embued,</p>
         <p>As dish to dish did there succeed,</p>
         <p>Which seem'd by Death compos'd to feed</p>
         <p>With fatal relishes to please</p>
         <p>The curious taste of each disease,</p>
         <p>That did Sir _Jeffery's_ carcase share</p>
         <p>And riot on the destin'd fare:</p>
         <p>When thus he watch'd th' insidious food,</p>
         <p>He fear'd the ground on which he stood.</p>
         <p>--Oft did he curse the weighty haunch</p>
         <p>Which might o'ercharge Sir _Jeff'ry's_ paunch;</p>
         <p>And to the turtle give a kick,</p>
         <p>Whose callipash might make him sick.</p>
         <p>He only pray'd Sir _Jeff'ry's_ wealth</p>
         <p>Might keep on life and purchase health.</p>
         <p>"Let him but live," he would exclaim,</p>
         <p>"And fortune I will never blame."</p>
         <p>Money is oft employ'd in vain,</p>
         <p>To cure disease and stifle pain;</p>
         <p>And though he hop'd yet still he fear'd</p>
         <p>Whene'er grave Galen's self appear'd;</p>
         <p>For when the solemn Doctor came,</p>
         <p>(Sir MIDRIFF BOLUS was his name,)</p>
         <p>He often in a whisper said,</p>
         <p>"I wonder that he is not dead,</p>
         <p>Nay, I must own, 'tis most surprising,</p>
         <p>That such a length of gormandising</p>
         <p>Has not ere this produc'd a treat</p>
         <p>For hungry church-yard worms to eat,</p>
         <p>And 'tis the skill by which I thrive</p>
         <p>That keeps him to this hour alive.</p>
         <p>Nay, though I now Sir _Jeffery_ see }</p>
         <p>In spirits and such smiling glee, }</p>
         <p>I tremble for to-morrow's fee." }</p>
         <p>--When this brief tale he chose to tell</p>
         <p>And ring his patient's fun'ral bell,</p>
         <p>QUÆ GENUS fail'd not to exclaim,</p>
         <p>As he call'd on the Doctor's name,</p>
         <p>"O tell me not of the disaster</p>
         <p>That I must feel for such a master,</p>
         <p>Nay, I may add, for such a friend</p>
         <p>Were I to go to the world's end,</p>
         <p>Alas, my journey would be vain,</p>
         <p>Another such I ne'er should gain!"</p>
         <p>Sir MIDRIFF, member of the college,</p>
         <p>And of high standing for his knowledge,</p>
         <p>In lab'ring physic's mystic sense</p>
         <p>And practical experience,</p>
         <p>As common fame was pleas'd to say,</p>
         <p>Expected more than common pay.</p>
         <p>Now, as Sir _Jeff'ry_ never thought</p>
         <p>His health could be too dearly bought,</p>
         <p>Whene'er the healing Knight was seen,</p>
         <p>Wrapt up within the Indian screen,</p>
         <p>To shape the drugs that might becalm</p>
         <p>Some secret pain or sudden qualm;</p>
         <p>Or when there was a frequent question,</p>
         <p>Of bile's o'erflow and indigestion,</p>
         <p>Or some more serious want had sped</p>
         <p>Sir _Jeff'ry Gourmand_ to his bed,</p>
         <p>QUÆ GENUS fail'd not to convey</p>
         <p>(For he had learn'd the ready way),</p>
         <p>The two-fold fee, by strict command,</p>
         <p>Into Sir _Midriff's_ ready hand.</p>
         <p>Thus, in this kind of double dealing,</p>
         <p>The Doctor had a pleasant feeling,</p>
         <p>That seem'd to work up a regard</p>
         <p>For him who gave the due reward,</p>
         <p>And knew so well to shape the fee</p>
         <p>From the sick chamber's treasury.</p>
         <p>Thus when our Hero told his pain }</p>
         <p>And did his future fears explain, }</p>
         <p>_Galen_ replied,--"Those fears restrain, }</p>
         <p>To this grave promise pray attend,</p>
         <p>Sir _Midriff Bolus_ is your friend."</p>
         <p>Such, when he touch'd the welcome fees,</p>
         <p>Were the sly Doctor's promises:</p>
         <p>QUÆ GENUS with good grace receiv'd 'em,</p>
         <p>Though 'tis not said that he believ'd 'em.</p>
         <p>--No, never was a visit past,</p>
         <p>But it was hinted as the last,</p>
         <p>Had they not been in lucky trim</p>
         <p>To have sent off post-haste for him.</p>
         <p>Whene'er the Knight's legs took to swelling,</p>
         <p>All ears were bor'd with sad foretelling;</p>
         <p>And if his chest was over-loaded,</p>
         <p>Some dire disaster was foreboded,</p>
         <p>But failing in prophetic story,</p>
         <p>He gave his science all the glory.</p>
         <p>A year, howe'er, was past and gone,</p>
         <p>And all the household cares went on,</p>
         <p>In active zeal and order too,</p>
         <p>As all such matters ought to do,</p>
         <p>With hours of leisure well employ'd,</p>
         <p>And many a fantasy enjoy'd.</p>
         <p>But something yet remains to know:--</p>
         <p>To manage _two strings to your bow_,</p>
         <p>A maxim is, which ev'ry age</p>
         <p>Has rend'red venerably sage,</p>
         <p>And forms a more than useful rule</p>
         <p>In the world's universal school.</p>
         <p>Sir _Jeffery_, we make no doubt,</p>
         <p>In various ways had found it out:</p>
         <p>It might have help'd him on to wealth,</p>
         <p>And now to aid the wants of health,</p>
         <p>He kept the adage in his view, }</p>
         <p>And as one Doctor might not do, }</p>
         <p>It now appears that he had two. }</p>
         <p>The one, in order due, has been</p>
         <p>Brought forth on the dramatic scene,</p>
         <p>Ranks high in bright collegiate fame,</p>
         <p>And M. D. decorates his name.</p>
         <p>He never ventures to prescribe</p>
         <p>But what is known to all the tribe,</p>
         <p>Who hold the dispensarial reign</p>
         <p>Beneath the dome of Warwick-Lane.</p>
         <p>The other, steering from the track</p>
         <p>Of learned lore, was styl'd a Quack;</p>
         <p>Who, by a secret skill, composes</p>
         <p>For many an ill his sovereign doses:</p>
         <p>But whether right or wrong, the town</p>
         <p>Had given his nostrums some renown.</p>
         <p>Salves for all wounds, for each disease</p>
         <p>Specifics that could give it ease,</p>
         <p>Balsams, beyond all human praise,</p>
         <p>That would prolong our mortal days.</p>
         <p>All these, in many a puffing paper,</p>
         <p>Are seen in striking forms to vapour,</p>
         <p>As, in the Magazines they shine,</p>
         <p>The boast of Doctor ANODYNE.</p>
         <p>His office was advice to give</p>
         <p>In his own house from morn till eve,</p>
         <p>And a green door, within a court,</p>
         <p>Mark'd out the place of snug resort,</p>
         <p>Where patients could indulge the feeling</p>
         <p>That might dispose them to concealing</p>
         <p>The nervous hope, the sly desire</p>
         <p>To eke out life's expiring fire,</p>
         <p>Without the danger to expose</p>
         <p>Their secret or to friends or foes.</p>
         <p>Sir _Jeffery_ was one of these</p>
         <p>Who thought it was no waste of fees,</p>
         <p>Though they were toss'd about by stealth,</p>
         <p>If he could think they purchas'd health:</p>
         <p>But here, who will not say, it seems</p>
         <p>He guarded life by two extremes.</p>
         <p>Sir _Midriff_ told him he must starve,</p>
         <p>And _Anodyne_ to cut and carve:</p>
         <p>But though the first he nobly paid,</p>
         <p>It was the latter he obey'd.</p>
         <p>Full often was his _Merc'ry_ sent</p>
         <p>To bring back med'cine and content;</p>
         <p>Permission, what he wish'd, to eat, }</p>
         <p>And physic to allay the heat }</p>
         <p>Brought on by a luxurious treat; }</p>
         <p>To give the stomach strength to bear it,</p>
         <p>With some enliv'ning dose to cheer it.</p>
         <p>But still our Hero's watchful eye</p>
         <p>Saw that this sensuality</p>
         <p>Was bringing matters to an end,</p>
         <p>That he too soon should lose his friend;</p>
         <p>And in what way he should supply</p>
         <p>The loss when that same friend should die,</p>
         <p>Did often o'er his senses creep</p>
         <p>When he should have been fast asleep.</p>
         <p>Sir _Midriff_ to his promise swore,</p>
         <p>And _Anodyne_ had promis'd more,</p>
         <p>Both had prescrib'd or more or less,</p>
         <p>A future vision of success:</p>
         <p>But time has still some steps to move,</p>
         <p>Before they their engagements prove;</p>
         <p>Ere our QUÆ GENUS we shall see</p>
         <p>In a new line of history.</p>
         <p>Sir _Jeffery_ now began to droop,</p>
         <p>Nor was he eager for his soup:</p>
         <p>He blunder'd on the wrong ragout, }</p>
         <p>Nor harangu'd o'er a fav'rite stew, }</p>
         <p>Scarce wild-duck from a widgeon knew. }</p>
         <p>No longer thought it an abuse,</p>
         <p>To see St. MICH: without a goose.</p>
         <p>Unless prepar'd with cordial strong,</p>
         <p>He hardly heard the jovial song,</p>
         <p>Or hearing, had not strength to move</p>
         <p>And strike the table to approve.</p>
         <p>Nay, sometimes his unsteady hand</p>
         <p>Could not the rubied glass command,</p>
         <p>But forc'd him slowly to divide</p>
         <p>The rosy bumper's flowing tide.</p>
         <p>Beside him oft QUÆ GENUS sat</p>
         <p>An hour, and not a word of chat;</p>
         <p>And when he was in sleepy taking</p>
         <p>The news would scarcely keep him waking.</p>
         <p>--It was a melancholy showing,</p>
         <p>But poor Sir _Jeffery_ was a-going.</p>
         <p>"Indulge his gormandising swallow,</p>
         <p>And apoplexy soon must follow,"</p>
         <p>Such did Sir _Midriff's_ sage foreknowledge</p>
         <p>Give as the doctrine of the College.</p>
         <p>"--Now, if you dare to keep him low,</p>
         <p>A dropsy gives the fatal blow.</p>
         <p>Remember, my good friend, I pray,</p>
         <p>What _Anodyne_ is pleas'd to say."</p>
         <p>When, in a kind of solemn croak,</p>
         <p>The Quack, with shaking noddle, spoke.</p>
         <p>Thus did the differing doctors fail,</p>
         <p>Nor could their varying skill prevail:</p>
         <p>They neither could set matters right,</p>
         <p>Or quicken a pall'd appetite.</p>
         <p>More weak and weak Sir _Jeffery_ grew,</p>
         <p>Nay, wasted to the daily view,</p>
         <p>And, as his faithful servant found,</p>
         <p>Between two stools he fell to ground.</p>
         <p>But still he smelt the sav'ry meat, }</p>
         <p>He sometimes still would eye the treat, }</p>
         <p>And praise the dish he could not eat. }</p>
         <p>One day, when in a sunshine hour,</p>
         <p>To pick a bit he felt the power,</p>
         <p>Just as he did his knife apply</p>
         <p>To give a slice of oyster-pie,</p>
         <p>Whether the effort was too great</p>
         <p>To bear the morsel to his plate;</p>
         <p>Or if, from any other cause,</p>
         <p>His nature made a gen'ral pause,</p>
         <p>He gave a groan, it was his last,</p>
         <p>And life and oyster-pies were past.</p>
         <p>Which of the Doctors did the deed,</p>
         <p>The one who starv'd or he who fed,</p>
         <p>Or whether Nature, nothing loth,</p>
         <p>Laugh'd at the counsels of them both,</p>
         <p>And, as they issued their commands,</p>
         <p>Her victim took from both their hands,</p>
         <p>I know not, but it seems to me,</p>
         <p>To be the work of all the three.</p>
         <p>Here it would be but idle folly</p>
         <p>To call on fruitless melancholy,</p>
         <p>To talk of blisters that in vain</p>
         <p>Were spread to bring back life again;</p>
         <p>Or all the lancet's power explore</p>
         <p>To wake the breath that breath'd no more;</p>
         <p>The stroke was struck, no human art</p>
         <p>Could now withdraw the fatal dart.</p>
         <p>Mutes marching on, in solemn pace,</p>
         <p>With gladden'd heart and sorrowing face,</p>
         <p>Who, clad in black attire, for pay</p>
         <p>Let out their sorrows by the day:</p>
         <p>The nodding plumes and 'scutcheon'd hearse</p>
         <p>Would make a pretty show in verse;</p>
         <p>But 'tis enough, Sir _Jeffery_ dead,</p>
         <p>That his remains, enshrin'd in lead,</p>
         <p>And, cloth'd in all their sad array,</p>
         <p>To mingle with their native clay,</p>
         <p>Were safe convey'd to that same bourne</p>
         <p>From whence no travellers return.</p>
         <p>--We must another track pursue, }</p>
         <p>Life's varying path we have in view,-- }</p>
         <p id="ca5">Our way QUÆ GENUS is with you! }</p>
         <p>CANTO V</p>
         <p>As our enlighten'd reason ranges</p>
         <p>O'er man and all his various changes,</p>
         <p>What sober thoughts the scenes supply,</p>
         <p>To hamper our philosophy;</p>
         <p>To make the expanding bosom swell</p>
         <p>With the fine things the tongue can tell!</p>
         <p>And it were well, that while we preach,</p>
         <p>We practice, what we're fain to teach.</p>
         <p>O, here might many a line be lent,</p>
         <p>To teach the mind to learn content,</p>
         <p>And with a manly spirit bear</p>
         <p>The stroke of disappointing care;</p>
         <p>Awake a just disdain to smile</p>
         <p>On muckworm fortune base and vile,</p>
         <p>Look on its threatnings to betray,</p>
         <p>As darksome clouds that pass away,</p>
         <p>And call on cheering hope to see</p>
         <p>Some future, kind reality.</p>
         <p>--All who Sir _Jeffery_ knew could tell</p>
         <p>Our Hero serv'd him passing well;</p>
         <p>Nay to the care which he bestow'd }</p>
         <p>The Knight a lengthen'd period ow'd, }</p>
         <p>And such the thanks he oft avow'd. }</p>
         <p>QUÆ GENUS never lost his views</p>
         <p>Of duty and its faithful dues;</p>
         <p>His honour no one could suspect,</p>
         <p>Nor did he mark with cold neglect</p>
         <p>Those services which intervene }</p>
         <p>In a sick chamber's sickly scene: }</p>
         <p>His duty thought no office mean, }</p>
         <p>And to Sir _Jeffery's_ closing sigh</p>
         <p>All, all was warm fidelity.</p>
         <p>Nay, thus the Knight would frequent own</p>
         <p>A grateful sense of service done;</p>
         <p>And oft, in words like these, he said,</p>
         <p>That duty shall be well repaid.</p>
         <p>"QUÆ GENUS, know me for your friend,</p>
         <p>I to your welfare shall attend;</p>
         <p>Your friend while I retain my breath,</p>
         <p>And when that's gone, your friend in death."</p>
         <p>That death he felt as a disaster,</p>
         <p>For, to speak truth, he lov'd his master,</p>
         <p>Nor did he doubt that a reward</p>
         <p>Would prove that master's firm regard.</p>
         <p>'Tis nature, in life's worst vexation,</p>
         <p>To look at least for consolation;</p>
         <p>And he, 'tis true, had turn'd his eye</p>
         <p>To a consoling legacy,</p>
         <p>That might, at least, make some amends,</p>
         <p>For losing this his best of friends;</p>
         <p>But his ill luck we must not smother;</p>
         <p>He lost the one, nor found the other.</p>
         <p>The will was full of good intent,</p>
         <p>And a warm legacy was meant</p>
         <p>To poor QUÆ GENUS, there's no doubt,</p>
         <p>But shuffling Fortune left it out;</p>
         <p>'Twas she cut short the kind bequest,</p>
         <p>Which was thus fatally express'd.</p>
         <p>"To this my last and solemn Will</p>
         <p>I add by way of Codicil,</p>
         <p>My true and faithful servant's name,</p>
         <p>Who to my care has every claim:</p>
         <p>--To JOHN QUÆ GENUS I bequeath</p>
         <p>One month posterior to my death,</p>
         <p>The sum of</p>
         <p>Here a blank ensued</p>
         <p>Which has not yet been understood,</p>
         <p>Or why the figures were delay'd</p>
         <p>That would a sterling gift have made.</p>
         <p>Whether a sudden twitch of gout</p>
         <p>Caus'd him to leave the figures out;</p>
         <p>Or visit of a chatt'ring friend</p>
         <p>That did th' important words suspend,</p>
         <p>And thus retard the kind design,</p>
         <p>Until the 'morrow's sun should shine,</p>
         <p>That 'morrow with its ha's and hums,</p>
         <p>Which, often promis'd, never comes:</p>
         <p>Howe'er the enquiring mind may guess</p>
         <p>It cannot find the wish'd success:</p>
         <p>In short, whatever cause prevail'd,</p>
         <p>Too true, the gen'rous purpose fail'd.</p>
         <p>In the Knight's mind the boon was will'd,</p>
         <p>But still the blank was never fill'd,</p>
         <p>And no more the said will engages</p>
         <p>Than mourning suit and one year's wages,</p>
         <p>Which all his household should inherit</p>
         <p>Whate'er their station or their merit:</p>
         <p>Here no distinction was display'd</p>
         <p>'Tween high and low, 'tween man and maid,</p>
         <p>And though QUÆ GENUS was the first,</p>
         <p>He had his portion with the worst.</p>
         <p>Our Hero thought it wond'rous hard</p>
         <p>Thus to be foil'd of his reward,</p>
         <p>That which, in ev'ry point of view,</p>
         <p>He felt to be his honest due;</p>
         <p>And both his master and his friend</p>
         <p>Did to his services intend;</p>
         <p>Which, as the sun at noontide clear,</p>
         <p>Does by the codicil appear:</p>
         <p>But when he ask'd Sir _Jeffery's_ heir }</p>
         <p>(Who did so large a fortune share) }</p>
         <p>The blank hiatus to repair, }</p>
         <p>Which he with truth could represent</p>
         <p>As an untoward accident,</p>
         <p>The wealthy merchant shook his head</p>
         <p>And bade him go and ask the dead.</p>
         <p>QUÆ GENUS ventur'd to reply</p>
         <p>While his breast heav'd a painful sigh,</p>
         <p>"The dead, you know, Sir, cannot speak,</p>
         <p>But could the grave its silence break,</p>
         <p>I humbly ask your gen'rous heart,</p>
         <p>Would not its language take my part,</p>
         <p>Would it not utter, 'O fulfil</p>
         <p>The purpose of the codicil?'</p>
         <p>Would it not tell you to supply</p>
         <p>The blank with a due legacy?"</p>
         <p>The rich man, turning on his heel,</p>
         <p>Did not the rising taunt conceal.</p>
         <p>"All that the grave may please to say,</p>
         <p>I promise, friend, I will obey."</p>
         <p>What could be done with this high Cit,</p>
         <p>But to look sad and to submit;</p>
         <p>For it could answer no good end</p>
         <p>Though indispos'd to be a friend,</p>
         <p>That kind of discontent to show</p>
         <p>Which might convert him to a foe.</p>
         <p>But ere we altogether leave</p>
         <p>Sir _Jeffery's_ grateful friends to grieve,</p>
         <p>We mean all those which to the sight</p>
         <p>Were clearly writ, in black and white,</p>
         <p>Within the bound'ries of the will,</p>
         <p>Nor left to _blundering Codicil_,</p>
         <p>It may not be amiss to draw</p>
         <p>The picture of the _Heir at Law_.</p>
         <p>When on the 'Change he took his rounds,</p>
         <p>He walk'd an hundred thousand pounds:</p>
         <p>Not less was his acknowledg'd worth</p>
         <p>When ev'ry morn he sallied forth,</p>
         <p>With expectation grave, to meet</p>
         <p>Fortune's fresh smiles in Lombard-Street.</p>
         <p>Upright in all his worldly dealing:--</p>
         <p>But that high sense of noble feeling,</p>
         <p>The humane impulse to relieve,</p>
         <p>To wipe the eye of those who grieve,</p>
         <p>The wish of goodness to impart</p>
         <p>The bounties of a gen'rous heart,</p>
         <p>These were not his; and though the scroll</p>
         <p>That may the charities enroll</p>
         <p>Of gilded pride, upon the wall</p>
         <p>In some conspicuous hospital,</p>
         <p>Might his known name and title bear,</p>
         <p>'Twas vanity that plac'd it there.</p>
         <p>But though, perhaps, a plum or more</p>
         <p>Was added to his former store,</p>
         <p>If, by sad chance, with haggard mien,</p>
         <p>An humble suppliant should be seen,</p>
         <p>A mother sick, a father dead,</p>
         <p>And children, left forlorn, unfed,</p>
         <p>His hand ne'er ventur'd on his purse</p>
         <p>To give relief, and, what was worse,</p>
         <p>He would alarm the wretches' fears</p>
         <p>With beadles fierce and overseers,</p>
         <p>Or talk of laws for vagrants made,</p>
         <p>Which call the scourge-man to their aid.</p>
         <p>Thus nought was look'd for at his hands,</p>
         <p>But justice strict to just demands:</p>
         <p>No smiling, generous overflow</p>
         <p>Of fair reward would he bestow;</p>
         <p>No bounty did his thoughts prepare</p>
         <p>For duty's overweening care;</p>
         <p>While service, by affection wrought,</p>
         <p>Was, in his reck'ning, set at nought.</p>
         <p>QUÆ GENUS gave in his account;</p>
         <p>Its justness own'd, the full amount</p>
         <p>Was duly paid, but I'll forgive</p>
         <p>The mind refusing to believe,</p>
         <p>That, when the rich man should discover</p>
         <p>That he had paid some nine-pence over,</p>
         <p>He did, without a look of shame,</p>
         <p>That pittance as a balance claim:</p>
         <p>It may appear full passing strange,</p>
         <p>But 'tis a fact, he took the change,</p>
         <p>And did the jingling half-pence greet,</p>
         <p>Like fish-women in open street.</p>
         <p>E'en the worn wardrobe of the Knight,</p>
         <p>Which is esteem'd the valet's right,</p>
         <p>The gen'ral heir-loom of his place,</p>
         <p>Was seiz'd by the curmudgeon base,</p>
         <p>And borne away, a paltry gain,</p>
         <p>To his own Store in Mincing-Lane:</p>
         <p>But when, among the other dues,</p>
         <p>Were order'd off the _Gouty Shoes_,</p>
         <p>QUÆ GENUS, with contempt inflam'd,</p>
         <p>Thus, in a hearty tone, exclaim'd,</p>
         <p>"Away, to the mean merchant bear 'em!</p>
         <p>Heaven grant he may be forc'd to wear 'em!"</p>
         <p>--Thus things went on;--then came the time,</p>
         <p>(The truth e'en shames my humble rhyme)</p>
         <p>When the Executor and Heir,</p>
         <p>For one did both the titles share,</p>
         <p>Appear'd to pay, in legal guise,</p>
         <p>The wages and the legacies.</p>
         <p>QUÆ GENUS, who had lately been</p>
         <p>A favour'd actor in the scene,</p>
         <p>Could not have guess'd at such disaster</p>
         <p>From such a friend and such a master:</p>
         <p>And though he strove, he scarce could hide</p>
         <p>The feelings of an honest pride,</p>
         <p>When, from Sir _Jeffery's_ error, he</p>
         <p>And those who wore a livery,</p>
         <p>Nay even house and kitchen-maid</p>
         <p>Were in the same proportions paid,--</p>
         <p>When his allotted mourning bore</p>
         <p>The same coarse stuff the coachman wore.</p>
         <p>But how his heart began to beat</p>
         <p>When he was charg'd for the _receipt_!</p>
         <p>All his distinction now was lost,</p>
         <p>And he who long had rul'd the roast,</p>
         <p>Had, since Sir _Jeffery_ went to rest,</p>
         <p>Been of his station dispossest;</p>
         <p>Nay, not a common smile remain'd</p>
         <p>Of all the favour he had gain'd,</p>
         <p>While beggarly mistrust took place,</p>
         <p>Which he must feel as foul disgrace:</p>
         <p>For ev'ry key had been demanded;</p>
         <p>One instant made him empty-handed</p>
         <p>Dismiss'd from his late envied station</p>
         <p>Without a nod of approbation,</p>
         <p>He was preparing to depart</p>
         <p>With downcast look and heavy heart;</p>
         <p>Nor could e'en Molly's tender smile</p>
         <p>Of one sad thought that heart beguile</p>
         <p>HIS FAREWELL SPEECH.</p>
         <p>"And now, I say, adieu, my friends,</p>
         <p>For here our fellow-service ends.</p>
         <p>You need not put on sorrowing faces;</p>
         <p>You will soon meet with ready places;</p>
         <p>'Tis me whose disappointing care,</p>
         <p>Of cheering prospects, bids despair.</p>
         <p>--You all, I'm sure can well believe,</p>
         <p>I have most ample cause to grieve</p>
         <p>That cruel Fortune thus should frown,</p>
         <p>When I thought her fond smiles my own.</p>
         <p>--Sir _Jeffery_ now is laid in dust,</p>
         <p>But when alive, how good, how just!</p>
         <p>And all who knew him well must know</p>
         <p>He never wish'd to use me so.</p>
         <p>Had he believ'd his end so nigh,</p>
         <p>I should have had the legacy,</p>
         <p>Which would have made me full amends</p>
         <p>For loss of fortune, loss of friends.</p>
         <p>Another day had he surviv'd,</p>
         <p>To the next morning had he liv'd,</p>
         <p>It might, perhaps, have been my fate</p>
         <p>To know an independent state,</p>
         <p>As he had told me, o'er and o'er,</p>
         <p>I ne'er should go to service more.</p>
         <p>When I did on his wants attend</p>
         <p>He spoke as a familiar friend:</p>
         <p>How often too we might be seen</p>
         <p>Chatting within the Indian screen!</p>
         <p>Whenever we were left alone,</p>
         <p>We seem'd not two, but were as one.</p>
         <p>I knew each tit-bit that he lov'd;</p>
         <p>He always what I gave approv'd;</p>
         <p>And as I stood beside his chair,</p>
         <p>Attending with respectful air,</p>
         <p>He oft would bid me sit and dine,</p>
         <p>Fill up his glass and pour out mine.</p>
         <p>--When thumb and finger he applied</p>
         <p>To the gold snuff box by his side,</p>
         <p>I shar'd the pinch, and he ne'er ceas'd</p>
         <p>To say, 'God bless you,' when I sneez'd;</p>
         <p>Nay, when my snortings I repeated,</p>
         <p>He thus my awkward flurry greeted,</p>
         <p>'My friend, familiarize your nose</p>
         <p>To this exhilarating dose,</p>
         <p>For sure as we together dine</p>
         <p>This box, QUÆ GENUS, shall be thine!'</p>
         <p>But that kind friend, alas! is dead,</p>
         <p>And box and snuff and all are fled.</p>
         <p>Nay, had I now a hope on earth,</p>
         <p>And could engage in trifling mirth,</p>
         <p>I here might my complainings close</p>
         <p>With disappointments of my nose.</p>
         <p>--His common purse I could command,</p>
         <p>'Twas daily open to my hand;</p>
         <p>You all well know I paid his bills,</p>
         <p>And when, to ease his various ills,</p>
         <p>Sir _Midriff_ came, I us'd to squeeze</p>
         <p>Into his palm the welcome fees.</p>
         <p>Whene'er I showed my weekly book,</p>
         <p>He never gave the page a look;</p>
         <p>And when I urg'd it the good Knight</p>
         <p>Would smile and say, 'I'm sure 'tis right.'</p>
         <p>Nay, I can say, in ev'ry sense,</p>
         <p>I ne'er abus'd his confidence:</p>
         <p>No, no, I never did purloin</p>
         <p>An atom of the lowest coin,</p>
         <p>And what I have to Heaven is known,</p>
         <p>In honest truth, to be my own,</p>
         <p>Then wonder not, I feel it hard,</p>
         <p>To be depriv'd of my reward,</p>
         <p>And, by such a chance, be hurl'd</p>
         <p>Again to struggle with the world.</p>
         <p>Reasons, besides, I must not tell,</p>
         <p>Why the Knight treated me so well;</p>
         <p>But I play'd no delusive part,</p>
         <p>And they did honour to his heart:</p>
         <p>Of that heart, had he left a share, }</p>
         <p>As well as fortune to his heir, }</p>
         <p>I need not now indulge despair." }</p>
         <p>"Mr. QUÆ GENUS, never fear,"</p>
         <p>The Coachman said, "your spirits cheer!</p>
         <p>Dame Fortune has look'd down 'tis plain,</p>
         <p>But the jade may look up again:</p>
         <p>'Tis true that dev'lish oyster-pie</p>
         <p>Fell souse upon the legacy:</p>
         <p>E'en so it was, I cannot doubt it,</p>
         <p>But I would think no more about it.</p>
         <p>You so well know your P's and Q's,</p>
         <p>That you have but to pick and chuse.</p>
         <p>I speak the truth, there are but few</p>
         <p>Mr. QUÆ GENUS, such as you:</p>
         <p>And though the merchant will not give</p>
         <p>The bounty which you should receive,</p>
         <p>What though he would not spare a farthing</p>
         <p>To save a soul of us from starving,</p>
         <p>Good names he'll give us, as he ought,</p>
         <p>For they we know will cost him nought;</p>
         <p>'Twere better therefore to be civil,</p>
         <p>And hold the candle to the Devil,</p>
         <p>For we as servants cannot stir</p>
         <p>Without a show of character.</p>
         <p>--As you perceive, I'm not a chick,</p>
         <p>And know enough to make one sick:</p>
         <p>Nay, somewhat my experience lends,</p>
         <p>To guess at this world's odds and ends.</p>
         <p>I've been in many curious places;</p>
         <p>I've serv'd my Lords,--and serv'd their Graces;</p>
         <p>And, which gives work of more ado,</p>
         <p>I've even serv'd my Ladies too:</p>
         <p>I knew to shut or ope my eyes,</p>
         <p>To see strange things, nor look surprise.</p>
         <p>Sometimes good-luck has given a lift,</p>
         <p>And sometimes, I've been turn'd adrift;</p>
         <p>But should I live to Judgement-day,</p>
         <p>No, I will never fail to say,</p>
         <p>That I ne'er so much comfort knew,</p>
         <p>As since this house was rul'd by you.</p>
         <p>--Now, when you get an upper place,</p>
         <p>Which soon, I'm sure, must be the case,</p>
         <p>If then your favour will contrive,</p>
         <p>I should my Lord or Lady drive,</p>
         <p>For I the reins can handle true</p>
         <p>Of pairs, of fours, and sixes too,</p>
         <p>I promise, nay, my word engages</p>
         <p>To give you poundage from my wages.</p>
         <p>--I know you're gen'rous, kind and free,</p>
         <p>But here you will accord with me,</p>
         <p>That interest has a powerful weight</p>
         <p>Both with the little and the great:</p>
         <p>You see it well by what is past,</p>
         <p>Since your fine plan is overcast.</p>
         <p>I do not wish to give offence,</p>
         <p>But interest is common sense,</p>
         <p>And he who does not look to that,</p>
         <p>Mr. QUÆ GENUS, is a FLAT."</p>
         <p>The blunt, rough _Coachman_, said no more:</p>
         <p>When _Molly's_ fine black eyes ran o'er:</p>
         <p>The _Cook_ look'd grave, and _Betty_ sigh'd, }</p>
         <p>The _Kitchen-maid_ sat still and cried, }</p>
         <p>While _Thomas_ not a word replied.-- }</p>
         <p>QUÆ GENUS, not to be remiss,</p>
         <p>Gave to each maid a friendly kiss,</p>
         <p>And when he whisper'd his adieu</p>
         <p>To charming _Molly_, he gave two:</p>
         <p>Perhaps, if they were counted o'er,</p>
         <p>Her sweet lips might acknowledge more:</p>
         <p>Then told her softly not to fear,</p>
         <p>And kindly whisper'd in her ear,</p>
         <p>"What e'er my lot, I will be true</p>
         <p>To fond affection and to you."</p>
         <p>Our gloomy Hero now departed,</p>
         <p>And left the mansion heavy-hearted,</p>
         <p>Where in such comfort he had liv'd,</p>
         <p>Nor, till dismiss'd it, ever griev'd,</p>
         <p>And, with a tardy step, retir'd</p>
         <p>To a snug lodging he had hir'd.</p>
         <p>Thus once again by Fortune thrown</p>
         <p>On the wide world, and all alone,</p>
         <p>Without th' appearance of a friend</p>
         <p>On whose kind aid he could depend,</p>
         <p>QUÆ GENUS pac'd his lonely floor</p>
         <p>All to and fro and o'er and o'er,</p>
         <p>Thinking what efforts might be made,</p>
         <p>What stroke be struck, what game be play'd,</p>
         <p>To place him in some active state</p>
         <p>That promis'd to be fortunate.</p>
         <p>One consolation he possest, }</p>
         <p>Which, though it did not charm to rest }</p>
         <p>The rising troubles of his breast, }</p>
         <p>Yet still, whatever might confound him,</p>
         <p>Gave him full time to look around him,</p>
         <p>And, on whatever project bent,</p>
         <p>To weigh its views, and wait th' event.</p>
         <p>For, though his purse might not run o'er,</p>
         <p>He had a snug, sufficient store,</p>
         <p>To keep his anxious spirits free</p>
         <p>From any dread of penury,</p>
         <p>And guard him amidst toils and strife,</p>
         <p>Against the insidious smiles of life,</p>
         <p>That do so often tempt the mind</p>
         <p>To cast discretion far behind,</p>
         <p>Or make it fearful hazards try,</p>
         <p>Impell'd by dire necessity.</p>
         <p>--He had not yet unripp'd his coat, }</p>
         <p>In which conceal'd lay every note }</p>
         <p>Which he from _Gripe-all's_ clutches got: }</p>
         <p>A hoard on which he might depend,</p>
         <p>When he look'd round nor saw a friend.</p>
         <p>Besides, he had no trifle gain'd,</p>
         <p>While with Sir _Jeffery_ he remain'd;</p>
         <p>For though, as has been lately said,</p>
         <p>He never play'd a trick of trade;</p>
         <p>Nor had he even thought it right</p>
         <p>To take a valet's perquisite,</p>
         <p>Nor e'er allow'd his hands to seize</p>
         <p>The household steward's common fees,</p>
         <p>But of the strict and rigid law</p>
         <p>Of duty ever stood in awe.</p>
         <p>--All this the Knight full well believ'd,</p>
         <p>Nor could he think himself deceiv'd,</p>
         <p>When once he answer'd to a friend,</p>
         <p>Who did the young man's cares commend.</p>
         <p>"That same QUÆ GENUS is so just</p>
         <p>In all committed to his trust,</p>
         <p>To his right notions such a slave,</p>
         <p>He would not with a razor shave,</p>
         <p>Nor use a strap, nor ply a hone,</p>
         <p>He had not purchas'd as his own."--</p>
         <p>Thus, as most worthy of his charge,</p>
         <p>Sir _Jeffery's_ annual pay was large,</p>
         <p>And when th' allotted quarter came,</p>
         <p>Something was added to his claim,</p>
         <p>Which with such gen'rous grace was given,</p>
         <p>It seem'd like Manna sent from Heaven!--</p>
         <p>Besides, his wages, being high,</p>
         <p>Encreas'd the gen'ral legacy,</p>
         <p>Which he with all the household shar'd;</p>
         <p>The last, and now his sole reward.</p>
         <p>Thus so far independence brought</p>
         <p>A'gleam of comfort on his thought;</p>
         <p>He was not left on ruin's brink</p>
         <p>To sit and sigh, and swear and think.</p>
         <p>_Two_ points alone he had in view,</p>
         <p>He thought it hard they were but _two_;</p>
         <p>Nor could he call his fortune kind</p>
         <p>When they alone employ'd his mind:</p>
         <p>These were the DOCTORS, won by fees</p>
         <p>To make most bounteous promises;</p>
         <p>And though these GALENS might deny 'em,</p>
         <p>He was at least resolv'd to try 'em;</p>
         <p>And, if Sir MIDRIFF should decline,</p>
         <p>He would apply to ANODYNE.</p>
         <p>--The _former_, if he pleas'd, could well,</p>
         <p>And with strict truth, his value tell:</p>
         <p>For none with such experience knew</p>
         <p>That he was active, honest, true,</p>
         <p>And to his patient, well or ill,</p>
         <p>Did ev'ry duteous care fulfil.</p>
         <p>Nay, that it was the Knight's good pleasure</p>
         <p>To speak of him as of a treasure.</p>
         <p>Now, on his serious purpose bent,</p>
         <p>He to Sir MIDRIFF BOLUS went;</p>
         <p>But then, alas! as we shall see,</p>
         <p>His face did not forebode a fee:</p>
         <p>Nor did the great man smiling meet him,</p>
         <p>Or with a tone familiar greet him,</p>
         <p>As his keen humour us'd to do</p>
         <p>When _golden sovereigns_ were in view:</p>
         <p>Nor did he take him by the hand,</p>
         <p>As when it did the coin command.</p>
         <p>He now put on a curious leer,</p>
         <p>That said, "I pray, what brought _you_ here?"</p>
         <p>"I'm come to hope you'll condescend</p>
         <p>To prove yourself my promis'd friend,"</p>
         <p>QUÆ GENUS said, "and with this view,</p>
         <p>I now present myself to you.</p>
         <p>You told me, 'when your master's gone,</p>
         <p>Look on my friendship as your own.'</p>
         <p>He's gone, alas, I too well know,</p>
         <p>To me a most affecting blow:</p>
         <p>But still, I trust, I may engage</p>
         <p>Your kind, protecting patronage,</p>
         <p>And, among those of rank and wealth</p>
         <p>Who make you guardian of their health,</p>
         <p>Your favour may smile on my fate,</p>
         <p>And I renew an household state,</p>
         <p>Like that which crown'd my better days,</p>
         <p>When I enjoy'd your frequent praise."</p>
         <p>The Doctor now his suppliant ey'd,</p>
         <p>And thus in hasty tone replied.</p>
         <p>"Indeed I've something else to do</p>
         <p>Than thus to be employ'd by you:</p>
         <p>I'm in great haste and must away,</p>
         <p>My patients wait, I cannot stay,</p>
         <p>To hear you, your fine story tell:--</p>
         <p>So, honest friend, I wish you well."--</p>
         <p>--Thus when Sir _Jeffery's_ fees were o'er</p>
         <p>He thought not of QUÆ GENUS more.</p>
         <p>Now, as he pac'd along the street, }</p>
         <p>Thus did he to himself repeat, }</p>
         <p>"Is this the fortune I must meet? }</p>
         <p>Is this the merited reward</p>
         <p>Which they receive who strive to guard</p>
         <p>Their hearts against the tempting guise</p>
         <p>Of int'rest and its sorceries;</p>
         <p>And say to Virtue, 'Maid divine!</p>
         <p>Behold thy slave, I'm wholly thine!'</p>
         <p>--It is not that I now repent,</p>
         <p>Or harbour selfish discontent,</p>
         <p>That I should hesitate to seize</p>
         <p>The golden opportunities</p>
         <p>Which were presented to my power,</p>
         <p>Not ev'ry day, but ev'ry hour,</p>
         <p>While with Sir _Jeffery Gourmand_ I</p>
         <p>Enjoy'd the means those arts to ply,</p>
         <p>Which, by the curious eye unseen,</p>
         <p>Might with such gains have pregnant been:</p>
         <p>No, no, thank Heaven, I'm not embued</p>
         <p>With that worst vice, Ingratitude;</p>
         <p>An odious vice that is of kin</p>
         <p>To every other mortal sin.</p>
         <p>I felt his kindness, and where'er</p>
         <p>My lot may be of pain and care,</p>
         <p>Those kind reflections I possess</p>
         <p>To make me smile in my distress,</p>
         <p>That I ne'er for a moment swerv'd</p>
         <p>From the best duties he deserv'd;</p>
         <p>Nay, which he, to his closing days,</p>
         <p>So often honour'd with his praise,--</p>
         <p>And should it be my lot to find</p>
         <p>Another master good and kind,</p>
         <p>Whose gen'rous heart would condescend</p>
         <p>To treat QUÆ GENUS as a friend,</p>
         <p>This I may truly boast, that he }</p>
         <p>Should find an humble friend in me, }</p>
         <p>Whose soul is faithful loyalty! }</p>
         <p>I would the path of truth pursue</p>
         <p>As I have long been us'd to do;</p>
         <p>And where, howe'er oblig'd to bend</p>
         <p>To pressing views, my wishes tend.</p>
         <p>But, in this world of chance and change,</p>
         <p>As it appears, I'm doom'd to range,</p>
         <p>And I may be oblig'd to treat it</p>
         <p>As it will be my lot to meet it.</p>
         <p>I will not rob nor will I steal, }</p>
         <p>But from myself I'll not conceal }</p>
         <p>The secret purpose which I feel. }</p>
         <p>Commandments I will never break,</p>
         <p>But when fair interest is at stake,</p>
         <p>I'll follow in my future views</p>
         <p>The conduct which the world pursues;</p>
         <p>And when that principle I own,</p>
         <p>The world will have no right to frown.</p>
         <p>Thus whatsoe'er may be my station,</p>
         <p>Where chance may fix my next vocation</p>
         <p>I'll keep discretion in my view,</p>
         <p>As prudent folk profess to do.</p>
         <p>--But ere throughout the town at large</p>
         <p>I look for some inviting charge,</p>
         <p>Though with one Doctor I have fail'd,</p>
         <p>Another now shall be assail'd;</p>
         <p>Though brilliant prospects may not shine,</p>
         <p>Yet I'll e'en go to ANODYNE.</p>
         <p>The QUACK may prove a better friend</p>
         <p>Than e'er Sir MIDRIFF might intend;</p>
         <p>At all events, howe'er perverse,</p>
         <p>'Tis plain he cannot prove a worse;</p>
         <p>Howe'er that be, I can but try."--</p>
         <p>--Thus clos'd his thoughts' soliloquy.</p>
         <p>QUÆ GENUS now pass'd up the Court</p>
         <p>The sickly patient's still resort,</p>
         <p>Where, in a corner quite retired,</p>
         <p>The mansion stood which he desired,</p>
         <p>Whose door, bedight with darksome green</p>
         <p>And mouldings edg'd with black, is seen;</p>
         <p>While letter'd gold appears to shine</p>
         <p>And tell the name of ANODYNE.</p>
         <p>He touch'd the well-known tinkling-bell</p>
         <p>That did some sickly presence tell,</p>
         <p>When the door op'd with rapid force,</p>
         <p>And patients glided in of course.</p>
         <p>There was ne'er heard a knocker's sound,</p>
         <p>To rouse the idle neighbours round,</p>
         <p>Or to the windows call the eye</p>
         <p>Of peeping curiosity.</p>
         <p>The signal was not given twice;</p>
         <p>QUÆ GENUS enter'd in a trice</p>
         <p>And sought the solemn Doctor's nook,</p>
         <p>Where he sat with a folio book,</p>
         <p>Some ancient Galen's learned creed,</p>
         <p>Which 'tis not certain he could read:</p>
         <p>Alone, o'er this he gravely doz'd,</p>
         <p>But when the sick arriv'd, he clos'd</p>
         <p>The cumbrous volume, and gave ear</p>
         <p>The tale of some distress to hear.</p>
         <p>To JOHNNY this was no new scene,</p>
         <p>For here he had full often been,</p>
         <p>But as he _fee-less_ ne'er before</p>
         <p>Had hasten'd through the well-known door,</p>
         <p>He felt some doubts within his mind</p>
         <p>What sort of welcome he should find.</p>
         <p>Sir MIDRIFF'S conduct it appears,</p>
         <p>Had chang'd his promis'd hopes to fears;</p>
         <p>And when he felt such rude disdain</p>
         <p>From one who rul'd in Warwick-Lane,</p>
         <p>Who boasted of superior knowledge</p>
         <p>To all the learned of the College;</p>
         <p>Who from his frequent promise swerv'd,</p>
         <p>To one who his kind smiles deserv'd;</p>
         <p>Yet ev'ry day, and ev'ry hour,</p>
         <p>Possess'd the patronising power,</p>
         <p>With mere commending words to gain</p>
         <p>The boon QUÆ GENUS ask'd in vain;--</p>
         <p>What good then could his hopes supply</p>
         <p>From the low pride of quackery,</p>
         <p>From one who rested his pretence</p>
         <p>On nostrums and on impudence.</p>
         <p>But he had felt that in Life's dance,</p>
         <p>We often owe to strokes of chance,</p>
         <p>That unexpected good prevail'd</p>
         <p>Where Reason's better hopes have fail'd.</p>
         <p>Such thoughts the purpose did incline</p>
         <p>To make his bows to ANODYNE.</p>
         <p>The Doctor with a friendly air, }</p>
         <p>'Rose from his dictatorial chair, }</p>
         <p>And pleasure told to see him there: }</p>
         <p>When thus QUÆ GENUS in reply,</p>
         <p>Began the following Colloquy.</p>
         <p>QUÆ GENUS.</p>
         <p>"Sir _Jeffery_, as, I trust, you know,</p>
         <p>Is gone, Sir, where we all must go;</p>
         <p>In spite of all your healing power,</p>
         <p>Has reach'd, at length, his final hour,</p>
         <p>Though had he trusted all to you, }</p>
         <p>And to Sir MIDRIFF bade adieu, }</p>
         <p>Which he was half inclin'd to do, }</p>
         <p>Perhaps, my present visit here</p>
         <p>Would not so penniless appear;</p>
         <p>For I am come, as you must see,</p>
         <p>Without the pass-port of a fee.</p>
         <p>It is self-interest, I fear,</p>
         <p>Yes, I must own it, brings me here.</p>
         <p>Since his departure I am hurl'd</p>
         <p>To push my fortune in the world,</p>
         <p>And may I now with courage say,</p>
         <p>You will assist me on my way?</p>
         <p>--Such is, alas! my alter'd case,</p>
         <p>I'm seeking for another place,</p>
         <p>Though e'en my visionary mind</p>
         <p>Can never hope again to find</p>
         <p>Such a so envied household post,</p>
         <p>As that which I have lately lost.</p>
         <p>With fortune I shall ne'er contend</p>
         <p>But smile on that which she may send;</p>
         <p>And of whatever state possest,</p>
         <p>Be satisfied and act my best.</p>
         <p>Now, as I've reason well to know,</p>
         <p>Though 'tis not you have told me so,</p>
         <p>That persons of superior worth,</p>
         <p>The wealthy and of noble birth;</p>
         <p>Who, tir'd of physic's settled rules,</p>
         <p>As taught in colleges and schools,</p>
         <p>Have sought your bold and fearless skill,</p>
         <p>The potent drafts and secret pill,</p>
         <p>Which your _Acumen_ can impart,</p>
         <p>Beyond the reach of drudging art,</p>
         <p>And I have heard will cure the pain,</p>
         <p>When boasting science tries in vain:</p>
         <p>Nor is this all, the tonish fair</p>
         <p>Attend to seek your healing care.</p>
         <p>When here I've for Sir _Jeffery_ been, }</p>
         <p>Dames of high figure I have seen, }</p>
         <p>Lolling behind your folding screen }</p>
         <p>With all their gay caricatures</p>
         <p>The lively eye's attractive lures.</p>
         <p>Broad bonnets all beflower'd o'er,</p>
         <p>Are often passing through your door,</p>
         <p>And I have glanc'd at many a shawl</p>
         <p>That glided through your gloomy hall.</p>
         <p>When such grand visitors as these</p>
         <p>Apply to you to give them ease;</p>
         <p>And when your skill relieves their pain,</p>
         <p>That is the time their grace to gain,</p>
         <p>And then, good Doctor, you might see</p>
         <p>If you could gain a grace for me;</p>
         <p>While to some patient you commend</p>
         <p>The service of your humble friend:</p>
         <p>Nor will he fail returns to make,</p>
         <p>Which you may condescend to take;</p>
         <p>And grateful memory will repay</p>
         <p>Your kindness to his dying day."</p>
         <p>The modest suit was not denied,</p>
         <p>And thus, th' assenting Don replied.</p>
         <p>"QUÆ GENUS, my regards are thine,</p>
         <p>As sure as my name's ANODYNE.</p>
         <p>--If worth lay in a flatt'ring tongue,</p>
         <p>You would not want a service long;</p>
         <p>For if you do with caution use it,</p>
         <p>Where is the ear that will refuse it?</p>
         <p>'Tis but the art how to apply</p>
         <p>The well-conceal'd artillery,</p>
         <p>And, more or less, the well-told tale</p>
         <p>Will o'er the pliant mind prevail.</p>
         <p>Your int'rest, friend, I'll not neglect,</p>
         <p>Perhaps do more than you expect;</p>
         <p>Nay, I e'en may your mind surprise,</p>
         <p>When I mark how that int'rest lies;--</p>
         <p>But 'tis not where your hopes may look,</p>
         <p>'Tis not that page in fortune's book.</p>
         <p>--The higher folk who come to me</p>
         <p>Are all involv'd in secrecy:</p>
         <p>Those who can't walk employ a hack,</p>
         <p>When they employ the humble quack:</p>
         <p>Hence, no fine carriages resort</p>
         <p>About the purlieus of my court,</p>
         <p>For the rich owners, with their wealth,</p>
         <p>Blush to pass this bye-way to health.</p>
         <p>Such is proud fashion's powerful rule</p>
         <p>O'er many a purse-proud, titled fool:</p>
         <p>They tell me all their sickness claims,</p>
         <p>But seem afraid to tell their names.</p>
         <p>--There's an old man I sometimes see,</p>
         <p>And faith he brings a handsome fee,</p>
         <p>Whose hackney always drops his fare</p>
         <p>Just by, in the adjoining Square:</p>
         <p>Where, when we've clos'd our consultation,</p>
         <p>He hobbles to regain his station.</p>
         <p>In a loose coat of common wear,</p>
         <p>This person chuses to appear;</p>
         <p>With his round hat and dingy caxon,</p>
         <p>He calls himself a Mr. Jackson;</p>
         <p>Though still his manners and his words</p>
         <p>Are such as highest rank affords:</p>
         <p>And, sure as I e'er gave a puke,</p>
         <p>I know the man to be a duke.--</p>
         <p>But I, of course, the secret keep,</p>
         <p>And let his splendid titles sleep.</p>
         <p>--I have two ladies now in hand,</p>
         <p>Whose whims and fancies I command:</p>
         <p>They tell of humours on the skin,</p>
         <p>But then they only shew their chin;</p>
         <p>No other part they let me see,</p>
         <p>Such is their bashful fantasy.</p>
         <p>They seem to think I doubt their graces,</p>
         <p>As veils o'erspread their pimpled faces,</p>
         <p>So that where'er they chuse to show 'em,</p>
         <p>I do not think that I should know 'em.</p>
         <p>Yet by their chat they have betray'd,</p>
         <p>That one's a wife, and one's a maid:</p>
         <p>Nor from the names can they refrain</p>
         <p>Of _Lady Bell_ and _Lady Jane_.</p>
         <p>They never fail in their appointments,</p>
         <p>And are fast curing by my ointments:</p>
         <p>Thus, from their praise, I hope to claim</p>
         <p>An added honour to my name.</p>
         <p>Nor are these all; for many more }</p>
         <p>Of wealth and rank pass through my door; }</p>
         <p>Though still as I have said before, }</p>
         <p>They to such aid as mine apply</p>
         <p>All mask'd in fearful secrecy.</p>
         <p>These whims I have explain'd, to prove</p>
         <p>I cannot in this quarter move;</p>
         <p>And where I could your worth commend</p>
         <p>It would degrade you to attend.</p>
         <p>But I shall now unfold to view,</p>
         <p>Another chance I have for you:</p>
         <p>And let your patience ope its ear</p>
         <p>To all you are about to hear.</p>
         <p>"'Tis not to breathe the tonish air }</p>
         <p>Of Portland-Place, or Grosv'nor-Square, }</p>
         <p>Or stand behind her Grace's chair: }</p>
         <p>'Tis not to serve the titled beaux,</p>
         <p>And flourish in your master' clothes:</p>
         <p>'Tis not, as you are wont, to grace</p>
         <p>Some peopled household's highest place,</p>
         <p>Though well-accomplish'd as you are,</p>
         <p>'Tis chance alone can place you there:</p>
         <p>For, through your days, you may not boast</p>
         <p>A master such as you have lost;</p>
         <p>Nay, your precarious life may end</p>
         <p>Before a master proves a friend;</p>
         <p>And, after all, old age may come</p>
         <p>Without an alms-house for a home.</p>
         <p>Think, think in what a woeful plight</p>
         <p>The man must live who's pocket's light!</p>
         <p>Are not his hours by want depress'd?</p>
         <p>Penurious care corrodes his breast;</p>
         <p>Without respect, or love, or friends,</p>
         <p>His solitary day descends.</p>
         <p>O be not led away by pride,</p>
         <p>But use the means that may provide</p>
         <p>For future wants, when evils press,</p>
         <p>And life is pregnant with distress!</p>
         <p>Hear me, my friend, nor let surprise</p>
         <p>With staring looks burst from your eyes,</p>
         <p>When I, in language frank and free,--</p>
         <p>Tell you to come and _live with me_.</p>
         <p>"Think not I want you for a hack,</p>
         <p>A serving menial to a quack;</p>
         <p>If to my interests you attend, }</p>
         <p>You will be treated as a friend. }</p>
         <p>On this be sure you may depend, }</p>
         <p>That you will find a better station,</p>
         <p>In profit as in inclination,</p>
         <p>Than were you hired to be solus</p>
         <p>Behind the chair of Doctor BOLUS.</p>
         <p>--Within a week, perhaps a day,</p>
         <p>You'll see the part you have to play.</p>
         <p>The man I had, whom you have seen,</p>
         <p>Might still beneath this roof have been,</p>
         <p>But he by coughing was worn down</p>
         <p>To a poor gasping skeleton,</p>
         <p>And 'twere not fit I should endure</p>
         <p>One in my house I could not cure</p>
         <p>He would not prove a tempting sign</p>
         <p>To spread the fame of ANODYNE:</p>
         <p>But in the time he here remain'd,</p>
         <p>He had a little fortune gain'd.</p>
         <p>--Your knowledge, which I well can trace, }</p>
         <p>Is far above a servant's place, }</p>
         <p>And would a higher station grace. }</p>
         <p>The pleasing manners you possess,</p>
         <p>Your winning speech and nice address,</p>
         <p>Might call to your ambitious view,</p>
         <p>An higher state than you pursue;</p>
         <p>Though still your savings you might waste,</p>
         <p>Before you're suited to your taste.</p>
         <p>--Such aid as your's I long have wanted,</p>
         <p>And if my warm proposal's granted,</p>
         <p>You must at once grow wond'rous dull,</p>
         <p>Or soon your pocket will be full:</p>
         <p>Here, in one year, you will get more</p>
         <p>Than with your noble lords in four.</p>
         <p>Nay, on the honour of a friend,</p>
         <p>Who no deception can intend,</p>
         <p>You'll greatly err, if you decline</p>
         <p>Such an official place as mine.</p>
         <p>--I'll teach you how to cup and bleed;</p>
         <p>These operations you will need;</p>
         <p>The pulses' movements you shall know,</p>
         <p>When they are either high or low:</p>
         <p>While other symptoms of disease</p>
         <p>I can communicate with ease.</p>
         <p>All this, if I the truth discern,</p>
         <p>Your ready mind will quickly learn.</p>
         <p>Besides 'tis right to let you know</p>
         <p>You'll have no nauseous work to do;</p>
         <p>For the old woman spreads the blisters,</p>
         <p>Rolls up the pills and stirs the clysters.</p>
         <p>While 'tis my hand alone composes</p>
         <p>The patients' necessary doses,</p>
         <p>And your chief care is to dispense</p>
         <p>These med'cines with your eloquence.</p>
         <p>--But I have sick folk to attend,</p>
         <p>So while away an hour, my friend:</p>
         <p>And as I trust you'll stay and dine,</p>
         <p id="ca6">We'll close our bargain o'er our wine."</p>
         <p>CANTO VI</p>
         <p>It often happens as we range</p>
         <p>Through life, an unexpected change,</p>
         <p>With sudden stroke may pain destroy</p>
         <p>And turn our thoughts from grief to joy:</p>
         <p>Or as some shock cuts off relief</p>
         <p>May turn a flow of joy to grief.</p>
         <p>Thus our days' varying system bears</p>
         <p>Th' alternate play of hopes and fears:</p>
         <p>Nay, when more pleasant views provoke,</p>
         <p>May turn our gravity to joke.</p>
         <p>Besides, as in the Drama's art,</p>
         <p>The scene displays the varying part,</p>
         <p>So apt are we to play the fool,</p>
         <p>We serve for our own ridicule:</p>
         <p>And when sly Fortune's pleas'd to vary</p>
         <p>Our progress with some strange vagary,</p>
         <p>We oft become such merry elves</p>
         <p>To burst with laughter at ourselves.</p>
         <p>Thus as QUÆ GENUS pac'd the room,</p>
         <p>Reflecting on the time to come,</p>
         <p>And all the heap of promis'd good</p>
         <p>By ANODYNE to be bestow'd;</p>
         <p>That he was to be cramm'd with wealth,</p>
         <p>And turn all sickness into health;</p>
         <p>His fancy, tickled at the thought,</p>
         <p>He set each serious wish at nought,</p>
         <p>And laugh'd till his sides seem'd to crack,</p>
         <p>To think he should become a Quack.</p>
         <p>But when he had indulg'd the joke</p>
         <p>Which this idea might provoke,</p>
         <p>He thought more gravely of the case</p>
         <p>And vow'd to take the proffer'd place:</p>
         <p>At all events, he could but try</p>
         <p>This self-same scheme of quackery:</p>
         <p>At least some knowledge he should gain,</p>
         <p>And knowledge never comes in vain.</p>
         <p>Indeed, what harm, if he succeed in</p>
         <p>The arts of cupping and of bleeding?</p>
         <p>The lancet's power to command</p>
         <p>Might be of use in any hand,</p>
         <p>And e'en in any hand might save</p>
         <p>A forlorn suff'rer from the grave;</p>
         <p>While he might well instructed be</p>
         <p>In principles of Pharmacy.</p>
         <p>He also felt that application</p>
         <p>Might fit him for a better station;</p>
         <p>That in some distant country town,</p>
         <p>He might a _Galen's_ title own:</p>
         <p>Where, if his fortune did not vary,</p>
         <p>He might strut an Apothecary.</p>
         <p>Thus between gravity and smile</p>
         <p>Conceit play'd its full part the while,</p>
         <p>Though not without a view to gains</p>
         <p>Which might reward his present pains:</p>
         <p>Indeed he knew the means that made 'em,</p>
         <p>For he had for Sir _Jeffery_ paid 'em:</p>
         <p>As while for potion, pill and plaister</p>
         <p>A golden fee awaits the master;</p>
         <p>He found it was a useful plan,</p>
         <p>With lesser coin, to fee the man,</p>
         <p>Who had the means to lift the latch</p>
         <p>That did the secret wish dispatch;</p>
         <p>And could th' impatience set to rest</p>
         <p>Of the more eager, grumbling guest.</p>
         <p>--Thus, with lively hope high-season'd,</p>
         <p>QUÆ GENUS walk'd about and reason'd;</p>
         <p>And, in his Pericranium fast,</p>
         <p>This grave opinion fix'd at last:</p>
         <p>If not in honour, yet in purse,</p>
         <p>_He might go further and fare worse_,--</p>
         <p>But if no other good were done,</p>
         <p>There might be sure a world of fun.</p>

         <p>QUÆ GENUS WITH A QUACK DOCTOR.]</p>
         <p>Patients that morning had been plenty,</p>
         <p>Not less it seems than five-and-twenty;</p>
         <p>This the old woman smiling stated,</p>
         <p>And told him that the dinner waited.</p>
         <p>The table shew'd a plenteous treat }</p>
         <p>Of fish and fowl and sav'ry meat, }</p>
         <p>But poor QUÆ GENUS scarce could eat. }</p>
         <p>For, though prepar'd for any diet,</p>
         <p>His hunger soon repos'd in quiet.</p>
         <p>The Doctor fed, but talk'd the while,</p>
         <p>Of gastric juice and flowing bile;</p>
         <p>Of kidneys and o'ergrowing liver,</p>
         <p>As of sore eyes now cur'd for ever;</p>
         <p>What his fam'd _Nostrum_ had perform'd,</p>
         <p>And how it had the bowels storm'd</p>
         <p>Of guttling Gourmand with such force,</p>
         <p>That it a passage made of course,</p>
         <p>Which three great Doctors tried in vain,</p>
         <p>With all their boasted skill to gain.</p>
         <p>Besides our hero did not know</p>
         <p>How cookery went on below,</p>
         <p>And he might think, poor dainty sinner,</p>
         <p>That the same hands had dress'd the dinner,</p>
         <p>Which were entrusted with the care</p>
         <p>Each daily med'cine to prepare;</p>
         <p>To melt the salves and spread anon</p>
         <p>The cerates and diacolon;</p>
         <p>That did the drugs or grind or pound,</p>
         <p>And dress the sore leg's running wound:</p>
         <p>But so it was, a sick sensation</p>
         <p>Check'd all his powers of mastication,</p>
         <p>And caus'd his stomach to resent</p>
         <p>The very taste of nutriment:</p>
         <p>Nay his sad appetite approv'd</p>
         <p>When all the dishes were remov'd.</p>
         <p>--They therefore soon had ceas'd to dine }</p>
         <p>And o'er the second pint of wine }</p>
         <p>The bargain clos'd with ANODYNE. }</p>
         <p>What that was, it is fit to know,</p>
         <p>And the verse now will briefly show.</p>
         <p>QUÆ GENUS had made up his mind</p>
         <p>Not to his interest to be blind;</p>
         <p>But in the game that path pursue</p>
         <p>Which prudence says we ought to do,</p>
         <p>Nor to let scruples overpower</p>
         <p>Th' advantage of the passing hour,</p>
         <p>And yet that artifice restrain</p>
         <p>Whose daily efforts are for gain:</p>
         <p>In short to take the middle plan, }</p>
         <p>Which, as the world is us'd to scan, }</p>
         <p>Marks what is call'd an _Honest Man_. }</p>
         <p>He might not hesitate complying</p>
         <p>With a small spice of useful lying</p>
         <p>That idle questions might disarm,</p>
         <p>Do some slight good, but never harm,</p>
         <p>Afford a sentimental grace</p>
         <p>To conversation's common place,</p>
         <p>And give a customary aid</p>

         <p>With mind thus settled and prepar'd</p>
         <p>He ANODYNE'S first lecture heard.</p>

         <p>We shall pass over all the rest.</p>
         <p>ANODYNE.</p>
         <p>"This the first rule that I shall trace:--</p>
         <p>You must command a solemn face;</p>
         <p>Nor suffer objects to beguile</p>
         <p>Your features to familiar smile.</p>
         <p>Here, I must own, you oft may see</p>
         <p>What may court transient pleasantry;</p>
         <p>For e'en 'midst misery and pain,</p>
         <p>You'll find such whims and fancies reign,</p>
         <p>Hear patients cough and grunt and sneeze</p>
         <p>In such uncouth, discordant keys,</p>
         <p>That without care, I should not wonder</p>
         <p>Your muscles into laugh might blunder.</p>
         <p>You have a speech runs off at score,</p>
         <p>As rapid as a chaise and four,</p>
         <p>But with my sickly folk be slow</p>
         <p>As a stage-waggon's us'd to go;</p>
         <p>And pray remember to apply</p>
         <p>Your words with due solemnity.</p>
         <p>I know you well can suit your tongue</p>
         <p>To any age, to old or young;</p>
         <p>Nor will the task your care perplex</p>
         <p>In the complaints of either sex;</p>
         <p>And bear in mind, whate'er you see,</p>
         <p>To veil your thoughts with modesty:</p>
         <p>But hear the great and leading rule</p>
         <p>Of this my Esculapian school.</p>
         <p>"I care not by what name you call</p>
         <p>This spacious parlour, room or hall:</p>
         <p>But here my daily patients range</p>
         <p>Whose order you must never change:</p>
         <p>Were I to take them one by one,</p>
         <p>By Heaven I should ne'er have done;</p>
         <p>And, therefore, govern'd by their feather</p>
         <p>I thus assort my birds together.</p>
         <p>Here, on the right, are duly seated</p>
         <p>Those who for gouty freaks are treated,</p>
         <p>Then comes the symptomatic fever,</p>
         <p>And next the bilious and their liver:</p>
         <p>Then follow others in their turn,</p>
         <p>The chills which shake, the heats that burn;</p>
         <p>The stomachs which will ne'er digest</p>
         <p>The food their feeders love the best;</p>
         <p>The wheesers too are not far off,</p>
         <p>All those who hem and spit and cough,</p>
         <p>With such, not of the happiest kind,</p>
         <p>Whose bowels threat to crack with wind</p>
         <p>The Hypochondres here repose</p>
         <p>Impatient for the cordial dose,</p>
         <p>And children on the carpet brawl,</p>
         <p>Till my spice biscuits calm the squall.</p>
         <p>"I first review th' assembled tribe</p>
         <p>Then walk off stately and prescribe,</p>
         <p>When I consign to your quick sense</p>

         <p>Each case that asks superior art</p>
         <p>I send into a room apart;</p>
         <p>And _there_ I never feel alarm;</p>
         <p>I play no tricks and do no harm.</p>
         <p>When I a desp'rate illness see,</p>
         <p>For patients must not die with me,</p>
         <p>I recommend them to repair</p>
         <p>To goat's-milk and the country air;</p>
         <p>And when such counsel they receive</p>
         <p>They do not fail to take their leave,</p>
         <p>Full of my candour and disdain</p>
         <p>Of any little paltry gain.</p>
         <p>Deep cuts, sore legs and gummy eyes,</p>
         <p>With all the common casualties,</p>
         <p>I with my healing dame bestow,</p>
         <p>In her snug, secret cell below:</p>
         <p>Indeed I've sometimes star'd to see</p>
         <p>The wonders of her surgery.</p>
         <p>--'Tis true 'mong doctors I'm not famous,</p>
         <p>But still I'm not an _Ignoramus_;</p>
         <p>For I can play a skillfull part</p>
         <p>In elements of chymic art;</p>
         <p>I give the drafts a varying hue,</p>
         <p>To-day so red, to-morrow blue,</p>
         <p>And touch them with a diff'rent savour,</p>
         <p>To give a worse or better flavour,</p>
         <p>As it may suit, then change their name, }</p>
         <p>Though they may be the very same, }</p>
         <p>Both in their object and their aim. }</p>
         <p>"It is with me a leading fashion</p>
         <p>To play thus with imagination;</p>
         <p>A symptom that doth never cease,</p>
         <p>Or more or less in all disease.</p>
         <p>There are sly shifts in ev'ry trade,</p>
         <p>Which money calls in to its aid:</p>
         <p>But here I'd have it understood,</p>
         <p>If when my practice does no good,</p>
         <p>My conscience never has the qualm,</p>
         <p>That I do any real harm.</p>
         <p>Nor are my various cures unknown</p>
         <p>As placards tell of my renown!</p>
         <p>My nostrums oft my hopes fulfil,</p>
         <p>Nor do I know they ever kill.</p>
         <p>Those cases which I've cause to doubt,</p>
         <p>And cannot find their symptoms out,</p>
         <p>I never fail to leave to nature,</p>
         <p>Who is a wonder-working creature:</p>
         <p>And my chief cures which make a stir,--</p>
         <p>I e'en must own I owe to her.--</p>
         <p>--Such the great object of my care.--</p>
         <p>Fear not, you will th' advantage share.</p>
         <p>But know, when all my sick are here,</p>
         <p>You as _Inferior_ must appear;</p>
         <p>But business o'er and they are gone,</p>
         <p>Then good QUÆ GENUS, we are one!"</p>
         <p>At length the compact was agreed, }</p>
         <p>And all things promis'd to succeed: }</p>
         <p>Our Hero soon could cup and bleed; }</p>
         <p>And, with a kind, officious grace,</p>
         <p>The med'cine gave in time and place;</p>
         <p>Nay, as occasion might afford,</p>
         <p>Bitters improve with sweet'ning word:</p>
         <p>He had acquir'd the art to please</p>
         <p>With welcome flatt'ries such as these.</p>
         <p>"_How stout your legs appear to-day!</p>
         <p>I trust you have walk'd all the way!</p>
         <p>And ere that our brief work is done,</p>
         <p>We shall have taught you how to run!_"</p>
         <p>"_O madam! how I must rejoice,</p>
         <p>That you have lost your husky voice;</p>
         <p>Soon I doubt not that I shall find</p>
         <p>Your tones are of the sweetest kind_!"</p>
         <p>"_And that fine face I griev'd to view</p>
         <p>When cloth'd in such a pallid hue;</p>
         <p>But I have seen, this passing week,</p>
         <p>The colour coming on your cheek.</p>
         <p>And if some ill does not oppose,</p>
         <p>We soon shall see the tender rose:</p>
         <p>And hope's a friend that will supply</p>
         <p>The prospect which, I trust, is nigh_."</p>
         <p>Now sometimes he would give a scope</p>
         <p>To his propensity to joke.</p>
         <p>For 'mid this pale-fac'd, grumbling mess</p>
         <p>'Twere well to stir some chearfulness:</p>
         <p>For if a parson chose to squeeze</p>
         <p>A lady on her crummy knees,</p>
         <p>(For here a little play and prate</p>
         <p>Might cheer a sickly _tête-à-tête_)</p>
         <p>His whisper might perchance declare,</p>
         <p>"Doctor, her pulses are not there."</p>
         <p>--At all events, things went on well,</p>
         <p>As the pleas'd verse may freely tell;</p>
         <p>And the young Doctor ne'er complain'd</p>
         <p>Of what he by his office gain'd.</p>
         <p>But here we now shall change our road</p>
         <p>And slip into an _Episode_;</p>
         <p>It is a common way we know,</p>
         <p>In which much better poets go:</p>
         <p>Though pride will not suggest that we</p>
         <p>Can be accus'd of _poetry_;</p>
         <p>Yet we must own that, in our time,</p>
         <p>We have stirr'd up some reams of _Rhyme_.</p>
         <p>Howe'er that be, we now must come</p>
         <p>To steer our Hero's walks from home.</p>
         <p>Among the few who sought the aid</p>
         <p>Of ANODYNE'S more secret trade,</p>
         <p>Was one who sent a written case</p>
         <p>Which did his various symptoms trace:</p>
         <p>Thus, when the Quack prepar'd the dose,</p>
         <p>QUÆ GENUS took it snug and close:</p>
         <p>He only knew the cordial sent,</p>
         <p>To whom address'd, and where it went:</p>
         <p>Besides it was his daily task</p>
         <p>Questions of import grave to ask.</p>
         <p>How was his pulse? How had he slept?</p>
         <p>If tremors o'er the system crept?</p>
         <p>With such enquiries as our verse</p>
         <p>Might feel it awkward to rehearse.</p>
         <p>Of that no more, the patient's name</p>
         <p>Was _Woodlands_, known in rural fame:</p>
         <p>Through early years, a sportsman he,</p>
         <p>The flower of hunting chivalry;</p>
         <p>Was rich, and as he well was able,</p>
         <p>Saw jovial sportsmen round his table,</p>
         <p>Drank hard and lov'd the evening glee,</p>
         <p>With those who drank as hard as he.</p>
         <p>But gout, with other ills came on,</p>
         <p>And jovial life was pass'd and gone:</p>
         <p>Health's active season now was o'er,</p>
         <p>When he could hunt and feast no more.</p>
         <p>He sold his hounds and took a wife,</p>
         <p>To soothe the latter years of life;</p>
         <p>But they were few, as we shall see,</p>
         <p>In spite of care and Quackery.</p>
         <p>She was a _Belle_ of rural fame,</p>
         <p>Who gave her troth and bore his name:</p>
         <p>Whate'er had been her hopes and views</p>
         <p>When she did an old husband chuse,</p>
         <p>The knowledge we do not profess,</p>
         <p>But leave the gen'rous mind to guess.</p>
         <p>At all events, her outward mien,</p>
         <p>As it should be had always been,</p>
         <p>Nor had a jealous eye suspected</p>
         <p>Her duty had been e'er neglected.</p>
         <p>But as infirm he now was grown, }</p>
         <p>At her desire, he came to town }</p>
         <p>To seek Physicians of renown. }</p>
         <p>He first had one, he then had two,</p>
         <p>But their prescriptions did not do;</p>
         <p>When still her care prevail'd, and she</p>
         <p>Another sought, so he had three;</p>
         <p>And no more good seem'd to be done,</p>
         <p>Than if he had been seen by none.</p>
         <p>--Thus matters stood, nay he grew worse</p>
         <p>When an old busy, chattering nurse,</p>
         <p>Talk'd of the cures, almost divine,</p>
         <p>Of our friend Doctor ANODYNE.</p>
         <p>The drowning catch at any reed,</p>
         <p>And all is help in desp'rate need:</p>
         <p>Thus the rich man propos'd to try</p>
         <p>The boasted aid of Quackery,</p>
         <p>And what he wish'd, Amelia said,</p>
         <p>With anxious smile, must be obey'd.</p>
         <p>--Thus then it is, as we have seen,</p>
         <p>QUÆ GENUS has the attendant been;</p>
         <p>But now we are about to see</p>
         <p>What a snug _Proteus_ he can be.</p>
         <p>The Lady, to his great surprise,</p>
         <p>Oft view'd him with enquiring eyes,</p>
         <p>And did a kind attention show</p>
         <p>Which he thought queer she should bestow,</p>
         <p>But he soon found the matter out;</p>
         <p>Madam herself clear'd up the doubt,</p>
         <p>As, in her _Boudoir's_ still recess,</p>
         <p>She did her quiet thoughts express.</p>
         <p>In a soft, pleasant tone she spoke,</p>
         <p>As half in earnest half in joke;</p>
         <p>But as she thus her mind unveil'd,</p>
         <p>It might be seen what thought prevail'd.</p>
         <p>"There's something in your air and face }</p>
         <p>That tells me you will not disgrace }</p>
         <p>The trust which I now wish to place }</p>
         <p>In your obedience to my will;</p>
         <p>And if you do that trust fulfil,</p>
         <p>If you act up to my intent,</p>
         <p>QUÆ GENUS never shall repent."</p>
         <p>--His fingers on his lips he press'd,</p>
         <p>He clos'd his hands upon his breast;</p>
         <p>With most submissive air he bow'd,</p>
         <p>And secresy he swore and vow'd;</p>
         <p>When Madam _Woodlands_ thus proceeded:</p>
         <p>(I scarce need add that she succeeded.)</p>
         <p>"You do a Doctor's business ply;</p>
         <p>Now do not stare,--for so do I:</p>
         <p>There is a pale-fac'd patient too</p>
         <p>Whose certain cure I have in view,</p>
         <p>And I've a med'cine that will prove</p>
         <p>Specific,--as he's sick of love;</p>
         <p>It will, in time, set all at ease,</p>
         <p>And cure the pangs of his disease;</p>
         <p>For no prescription can be better</p>
         <p>Than that contain'd within this letter,</p>
         <p>Which you, my friend, must understand</p>
         <p>To give into the patient's hand.</p>
         <p>Believe me too, when you are told,</p>
         <p>You'll find it worth its weight in gold.</p>
         <p>--There is," she said, "a smile I see</p>
         <p>Now stealing on your gravity;</p>
         <p>But know, QUÆ GENUS I do nought</p>
         <p>That is with base dishonour fraught;</p>
         <p>My whims, though secret, common-sense</p>
         <p>Will clothe in garb of innocence."--</p>
         <p>In short, but not without a fee,</p>
         <p>He took the balmy recipe,</p>
         <p>And ev'ry time he bore a letter</p>
         <p>The patient's case was growing better.</p>
         <p>Thus fortune kindly did bestow</p>
         <p>Two strings to our keen Hero's bow;</p>
         <p>And to his wishes, in good troth,</p>
         <p>He reap'd no common gains from both.</p>
         <p>--But here, another lucky hour</p>
         <p>Did on his hopes new promise pour:</p>
         <p>For Madam _Woodlands_ more than hinted,</p>
         <p>If, in his present projects stinted,</p>
         <p>He should no longer wish to shine</p>
         <p>With Quackery and ANODYNE,</p>
         <p>He might, by her all-fav'ring grace,</p>
         <p>Attain her household's highest place.</p>
         <p>He saw, and not by way of whim,</p>
         <p>This was the very place for him;</p>
         <p>But still he felt he could not quit,</p>
         <p>As in a momentary fit,</p>
         <p>That state he to the Doctor ow'd,</p>
         <p>And which such benefit bestow'd;</p>
         <p>Then, without proper warning, leave him,</p>
         <p>Or with some scurvy tale deceive him,</p>
         <p>He saw in any point of view</p>
         <p>That honour prompts, it would not do.</p>
         <p>Thus, in a state of constant doubt,</p>
         <p>He scarce knew what he was about,</p>
         <p>And to the daily patients gave</p>
         <p>Their med'cines just as chance would have.</p>
         <p>To all diseases waiting there }</p>
         <p>He did not e'en appear to care }</p>
         <p>What was the complaint or where, }</p>
         <p>If it was fever or the gout;</p>
         <p>But left each dose to find it out.</p>
         <p>--Thus strange indeed, but it appear'd</p>
         <p>The healing shop would soon be clear'd,</p>
         <p>The patients calmly pass'd away; }</p>
         <p>Nay, some of them were rather gay, }</p>
         <p>And fees forsook th' impoverish'd day. }</p>
         <p>When this change our QUÆ GENUS saw,</p>
         <p>He thought awhile and felt an awe,</p>
         <p>When it struck sudden on his sense,</p>
         <p>That his so wicked negligence,</p>
         <p>Had caus'd, perhaps, the final doom</p>
         <p>Of many an inmate of the room;</p>
         <p>But, on a fearful search, he found,</p>
         <p>Not one of them was under ground,</p>
         <p>Nay, that by giving med'cines wrong,</p>
         <p>He did their precious lives prolong;</p>
         <p>At least no harm they had endur'd,</p>
         <p>For by his blund'ring they were cur'd.</p>
         <p>Shrewd ANODYNE, of course, suspected</p>
         <p>That his prime bus'ness was neglected;</p>
         <p>Indeed he clearly understood</p>
         <p>QUÆ GENUS did more harm than good,</p>
         <p>And therefore, without much delay,</p>
         <p>Hinted in a good-humour'd way,</p>
         <p>"You're tir'd, my friend, as it appears,</p>
         <p>(Of which I've sometime had my fears)</p>
         <p>You're tir'd of the _Galenic Art_;</p>
         <p>'Twere better, therefore, that we part."</p>
         <p>QUÆ GENUS made a calm reply,</p>
         <p>With acquiescing modesty:</p>
         <p>Nor was a harsh, unpleasant word</p>
         <p>From these dissolving Doctors, heard.</p>
         <p>In truth, each party was good-hearted;</p>
         <p>So they shook hands and thus they parted.</p>
         <p>Our _Proteus_ now is seen to grace</p>
         <p>Another and a favour'd place;</p>
         <p>The confidential servant he</p>
         <p>In 'Squire _Woodlands'_ family:</p>
         <p>But the poor 'Squire was hast'ning fast</p>
         <p>To that sad hour which prov'd his last;</p>
         <p>For soon, alas, the fatal gout</p>
         <p>Got in his head, and let life out;</p>
         <p>When Madam made a quick retreat</p>
         <p>From town to the fine country seat</p>
         <p>Which now was her's, with all the rest</p>
         <p>Of the great wealth which he possess'd.</p>
         <p>What tears the widow'd Lady shed</p>
         <p>In sorrow o'er her husband dead,</p>
         <p>Whether as they her cheeks bedew'd,</p>
         <p>They flow'd from grief or gratitude;</p>
         <p>How calm or poignant was her woe,</p>
         <p>We tell not, for we do not know.</p>
         <p>Yet this we can with safety tell,</p>
         <p>Because we surely know it well,</p>
         <p>That through her husband's sickly life</p>
         <p>She was a tender nurse and wife.</p>
         <p>--But now another scene appears,</p>
         <p>Dispers'd her grief, dried up her tears;</p>
         <p>Rich as she was and still a beauty,</p>
         <p>She look'd to change her line of duty;</p>
         <p>'Twas Nature's act, as all will see</p>
         <p>Who read her little history.</p>
         <p>In earlier years, ere she was led</p>
         <p>By Hymen to the marriage bed,</p>
         <p>VALCOUR and she each other lov'd,</p>
         <p>But their fond passion hopeless prov'd.</p>
         <p>--She was high-bred with fortune small,</p>
         <p>And his Commission was his all:</p>
         <p>For though he was of ancient line }</p>
         <p>And did with noble virtues shine, }</p>
         <p>He was the youngest child of nine; }</p>
         <p>And ere her marriage rites were o'er</p>
         <p>He sought renown on India's shore.</p>
         <p>What he thus bravely sought he found,</p>
         <p>And once more trod on British ground,</p>
         <p>With that, but little else beside,</p>
         <p>A month before Old Woodlands died.</p>
         <p>He let her hear that still he lov'd,</p>
         <p>She wrote, nor said she disapprov'd;</p>
         <p>That was the recipe to cure</p>
         <p>The doubts his bosom might endure;</p>
         <p>In which QUÆ GENUS was employ'd,</p>
         <p>And caus'd the good he now enjoy'd.</p>
         <p>--But then she acted with discretion;</p>
         <p>As her fond husband's sole possession</p>
         <p>She would not, at his last, allow</p>
         <p>The promise of a future vow:</p>
         <p>She felt her tender inclination,</p>
         <p>As a reversionary passion</p>
         <p>She must not own for him she lov'd,</p>
         <p>Till Death each hindrance had remov'd.</p>
         <p>For due decorum she obey'd,</p>
         <p>And the sage widow's period stay'd;</p>
         <p>Nor till Time pull'd the Hatchment down,</p>
         <p>Did she her _Valcour's_ wishes crown:</p>
         <p>But crown'd they were; a splendid show</p>
         <p>Did Fortune on the rites bestow,</p>
         <p>When Hymen call'd on Love to shower</p>
         <p>Its roses o'er the nuptial bower.</p>
         <p>QUÆ GENUS did the sports contrive</p>
         <p>Which kept the country-folk alive,</p>
         <p>And all the scatter'd bounties flow'd</p>
         <p>As his disposing hand bestow'd,</p>
         <p>Nor did one over-curious mind</p>
         <p>Suspect that any lurk'd behind.</p>
         <p>Nay, it was order'd to his care }</p>
         <p>The gen'ral figure to prepare }</p>
         <p>That was to blaze in Portman-Square. }</p>
         <p>He, who had sometime form'd the plan</p>
         <p>To set up for a _Gentleman_,</p>
         <p>Well knew the purse alone could aid</p>
         <p>The progress of that pretty trade,</p>
         <p>And now had learn'd, quite at his ease,</p>
         <p>To take the upper servant's fees,</p>
         <p>Which to fulfil his growing aim,</p>
         <p>In a resistless plenty came.</p>
         <p>--VALCOUR was grand, his _Eastern Taste_</p>
         <p>Was not dispos'd to run to waste;</p>
         <p>Madam had never yet made known</p>
         <p>Her beauty to th' admiring town,</p>
         <p>And ready wealth was now at hand</p>
         <p>Their mutual wishes to command:</p>
         <p>Plutus with Fashion standing by }</p>
         <p>Impatient languish'd to supply }</p>
         <p>Each wish of glowing luxury. }</p>
         <p>The tonish trade display'd its store</p>
         <p>Where our QUÆ GENUS kept the door;</p>
         <p>In various forms, a numerous host</p>
         <p>All strove who should affect him most,</p>
         <p>And by what tempting means engage,</p>
         <p>His trusty, promis'd patronage.</p>

         <p>Whene'er enquiry makes a stir</p>
         <p>To trace the human character,</p>
         <p>The strict and scrutinising eye</p>
         <p>Must look for human frailty,</p>
         <p>And will perceive as on we range,</p>
         <p>Our dispositions prone to change,</p>
         <p>Nor like the features of the face,</p>
         <p>Fix'd on their first-born, native place.</p>
         <p>So many tempting Sirens play</p>
         <p>Their games to lead the heart astray,</p>
         <p>So many gay temptations smile</p>
         <p>The wav'ring prudence to beguile;</p>
         <p>So many worldly interests wake</p>
         <p>The pliant feelings to forsake</p>
         <p>And wander from the beaten road</p>
         <p>In which they hitherto have trod;</p>
         <p>That reason from her judgement-seat</p>
         <p>Must, with a tender rigour, treat</p>
         <p>The venial errors of the mind,</p>
         <p>And in severity be kind.</p>
         <p>--Our Hero an example shews</p>
         <p>To ask the candour we propose,</p>
         <p>For he, we are compell'd to own,</p>
         <p>Had given his thoughts a different tone.</p>
         <p>As we have said, it was his plan</p>
         <p>To be a _future Gentleman_,</p>
         <p>And that he only could attain</p>
         <p>By seizing all the means to gain</p>
         <p>An added heap to that same store</p>
         <p>Which luck'ly he possess'd before.</p>
         <p>He, therefore, now had laid aside</p>
         <p>Those scruples which his boasted pride</p>
         <p>Maintain'd against the retail sense</p>
         <p>Of the shrewd _Grocer's_ eloquence,</p>
         <p>While, with Sir _Jeffery Gourmand_, he</p>
         <p>Preserv'd such pure fidelity.</p>
         <p>--And here it should not be forgot</p>
         <p>That it was _Molly's_ happy lot,</p>
         <p>By some keen plan which he had laid,</p>
         <p>To be the Lady's fav'rite maid:</p>
         <p>For _Molly_ he sincerely lov'd,</p>
         <p>And was with gen'rous passion mov'd;</p>
         <p>Nay, when his project he should carry,</p>
         <p>He had engag'd the maid to marry:</p>
         <p>Thus she was well prepar'd to join</p>
         <p>In forwarding the main design;</p>
         <p>Which as it may, perhaps, appear</p>
         <p>From the surmises hinted here,</p>
         <p>Was never, never to refuse</p>
         <p>What custom offer'd as their dues,</p>
         <p>And all the op'ning hand of chance</p>
         <p>Might gather from extravagance.</p>
         <p>How far this system may succeed</p>
         <p>Will soon be seen by those who read.</p>
         <p>This VALCOUR was a noble creature,</p>
         <p>Splendid and gen'rous in his nature;</p>
         <p>Nor had these feelings been decreas'd</p>
         <p>By the profusion of the East,</p>
         <p>Which he from well-earn'd station shar'd;</p>
         <p>But honour was his chief reward.</p>
         <p>He no amass'd Pagodas brought</p>
         <p>Whence treasures are so often sought:</p>
         <p>Yet he, the favour'd lot of few,</p>
         <p>As they bright fortune's track pursue,</p>
         <p>Though India gave him mod'rate store,</p>
         <p>Found plenteous wealth on Britain's shore.</p>
         <p>--Full many a well fought field he try'd,</p>
         <p>And MARS beheld his course with pride,</p>
         <p>Nay bade the wreath of triumph glow</p>
         <p>The Hero's pride, upon his brow,</p>
         <p>While Knighthood's pointed star express'd</p>
         <p>The tinsel glitter on his breast.</p>
         <p>But VENUS, who such things disposes</p>
         <p>Chang'd all the laurel into roses;</p>
         <p>And HYMEN did his state enfold</p>
         <p>In saffron mantle, rich with gold.</p>
         <p>As Nature in its fancies varies,</p>
         <p>Sir CHARLES indulg'd in his vagaries,</p>
         <p>With a wild love of shew and figure;</p>
         <p>Yet still he was resolv'd with rigour,</p>
         <p>A line of prudence to pursue</p>
         <p>And keep discretion in his view.</p>
         <p>Full droll indeed it may appear</p>
         <p>But thus he chose to persevere:</p>
         <p>Not to run out was all that he</p>
         <p>Consider'd as oeconomy;</p>
         <p>If his rents answer'd what he spent</p>
         <p>He'd bless his stars and be content;</p>
         <p>But never did his views appear</p>
         <p>To look upon the coming year.</p>
         <p>Nor e'er did he his mind distress</p>
         <p>To know if he could live on less:</p>
         <p>Nay at the thought how he would laugh,</p>
         <p>When told that he could live on half,</p>
         <p>And felt affront, if 'twere repeated</p>
         <p>That by his servants he was cheated.</p>
         <p>--Such a receipt to pamper ruin</p>
         <p>Nay to hurry an undoing,</p>
         <p>Has seldom given so queer a chance</p>
         <p>To gratify extravagance.</p>
         <p>--But so it was--QUÆ GENUS thought</p>
         <p>Just as the rising fancy taught:</p>
         <p>While, in mock fashion's borrow'd pride,</p>
         <p>MOLLY was seated by his side.</p>
         <p>Now as her needle made its way</p>
         <p>Some 'broider'd figure to display,</p>
         <p>Thinking, perhaps, how well her art</p>
         <p>Gave semblance to a two-fold heart;</p>
         <p>He fondly call'd her willing ear</p>
         <p>With all attention due to hear.</p>
         <p>QUÆ GENUS.</p>
         <p>"Plac'd as we are, it seems to be</p>
         <p>The height of that prosperity</p>
         <p>Which such as we can e'er enjoy;</p>
         <p>And it becomes us to employ</p>
         <p>The means it offers to possess</p>
         <p>Our views of future happiness.</p>
         <p>I doubt not, MOLLY, but you feel,</p>
         <p>For your sweet lady, all the zeal,</p>
         <p>Which flows alike from due regard</p>
         <p>As the just hope of due reward:</p>
         <p>But still, I think, it must appear</p>
         <p>That we've a doubtful course to steer;</p>
         <p>How we may keep within the line, }</p>
         <p>Our great folks' interest to combine }</p>
         <p>With what we know is yours and mine. }</p>
         <p>They are with generous grace endued,</p>
         <p>To us how kind they are and good.</p>
         <p>But life with them is nought but pleasure;</p>
         <p>Luxurious show fills up the measure</p>
         <p>Of all their hours, as they run on</p>
         <p>Through each meander of the Ton.</p>
         <p>They sometimes talk of prudent schemes,</p>
         <p>And reason's language veils the dreams;</p>
         <p>But the incessant love of change</p>
         <p>Invites the unreflecting range</p>
         <p>'Neath ev'ry dome where pride resorts</p>
         <p>And fashion holds her motley courts;</p>
         <p>Though while they for their pleasures roam</p>
         <p>We too well know their cost at home.</p>
         <p>This proud parade can never last,</p>
         <p>Their ready wealth will soon be past.</p>
         <p>--Nay, when I bring the month's account,</p>
         <p>And silent point to the amount;</p>
         <p>He tells my Lady what I've done,</p>
         <p>And she exclaims, ''tis precious fun!--</p>
         <p>We need not for our ruin fear</p>
         <p>With such a careful guardian near!'</p>
         <p>When I point out the triple charge</p>
         <p>In many a bill display'd at large,</p>
         <p>She says, 'QUÆ GENUS, do not grieve,</p>
         <p>Tradesmen, my honest friend, must live!</p>
         <p>Nay, when from service you retire,</p>
         <p>And sit all plodding by your fire</p>
         <p>In thought what profits should repay</p>
         <p>The labours of the closing day;--</p>
         <p>When o'er some door we see your name, }</p>
         <p>A dealer of great retail fame, }</p>
         <p>You have our leave to do the same.' }</p>
         <p>"I made my bow and answer'd nought,</p>
         <p>But then I paid it off in thought;</p>
         <p>And, as their gen'rous leave they give,</p>
         <p>Like others to play tricks and live,</p>
         <p>I may begin, perhaps, before</p>
         <p>My name is painted on the door;</p>
         <p>And, in good time, my fortune try</p>
         <p>With that same prosp'ring honesty.</p>
         <p>--I tell you, MOLLY, 'tis as clear</p>
         <p>As we, dear girl, are sitting here,</p>
         <p>That our great folks were both created</p>
         <p>So rich, please fortune, to be cheated.</p>
         <p>And we must aid them, as you see,</p>
         <p>Thus to fulfil their destiny.</p>
         <p>For trifles we'll not make a fuss,</p>
         <p>They will not be the worse for us:</p>
         <p>If we do not our pockets fill,</p>
         <p>Others there are who quickly will,</p>
         <p>But not by any paltry gains,</p>
         <p>As pilfering of _Sovereigns_.</p>
         <p>You must not crib a handsome shawl</p>
         <p>And say 'twas lost at such a ball;</p>
         <p>Nor will you in some corner place</p>
         <p>A card or roll of costly lace,</p>
         <p>That when you think she has forgot it,</p>
         <p>You to your own use may allot it:--</p>
         <p>Nor, when she gives a thrice-worn dress</p>
         <p>Your vanity and wish to bless,</p>
         <p>Do not within its wide folds smother,</p>
         <p>As if by chance, just such another,</p>
         <p>As she'd not miss it 'mid such plenty</p>
         <p>A wardrobe of full five-and-twenty,</p>
         <p>While others, 'mid the toilet's din</p>
         <p>Are almost daily pouring in.</p>
         <p>Can we such means as these pursue?--</p>
         <p>Would it be just in me and you:</p>
         <p>Though I guess by your waggish smile,</p>
         <p>What you are thinking of the while.</p>
         <p>But still I feel it is not right</p>
         <p>That you should lose your perquisite;</p>
         <p>Nor do I, my dear girl, incline</p>
         <p>E'er to forego the claim to mine,</p>
         <p>And tempting opportunity</p>
         <p>May tell us what those claims should be,</p>
         <p>As 'tis our right to seize the chance</p>
         <p>That's furnish'd by extravagance,</p>
         <p>When call'd upon to prove our taste</p>
         <p>In saving what would run to waste;</p>
         <p>For rumpled fin'ry, all thrown by,</p>
         <p>Is safer in our custody.</p>
         <p>--When t'other day the Knight bespoke</p>
         <p>A new great-coat and Hussar cloak;</p>
         <p>'Sure, Sir,' I said, 'you have forgot</p>
         <p>Of these same coverings what a lot,</p>
         <p>Neither be-spotted, scratch'd or torn</p>
         <p>And some of them have scarce been worn,</p>
         <p>Which are all hanging in the hall:'--</p>
         <p>'They're old,' he said, 'so take them all.'</p>
         <p>--I bow'd and took them to my keeping;</p>
         <p>Snug in my wardrobe they are sleeping.</p>
         <p>It is the same, I know it well,</p>
         <p>You of your Lady have to tell:</p>
         <p>I doubt not but your hoard encreases</p>
         <p>Of Spencers, mantles and pelisses:</p>
         <p>But let it be our mutual boast</p>
         <p>That sage precaution rules the roast;</p>
         <p>And take care that we never deal in</p>
         <p>Any thing that looks like stealing.</p>
         <p>My books are fair, accounts are right,</p>
         <p>In them my honour's sound and tight:</p>
         <p>Valet I am and Butler both,</p>
         <p>A rare advantage to our cloth,</p>
         <p>And there's no day, nay scarce an hour</p>
         <p>But tempting profits court my power,</p>
         <p>Yet may dread _Heaven_ above forsake me,</p>
         <p>And _Old Nick_ in his fury take me,</p>
         <p>If I the pilf'ring track pursue</p>
         <p>Which hireling knaves so often do.</p>
         <p>When from the shopmen we receive</p>
         <p>The somethings they are us'd to give</p>
         <p>As their long, bouncing bills are paid,</p>
         <p>'Tis not our Knight is tax'd, but trade,</p>
         <p>Though should we not our poundage claim</p>
         <p>_Sum Totals_ would be just the same.</p>
         <p>--E'en when, as if a boon, I crave</p>
         <p>Some superfluity to save,</p>
         <p>Perhaps he'll tell me I'm a fool,</p>
         <p>Or threat to floor me with a stool.</p>
         <p>--Last week, he said, 'at our next fête,</p>
         <p>(Mind what I say and hold your prate)</p>
         <p>Let the desert in splendour shine</p>
         <p>With gay plateaus and many a pine.'</p>
         <p>When as, to check the cost's encrease,</p>
         <p>I hinted what they were a piece,</p>
         <p>He ranted, 'if there are not _five_,</p>
         <p>Thou slave, I'll cut you up alive.</p>
         <p>Dare you look piteous? for then</p>
         <p>You scurvy clown, I'll order _ten_.'</p>
         <p>"These gay delusions cannot last,</p>
         <p>The spendthrift scene will soon be past;</p>
         <p>And, in another year or two</p>
         <p>You'll see that what I say is true.</p>
         <p>When Banker's checks, that easy pay</p>
         <p>Like fancy's ghosts have pass'd away,</p>
         <p>When the whole funded wealth is sold</p>
         <p>Another story will be told;</p>
         <p>When all the ready cash is flown,</p>
         <p>The country-rents will change their tone,</p>
         <p>Nor will the half-grown oaks supply</p>
         <p>The means for one year's luxury.</p>
         <p>Crabbed Entail will rise beside }</p>
         <p>And dare the acres to provide }</p>
         <p>The power to feed their needy pride, }</p>
         <p>And Mortgage-deeds in vain will strive</p>
         <p>To keep the piteous show alive.</p>
         <p>While thus the vain folk whom we serve,</p>
         <p>Do from each point of prudence swerve,</p>
         <p>While thus they waste in such a way,</p>
         <p>To Luxury the willing prey,</p>
         <p>I know, my girl, what I've to do,</p>
         <p>And faith, shall leave the rest to you!"</p>
         <p>MOLLY.</p>
         <p>"My dearest friend, you are so clever,</p>
         <p>That I could hear you talk for ever.</p>
         <p>Let not QUÆ GENUS be afraid,</p>
         <p>He ne'er shall want my ready aid;</p>
         <p>For surely to his heart 'tis known, }</p>
         <p>His ev'ry interest is my own, }</p>
         <p>At least I feel that we are one. }</p>
         <p>O yes, I comprehend him well!"</p>
         <p>But now she heard her Lady's bell,</p>
         <p>A summons that must be attended,--</p>
         <p>So here the conversation ended.</p>
         <p>Thus VALCOUR and his brilliant dame</p>
         <p>Attain'd their folly's highest aim,</p>
         <p>To scale the ladder of the Ton</p>
         <p>As many wealthy fools have done,</p>
         <p>And laugh, if they should hear the call,</p>
         <p>"Your foot may slip and you may fall."</p>
         <p>They did in every thing agree,</p>
         <p>With the same eye each object see.</p>
         <p>"Whate'er you fancy must appear</p>
         <p>So very right my dearest dear!--</p>
         <p>And whatsoe'er you do approve,</p>
         <p>Cannot be wrong, my sweetest love!"</p>
         <p>--Such was their billing and their cooing,</p>
         <p>As they were hast'ning on to ruin;</p>
         <p>Nor did they see that _Fashion_ laugh'd,</p>
         <p>While she their costly nectar quaff'd;</p>
         <p>Or 'mid the crowds that might attend</p>
         <p>Their banquets, they had not a friend.</p>
         <p>But such too often is the case</p>
         <p>Where Folly takes the highest place;</p>
         <p>And upstart fortune fain would be</p>
         <p>The ape of rank and family.</p>
         <p>There vulgar wealth pays dear for places</p>
         <p>With Lordships, Ladyships and Graces,</p>
         <p>Who at its table may appear }</p>
         <p>Or once or twice or thrice a year, }</p>
         <p>When luxury does the feast prepare; }</p>
         <p>And yet their host but coldly greet,</p>
         <p>If they should meet him in the street.</p>
         <p>--But true or not, howe'er that be,</p>
         <p>In this career of vanity,</p>
         <p>Winter's fine pleasures pass'd away</p>
         <p>And Summer made the country gay,</p>
         <p>While fashion now set out to grace</p>
         <p>The Country seat and Wat'ring place,</p>
         <p>VALCOUR and MADAME now were seen</p>
         <p>Parading on the Brighton Stein,</p>
         <p>But where, though envied and admir'd,</p>
         <p>With the same scenes they soon were tir'd:</p>
         <p>Besides 'twas decent to retreat</p>
         <p>And give life to their ancient seat.</p>
         <p>Thus while th' astonish'd Natives stare</p>
         <p>_Woodlands_ receiv'd the tonish pair;</p>
         <p>While they the rural 'Squires surprise }</p>
         <p>With splendid hospitalities; }</p>
         <p>And even here the money flies. }</p>
         <p>The Knight when sporting in the East,</p>
         <p>Was wont to hunt the brindled beast,</p>
         <p>Or the long, pointed jav'lin plant</p>
         <p>From castled back of elephant,</p>
         <p>In the fierce tiger's spotted side,</p>
         <p>And gloried when the savage died:</p>
         <p>He therefore would not deign to share</p>
         <p>The conquest o'er a tim'rous hare;</p>
         <p>Nor push on in a break-neck pace</p>
         <p>Through all his wiles the fox to chace.</p>
         <p>But when the sportsmen left their game,</p>
         <p>And weary to his mansion came,</p>
         <p>Which they were always glad to do,</p>
         <p>Whene'er that mansion was in view,</p>
         <p>QUÆ GENUS heard the orders gay</p>
         <p>To be fulfill'd without delay,</p>
         <p>As the loud and welcome brawl</p>
         <p>Re-echoed through the lofty hall,--</p>
         <p>"Prepare, that my good friends may dine,</p>
         <p>The turkey and the smoking chine,</p>
         <p>The pasty and whate'er is best</p>
         <p>To furnish out an instant feast!</p>
         <p>Be sure 'tis your attentive task, }</p>
         <p>To give them all that they may ask, }</p>
         <p>The bowl, the tankard and the flask;" }</p>
         <p>But then the Knight in whispers hinted,</p>
         <p>"When you perceive my time is stinted,</p>
         <p>And both my deafen'd ears no more</p>
         <p>Can bear the Bacchanalian roar;</p>
         <p>When it appears the stupid asses</p>
         <p>Scarce know the bottles from the glasses,</p>
         <p>Nor can perceive, 'mid boosing laughter,</p>
         <p>That I am only sipping water;</p>
         <p>When I shall unperceiv'd retire, }</p>
         <p>Remember it is my desire, }</p>
         <p>_They do not set the house on fire_." }</p>
         <p>--Thus, when o'erwhelm'd with sporting guest,</p>
         <p>Sir CHARLES his constant wish express'd,</p>
         <p>And, after many a vain essay,</p>
         <p>Contriv'd at last to steal away,</p>
         <p>With something like an aching head,</p>
         <p>To seek the refuge of his bed.</p>

         <p>QUÆ GENUS ATTENDS ON A SPORTING FINALE.]</p>
         <p>In drunken freaks QUÆ GENUS knew</p>
         <p>Sense was oft gone and feeling too;</p>
         <p>That legs might tables overturn,</p>
         <p>And fallen lights would flare and burn;</p>
         <p>Nay, flaming mischief might attend</p>
         <p>On lighted snuff and candle's end.</p>
         <p>Thus to be safe, without delay</p>
         <p>The threat'ning lights he bore away,</p>
         <p>And, to avoid a falling spark,</p>
         <p>Left parties snoring in the dark.</p>
         <p>Thus stretching as their limbs were able,</p>
         <p>On chair, on floor or on table,</p>
         <p>QUÆ GENUS did not own a fear</p>
         <p>That there was any danger near,</p>
         <p>So left them till the day should break</p>
         <p>And fev'rish nature bid them wake;</p>
         <p>When, yawning round the sporting closet,</p>
         <p>Some groom brought in their morning posset;</p>
         <p>And, hobbling off as they were able</p>
         <p>To mount their horses at the stable,</p>
         <p>They left the Knight their humble thanks,</p>
         <p>Hop'd Madam would excuse their pranks,</p>
         <p>And sought their homes, perhaps, to hear</p>
         <p>A wife talk loud in either ear.</p>
         <p>Such were the jovial sportsmen's meetings</p>
         <p>And these their hospitable greetings;</p>
         <p>But rural dames who were received</p>
         <p>With kindness while old _Woodlands_ liv'd,</p>
         <p>As they found such an alter'd state</p>
         <p>Ne'er enter'd twice the mansion gate:</p>
         <p>The 'Squires' wives would ne'er resort</p>
         <p>To one so chang'd to pay their court;</p>
         <p>And, though she was with title crown'd,</p>
         <p>The proud acquaintance they disown'd.</p>
         <p>Brimful of town conceits and folly,</p>
         <p>My Lady now grew melancholy;</p>
         <p>And when the sporting season came</p>
         <p>Her daily looks were not the same:</p>
         <p>That time of noisy, jovial joy,</p>
         <p>Did ev'ry lively sense annoy,</p>
         <p>Nor would she any reas'ning hear.--</p>
         <p>"To Town we'll haste away, My Dear!</p>
         <p>Let us be gone without delay:</p>
         <p>To London let us haste away!</p>
         <p>These rooms where staring figures sprawl</p>
         <p>In ancient hangings on the wall,</p>
         <p>Nay, where at noon, the shaded light</p>
         <p>Gives dimness of approaching night,</p>
         <p>Which nought can chearful make and gay,</p>
         <p>Or give the semblance bright of day,</p>
         <p>But that well-dress'd, high-minded glee</p>
         <p>That here, alas, we never see,</p>
         <p>Which could alone from this dull room,</p>
         <p>Snatch the grim likeness of a tomb!</p>
         <p>Let us be gone without delay,</p>
         <p>To London let us haste away!"</p>
         <p>--She gave a piteous look and sigh'd,</p>
         <p>When, with soft grace, Sir CHARLES replied.</p>
         <p>"As such is your desire, My Love,</p>
         <p>To Town we quickly will remove;</p>
         <p>If it will soothe my charmer's sorrow,</p>
         <p>We will set out for Town to-morrow.</p>
         <p>But have you thought, my dearest Dear,</p>
         <p>That not a creature will be there?</p>
         <p>Will you not find we shall be hurl'd</p>
         <p>Into a lifeless, empty world;</p>
         <p>Where, till the winter near approaches</p>
         <p>You will see nought but Hackney coaches?</p>
         <p>I'm sure you'll think yourself quite undone,</p>
         <p>If you're a month alone in London.</p>
         <p>To your gay spirit Oh how dull</p>
         <p>On a soft window-seat to loll,</p>
         <p>And count with your half-sleeping eye</p>
         <p>How many _Nobodies_ go by!</p>
         <p>While mothers with their babies tell,</p>
         <p>What sick'ning stuff they have to sell,</p>
         <p>When from their ceaseless screaming noises,</p>
         <p>You ask for what Heaven gave them voices:</p>
         <p>Till like the fiddler in a rage,</p>
         <p>Which you have seen in Hogarth's page,</p>
         <p>You stop your ears, with anger burn,</p>
         <p>And cry 'to _Woodlands_, let's return.'</p>
         <p>I'd rather sit and yawn, I own,</p>
         <p>Here in the country than in town,</p>
         <p>Where to dull club-rooms I must go, }</p>
         <p>E'en in the streets no creature know, }</p>
         <p>And ride alone in Rotten-Row. }</p>
         <p>But be it as you wish."--"Then I,"</p>
         <p>The Dame delay'd not to reply,</p>
         <p>"Desire such orders you will give</p>
         <p>That we, with prompt dispatch, may leave</p>
         <p>This stupid spot and hurry strait</p>
         <p>With post horse gallop through the gate,</p>
         <p>And when we've got a dozen mile,</p>
         <p>I then will thank you, Love, and smile.</p>
         <p>Yes, I will bid adieu to care, }</p>
         <p>Though not a soul in Portman-Square, }</p>
         <p>When once I see that I am there. }</p>
         <p>Believe me I would rather hear</p>
         <p>As sounds more pleasing to my ear,</p>
         <p>Fishwomen's cries along the street,</p>
         <p>Than noisy sportsmen when they meet,</p>
         <p>Whose noisy, vulgar, drunken brawl</p>
         <p>So often echoed in our Hall.</p>
         <p>The Town, perhaps, is not so full,</p>
         <p>But London never can be dull:</p>
         <p>Thin as it may be, or e'en thinner,</p>
         <p>We shall find folk to eat our dinner,</p>
         <p>And though no crowd will throng at present,</p>
         <p>Our little parties will be pleasant.</p>
         <p>The Drama too presents its play</p>
         <p>To make the evening pass away;</p>
         <p>Blue hills delight and lawns so green</p>
         <p>When they are painted on the scene;</p>
         <p>O how I like the woods and rocks</p>
         <p>When I can view them from a box!--</p>
         <p>I'm charm'd with such a rural sight</p>
         <p>When it is seen by candle-light.</p>
         <p>We shall to pass our time contrive,</p>
         <p>And keep our pretty selves alive,</p>
         <p>Till the world rolls to Town amain:--</p>
         <p>Then we shall be ourselves again."</p>
         <p>--They were themselves, and suffer'd pride</p>
         <p>Still to remain their fatal guide,</p>
         <p>And to bring on that period near,</p>
         <p>When Folly claim'd its full arrear.</p>
         <p>It is not needful for our rhyme</p>
         <p>To tell how long or short the time</p>
         <p>Which the vain Spendthrift Genius thought</p>
         <p>Was fit to bring their schemes to nought.</p>
         <p>All we shall say is, with the song,</p>
         <p>"The days of pleasure ne'er are long."</p>
         <p>And, if to proverbs we resort,</p>
         <p>"The days of sorrow ne'er are short."</p>
         <p>And here it is but truth to tell,</p>
         <p>That our QUÆ GENUS acted well.</p>
         <p>For never, as his duty call'd,</p>
         <p>When home affairs were so enthrall'd,</p>
         <p>That ere the Winter months would end</p>
         <p>There would be no more coin to spend,</p>
         <p>Nor credit found to give the swing</p>
         <p>To gay manoeuvres through the Spring,</p>
         <p>He did not from his master's ears</p>
         <p>Conceal the state of his affairs;</p>
         <p>And though, too oft receiv'd with scorn,</p>
         <p>Gave hints, but still they fail'd to warn.</p>
         <p>--At length, howe'er, the period came</p>
         <p>From fashion's list to blot their name;</p>
         <p>When it was vain for pride to look</p>
         <p>In the card-rack or porter's book,</p>
         <p>While the old guard might sit and snore,</p>
         <p>But rarely summon'd to the door;</p>
         <p>That door, of late, so seldom quiet</p>
         <p>From lounging call or pleasure's riot,</p>
         <p>Unless it, with less noisy stir,</p>
         <p>Announc'd some threat'ning visiter.</p>
         <p>--Encreasing wants began to press,</p>
         <p>And all things threaten'd that distress</p>
         <p>Which vanity knows not to bear, }</p>
         <p>That pride contemplates with despair, }</p>
         <p>Yet spurns regenerating care; }</p>
         <p>And a pale demon seems to see</p>
         <p>In form of sage oeconomy.</p>
         <p>The scene thus drawing to a close, }</p>
         <p>Friends, aye, and faithful ones arose, }</p>
         <p>With their best aid to interpose, }</p>
         <p>And VALCOUR found, when least expected,</p>
         <p>That falling he was not neglected.</p>
         <p>For he was lov'd by all who knew</p>
         <p>The virtues whence his follies grew;</p>
         <p>And some of these so active were</p>
         <p>As to preserve him from the snare</p>
         <p>Of Us'rer's gripe and Lawyer's strife,</p>
         <p>That seem'd to threat his future life.</p>
         <p>They did with counsel sage persuade</p>
         <p>And brought the ready, golden aid,</p>
         <p>Which check'd the powers that did enslave him,</p>
         <p>Before it was too late to save him.</p>
         <p>The well-weigh'd scheme which prudence chose</p>
         <p>Was rather an unsav'ry dose:</p>
         <p>Madam, at first, declar'd it treason;</p>
         <p>But humbled pride was taught to reason.</p>
         <p>Enough was spar'd to share the dance</p>
         <p>And gay festivities of France;</p>
         <p>With promise, when five years were o'er,</p>
         <p>They should regain the British shore;</p>
         <p>And, on repassing _Woodlands_ gate,</p>
         <p>Would find a noble, freed estate;</p>
         <p>And, from their follies past remov'd,</p>
         <p>Reside respected and belov'd.</p>
         <p>Now, all this serious bustle over,</p>
         <p>They sought, and soon set sail from, Dover,</p>
         <p>And, in the common period, found</p>
         <p>Their footsteps meas'ring Gallic ground.</p>
         <p>QUÆ GENUS saw them to the sea,</p>
         <p>Then gave a look of sympathy,</p>
         <p>And, with respectful rev'rence said,</p>
         <p>"When you again Old England tread,</p>
         <p>To re-enjoy my happy station</p>
         <p>I will quit any situation,</p>
         <p>And I dare boast you will receive me,</p>
         <p>As true and faithful as you leave me!"</p>
         <p>--To France he was not quite inclin'd,</p>
         <p>And MOLLY chose to stay behind;</p>
         <p>So both brush'd up their sep'rate graces,</p>
         <p>To go in search of _other places_.--</p>
         <p>For, 'twas not yet our Hero's plan</p>
         <p id="ca7">To set up for a GENTLEMAN.</p>
         <p>CANTO VII</p>
         <p>In the world's ever varying range</p>
         <p>There scarce can be a greater change</p>
         <p>Than from the hourly means of carving</p>
         <p>Without reserve, to hints of starving;</p>
         <p>From the men-cooks' superior waste</p>
         <p>To fireless kitchen's cold repast;</p>
         <p>From ham and fowl and beef and veal,</p>
         <p>To a lean shoulder's third day meal,</p>
         <p>From well-skimm'd broths, to greasy pot,--</p>
         <p>But this was now our Hero's lot:</p>
         <p>And here, perhaps, it may be fair</p>
         <p>To ask what chance could bring him there;</p>
         <p>For expectation sure might think</p>
         <p>That he would rather soar than sink,</p>
         <p>At least, he would his rank maintain</p>
         <p>Among High-Life's domestic train,</p>
         <p>And still display the priggish air,</p>
         <p>In some fine street or splendid square,</p>
         <p>Instead of opening the door</p>
         <p>In _Humbug-Buildings_, Number FOUR;</p>
         <p>Well known, as we shall shortly see,</p>
         <p>For weighty scenes of Usury.</p>
         <p>--How he this curious post obtain'd,</p>
         <p>Without reserve will be explain'd.</p>
         <p>My Lady VALCOUR, as 'tis known</p>
         <p>To hap sometimes to Dames of Ton,</p>
         <p>When sudden wants were set on edge</p>
         <p>Might look a precious stone to pledge,</p>
         <p>To raise a hasty sum or so</p>
         <p>She did not wish Sir CHARLES to know;</p>
         <p>For little systems of disguise }</p>
         <p>Are seldom seen to cause surprise }</p>
         <p>In the best order'd families. }</p>
         <p>MOLLY she fail'd not to employ</p>
         <p>In care of any glittering toy,</p>
         <p>Which might so very useful be</p>
         <p>In moments of necessity:</p>
         <p>But this strange, awkward kind of trade</p>
         <p>Was far from pleasant to the maid,</p>
         <p>As she, to 'scape from prying eyes</p>
         <p>Was told to change her air and size,</p>
         <p>And, to perform her work complete,</p>
         <p>To be a perfect counterfeit:</p>
         <p>In short, as was not uncommon,</p>
         <p>To make herself another woman.</p>
         <p>She therefore, thought it best to ask</p>
         <p>QUÆ GENUS to perform the task;</p>
         <p>And old John SQUEEZE was recommended,</p>
         <p>Who kindly to such wants attended:</p>
         <p>Though some who lov'd a joke to crack,</p>
         <p>Would laugh, and call him _Squeezing JACK_.</p>
         <p>In a snug corner of the town,</p>
         <p>To nameless spendthrifts too well known,</p>
         <p>The miser liv'd, if life it be</p>
         <p>Whose meat and drink was usury;</p>
         <p>For the old Hunx was ne'er content,</p>
         <p>Unless he gain'd his _Cent. per Cent._;</p>
         <p>And as all traffic with this Elf</p>
         <p>Was secret interchange of pelf,</p>
         <p>He fear'd not the rapacious paw</p>
         <p>Of daily violated law.--</p>
         <p>Diamonds that did 'mong ringlets blaze,</p>
         <p>And caught the night's admiring gaze;</p>
         <p>The necklace that from snowy neck</p>
         <p>Did in its cluster'd fashions break</p>
         <p>On swelling bosom, plac'd to share</p>
         <p>The beauty nature planted there;</p>
         <p>The rows of pearl that gave a charm</p>
         <p>To the round grace of taper arm:</p>
         <p>The bright drops which each sister ear</p>
         <p>Does with an equal splendour bear;</p>
         <p>And dazzling circles that are seen</p>
         <p>Of rubies red, of em'ralds green,</p>
         <p>And sapphires blue, whose blended rays</p>
         <p>The rainbow to the hand conveys,</p>
         <p>All these, at times, are forc'd to rest</p>
         <p>Within the miser's gloomy chest:</p>
         <p>In iron darkness there to wait</p>
         <p>A longer or a shorter date,</p>
         <p>Till gold's redeeming power shall say,</p>
         <p>Come and re-brighten on the day.</p>
         <p>On errands of this grave intent,</p>
         <p>QUÆ GENUS now and then was sent,</p>
         <p>And how he did his plans arrange,</p>
         <p>Or in what shape place the exchange;</p>
         <p>How he contriv'd these sly affairs,</p>
         <p>Paid soon, or lengthen'd the arrears,</p>
         <p>Of this we know not more nor less, }</p>
         <p>For we ne'er heard his tongue confess, }</p>
         <p>And 'twould be wasting time to guess. }</p>
         <p>But, somehow, he contriv'd to please,</p>
         <p>By grace or guile, old Master SQUEEZE,</p>
         <p>And by some strange, peculiar art,</p>
         <p>He gain'd upon the Us'rer's heart,</p>
         <p>If an heart such a being owns,</p>
         <p>Who chuckles when misfortune moans,</p>
         <p>At least, when that is understood</p>
         <p>To be a vessel fraught with good.</p>
         <p>But to proceed, the mind's keen eye</p>
         <p>Of _Squeezing Jack_, thought he could spy</p>
         <p>In our QUÆ GENUS that quick sense,</p>
         <p>Which might reward his confidence;</p>
         <p>That wary, penetrating thought,</p>
         <p>Which could not be too dearly bought,</p>
         <p>And in his present, sickly trim,</p>
         <p>Would be of golden use to him:</p>
         <p>For he grew old and wanted aid,</p>
         <p>In his nice calculating trade.</p>
         <p>In short, in every point of view, }</p>
         <p>As one who certain fancies knew, }</p>
         <p>The old man felt that he would do, }</p>
         <p>And that he could his interest make</p>
         <p>A station at the desk to take.</p>
         <p>Not the first time on business bent, }</p>
         <p>Though 'twas the last by MOLLY sent, }</p>
         <p>Our Hero to the office went, }</p>
         <p>With his redeeming coin to pay</p>
         <p>And fav'rite gems to bear away,</p>
         <p>He was desir'd to give an ear</p>
         <p>To the proposal he should hear,</p>
         <p>When _Squeezing John_ in cautious strain</p>
         <p>Did thus his secret wish explain.</p>
         <p>"--From what I know and all I see,</p>
         <p>You soon will be at liberty,</p>
         <p>The gentry to whom you belong</p>
         <p>Will not require your service long;</p>
         <p>And 'twould be well were you to take</p>
         <p>The offer which I now shall make:</p>
         <p>That is, as you already see,</p>
         <p>To come, my friend, and live with me.</p>
         <p>I hope no thought your mind engages,</p>
         <p>About such petty things as wages,</p>
         <p>I would not wish you to receive</p>
         <p>What common spendthrift masters give;</p>
         <p>I exercise a better way</p>
         <p>All such as serve me well to pay:</p>
         <p>Your bed and board will lib'ral be, }</p>
         <p>For you will live as well as me, }</p>
         <p>Such is my home oeconomy. }</p>
         <p>As for the service you will find</p>
         <p>Its profits fully to your mind;</p>
         <p>If you my interests understand,</p>
         <p>Your own will follow hand in hand;</p>
         <p>Nay, I my promise shall maintain,</p>
         <p>That you a pretty fortune gain.</p>
         <p>All I ask is, that you will be</p>
         <p>The pattern of fidelity,</p>
         <p>Which my observing eye has seen</p>
         <p>To others you have lately been;</p>
         <p>I have, my friend, but one word more,</p>
         <p>And then my speechifying's o'er:</p>
         <p>'Twill answer ev'ry purpose better</p>
         <p>And I shall hold myself your debtor,</p>
         <p>For reasons you shall plainly see,</p>
         <p>If you will wear your livery,</p>
         <p>For that can never be disgrace</p>
         <p>Which soon will gain superior place."</p>
         <p>QUÆ GENUS thought he could but try,</p>
         <p>If but from curiosity,</p>
         <p>Though some have said that then he view'd</p>
         <p>The future freaks that he pursued.</p>
         <p>Thus at the desk he soon was seated</p>
         <p>To learn how folly could be cheated,</p>
         <p>And to consent to play the rogue</p>
         <p>With any spendthrift vice in vogue,</p>
         <p>That did in pleasure's round perplex</p>
         <p>In any form, in either sex.</p>
         <p>The gains were great, nay almost certain,</p>
         <p>While pride so slyly drew the curtain,</p>
         <p>Indeed, it was so nicely clos'd,</p>
         <p>That the rich schemes were ne'er expos'd.</p>
         <p>--At first, a kind of gen'rous feeling,</p>
         <p>A sense of honourable dealing,</p>
         <p>Dispos'd him, with some doubts, to look</p>
         <p>Into the Broker's daily book,</p>
         <p>While he oft dipp'd his pen and thought,</p>
         <p>Ere he the huge per-centage wrote:</p>
         <p>Nay, he could pity the distress</p>
         <p>Which did upon their bosoms press,</p>
         <p>When, thus to pay for ill-bought pleasure,</p>
         <p>They yielded up their gayest treasure.</p>
         <p>--But then he mutter'd, "Where's the shame?</p>
         <p>Others, like us, would do the same:</p>
         <p>If we were now to shut up shop,</p>
         <p>Others into the place would pop;</p>
         <p>Extravagance would have its run</p>
         <p>And fools speed on to be undone.</p>
         <p>And their sad wants would be supplied, }</p>
         <p>If _John_ had laid his schemes aside, }</p>
         <p>Or had turn'd Methodist and died." }</p>
         <p>Thus interest to our Hero clung</p>
         <p>To stifle sense of right and wrong;</p>
         <p>And so at once he bade adieu</p>
         <p>To Conscience for a year or two:</p>
         <p>But, when attain'd the wish'd for store,</p>
         <p>It should resume its former power.</p>
         <p>Thus, at the opening of his trade,</p>
         <p>He a most curious bargain made</p>
         <p>With the Divinity within,</p>
         <p>To help him on through thick and thin.</p>

         <p>QUÆ GENUS IN THE SERVICE OF A MISER</p>
         <p>But now, a Fair One will appear,</p>
         <p>About her four-and-twentieth year;</p>
         <p>Though, whatsoe'er may be her age,</p>
         <p>She must be brought upon the stage,</p>
         <p>Blooming and gay and form'd to please,</p>
         <p>By the old man was call'd his niece,</p>
         <p>And, though there were some doubts we know,</p>
         <p>It turn'd out she was truly so.</p>
         <p>All saw that he was fond of Miss,</p>
         <p>Would often give and take a kiss,</p>
         <p>And even with his money part,</p>
         <p>To purchase smiles and make her smart.</p>
         <p>Abroad she was not us'd to roam</p>
         <p>But Novels read and stay'd at home.</p>
         <p>The pantry's boon, so lean and spare,</p>
         <p>Was forc'd on her unwilling care;</p>
         <p>For when Old Avarice complain'd</p>
         <p>Of the great cost his life sustain'd,</p>
         <p>He ne'er forgot, 'mong human ills,</p>
         <p>The baker's and the butcher's bills:</p>
         <p>But 'twas her interest to be</p>
         <p>The slave of his oeconomy.</p>
         <p>--An errand-man and one poor maid,</p>
         <p>Were all who gave the household aid:</p>
         <p>They were to am'rous purpose bent</p>
         <p>So fed on love and were content;</p>
         <p>And as QUÆ GENUS touch'd the _Money_,</p>
         <p>Which was his fount of _Milk_ and _Honey_;</p>
         <p>His easy stomach never car'd</p>
         <p>How lean the joint on which he far'd.</p>
         <p>--It was his interest to agree,</p>
         <p>In all things with Miss EMILY,</p>
         <p>As she could humour Uncle SQUEEZE,</p>
         <p>And now and then possess the keys:</p>
         <p>Nor could she shape her main design</p>
         <p>Unless QUÆ GENUS would combine</p>
         <p>The hobbling _Old One_ to deceive,</p>
         <p>And let in _Friends_ without his leave.</p>
         <p>She gave him physic, tuck'd his bed,</p>
         <p>The pillow smooth'd to rest his head;</p>
         <p>Then all around the curtains drew,</p>
         <p>And having spoke the night's adieu,</p>
         <p>Would gaily hasten down below</p>
         <p>To smile upon the favour'd beau</p>
         <p>Whom her commanding Billet-doux</p>
         <p>Had summon'd to an interview.</p>
         <p>From Uncle JOHN's great hoard of wealth,</p>
         <p>And the old man's declining health,</p>
         <p>'Twas thought she soon would be a prize</p>
         <p>Which smart young men might idolize;</p>
         <p>That a great fortune Miss would be</p>
         <p>From heirdom or by legacy:</p>
         <p>While lovers, therefore, not a few,</p>
         <p>Had pass'd before her in review,</p>
         <p>Her kind warm heart might not disown</p>
         <p>That she had fix'd her thoughts on one;</p>
         <p>And he it was who had the power</p>
         <p>To share with her an evening hour.</p>
         <p>But to the point, which even love</p>
         <p>Could not from her keen thoughts remove:</p>
         <p>The Lady did not long delay</p>
         <p>Thus the prime secret to convey,</p>
         <p>"I have a precious plan, QUÆ GENUS,</p>
         <p>And if 'tis manag'd well between us,</p>
         <p>We may, as I know how, contrive,</p>
         <p>To make our mutual int'rests thrive.</p>
         <p>I have already something done,</p>
         <p>As you will hear, for _Number ONE_,</p>
         <p>And there's another scheme will do,</p>
         <p>As you will know, for _Number TWO_.</p>
         <p>My uncle's wealth is that of _Croesus_,</p>
         <p>But how he'll leave it, Heaven bless us,</p>
         <p>I know not, nay, the trembling elf,</p>
         <p>May not as yet be sure himself;</p>
         <p>Though he, perhaps, may leave the whole</p>
         <p>To Charity, to save his soul.--</p>
         <p>Some folk have thought to make a will,</p>
         <p>Is signal given for Death to kill,</p>
         <p>But should he an intestate, die,</p>
         <p>The long expecting family,</p>
         <p>Will feed the greedy, gaping maw,</p>
         <p>Of griping, grinding, hungry Law.</p>
         <p>For though I am the next of kin,</p>
         <p>Such various claimants will rush in,</p>
         <p>Such troops of distant, country cousins,</p>
         <p>Will haste by scores, at least by dozens;</p>
         <p>So many Lawyers may appear,</p>
         <p>To promise each an ample share,</p>
         <p>That in what way these things may end,</p>
         <p>If fortune be my foe or friend,</p>
         <p>I wish, by all means, to ensure</p>
         <p>Some independent sinecure,</p>
         <p>And as you must the labour bear,</p>
         <p>You will a just advantage share.</p>
         <p>But not an atom of his wealth</p>
         <p>Must we attempt to take by stealth,</p>
         <p>No, though we could this night convey,</p>
         <p>As a sure, undiscover'd prey,</p>
         <p>His iron chest with all the gold</p>
         <p>And brilliant treasure it may hold.</p>
         <p>I only ask my views to aid</p>
         <p>But a small portion of his trade,</p>
         <p>And while above his riches flow,</p>
         <p>We may make mod'rate gains below,</p>
         <p>And what of that by us is done,</p>
         <p>Must be from funds which are our own."</p>
         <p>--The parties were at once agreed,</p>
         <p>And the scheme fail'd not to succeed:</p>
         <p>Nay, had stern fate the stroke delay'd,</p>
         <p>A decent fortune they had made;</p>
         <p>But as it was, their transient gain</p>
         <p>Gave them no reason to complain.</p>
         <p>--Now, ere twelve months or more were past,</p>
         <p>JOHN SQUEEZE, alas! had breath'd his last;</p>
         <p>And though they search'd the mansion round,</p>
         <p>A Will was no where to be found;</p>
         <p>And relatives in numbers came,</p>
         <p>Their rights to prove, their shares to claim;</p>
         <p>While the shrewd Miss AMELIA SQUEEZE</p>
         <p>Lock'd ev'ry box and kept the keys.</p>
         <p>--With angry threats the house resounded,</p>
         <p>It was confusion worse confounded;</p>
         <p>While she secure in prudent savings,</p>
         <p>Calmly beheld their idle ravings,</p>
         <p>As different ways they did pursue,</p>
         <p>Which diff'rent Lawyers bade them do.</p>
         <p>--And here we cannot overlook</p>
         <p>The wary way the lady took.</p>
         <p>Her favourite swain, it must be known,</p>
         <p>A Pleader was of some renown;</p>
         <p>To whom this offer she propos'd,</p>
         <p>With which the learned Lawyer clos'd.</p>
         <p>"If of the wealth of Old JOHN SQUEEZE,</p>
         <p>Of whom you know I am the Niece,</p>
         <p>You prove me to be lawful Heir,</p>
         <p>My charms and fortune you shall share."</p>
         <p>--Thus she was left amid the paws</p>
         <p>Of Lawyers and the tardy Laws,</p>
         <p>With chance that when ten years were past,</p>
         <p>A husband she might get at last.</p>
         <p>--Not as such union often ends,</p>
         <p>She and QUÆ GENUS parted friends:</p>
         <p>But ere Old SQUEEZE'EM was dispos'd,</p>
         <p>Ere the cold marble o'er him clos'd,</p>
         <p>Our Hero had a gracious tender</p>
         <p>From _JACOB LEVI, Money-Lender_.</p>
         <p>He, having had some kind of feeling</p>
         <p>With JOHN in his usurious dealing,</p>
         <p>Observ'd QUÆ GENUS, who had been</p>
         <p>Just such an useful go-between,</p>
         <p>As would find favour in the sight</p>
         <p>Of the keen, cautious Israelite,</p>
         <p>Who, therefore, with inviting grace,</p>
         <p>Offered him his vacant place.</p>
         <p>The proverb says it is a curse</p>
         <p>To go at once from bad to worse,</p>
         <p>And though, at first, he did not feel it,</p>
         <p>Time was determin'd to reveal it.</p>
         <p>--Of late, or more or less, 'tis true,</p>
         <p>Distress was in his frequent view,</p>
         <p>But then in its prevailing feature,</p>
         <p>It was but of a transient nature.</p>
         <p>A proud man for a whole week's date</p>
         <p>Might cease, perhaps, to eat off plate,</p>
         <p>Still, Dresden service could supply</p>
         <p>A varying scene of luxury:</p>
         <p>Or vanity might not resort</p>
         <p>To aid the splendour of a Court,</p>
         <p>From absent state of decoration,</p>
         <p>Required by certain rank and station:</p>
         <p>But, for a time, well-fram'd excuses</p>
         <p>Custom or fashion ne'er refuses;</p>
         <p>When soon again the plate is seen,</p>
         <p>The silver-smith has made it clean,</p>
         <p>And in a week, or month, or so,</p>
         <p>It will resume its usual show.</p>
         <p>Again the glitt'ring gems display</p>
         <p>At the gay Fête the dazzling ray,</p>
         <p>On having done the appointed duty</p>
         <p>To ease the wants of pride and beauty.</p>
         <p>But now another scene succeeds, }</p>
         <p>The pledge is turn'd from glitt'ring beads }</p>
         <p>To mortgages and title-deeds; }</p>
         <p>The short-liv'd search of ready-rhino</p>
         <p>By imps of Loo or of Cassino;</p>
         <p>Or to stop short a lawyer's threats,</p>
         <p>And dunning for a tradesman's debts;</p>
         <p>These yield to frightful views of ruin,</p>
         <p>Which threaten absolute undoing;</p>
         <p>That grasp at family estates</p>

         <p>QUÆ GENUS and THE MONEY-LENDERS.]</p>
         <p>QUÆ GENUS, was brimful of zeal</p>
         <p>To seize each turn of Fortune's wheel,</p>
         <p>And eager to fulfil his plan</p>
         <p>Of rising to a gentleman:</p>
         <p>But though gold roll'd beneath his eye,</p>
         <p>Though fees were paid and bribes were high,</p>
         <p>His heart, which had not lost its feeling,</p>
         <p>Shrunk from the base, remorseless dealing,</p>
         <p>That gloating avarice employ'd</p>
         <p>O'er the rich ruins it enjoy'd.</p>
         <p>While, therefore, some kind, gen'rous sense</p>
         <p>His heart felt of benevolence,</p>
         <p>And ere of honour quite bereft,</p>
         <p>He the rapacious LEVI left,</p>
         <p>In hope he might obtain a place</p>
         <p>He should not think as a disgrace;</p>
         <p>Nor of success had he to fear</p>
         <p>From VALCOUR'S written character;</p>
         <p>Where all his virtues were pourtray'd,</p>
         <p>In such a view that he was made</p>
         <p>In every domestic sense</p>
         <p>A paragon of excellence.</p>
         <p>But sad to tell, it was not long</p>
         <p>Before temptations, more than strong,</p>
         <p>Were urg'd by a kind, zealous friend,</p>
         <p>Who us'd on bus'ness to attend</p>
         <p>Old LEVI'S Levees: He display'd</p>
         <p>In artful whisper, the sure trade,</p>
         <p>Which, manag'd as he could define,</p>
         <p>Would shortly prove a golden mine.</p>
         <p>"Think not," he said, "that I am canting;</p>
         <p>Money, my friend, is all that's wanting.</p>
         <p>A certain sum could I command,</p>
         <p>I soon would purchase house and land.</p>
         <p>Ere a short time had onward run,</p>
         <p>I would strut forth a BUCK OF TON;</p>
         <p>The world, with its dull pride, defy,</p>
         <p>And jostle fools of quality."</p>
         <p>QUÆ GENUS felt his brooding plan</p>
         <p>To be a finish'd GENTLEMAN,</p>
         <p>At that same word his spirit started,</p>
         <p>And instantly he grew great hearted.</p>
         <p>"Your scheme," he said, "at once explain:</p>
         <p>If gainful, you shall share the gain."</p>
         <p>"But hear me out," it was replied,</p>
         <p>"And then you will be satisfied.</p>
         <p>Know, you must an assistant be</p>
         <p>At a club's gaming revelry.</p>
         <p>O check, I pray, your staring eyes,</p>
         <p>From looking on me with surprise;</p>
         <p>Let not the scheme I offer freeze you,</p>
         <p>Hear, and then do as it may please you!</p>
         <p>Think not I would your hand entice</p>
         <p>To deal the card or shake the dice;</p>
         <p>You must employ a knowing friend,</p>
         <p>And such a one I can commend;</p>
         <p>He's wary, and suspicion guards,</p>
         <p>By shrewdly managing his cards;</p>
         <p>Whate'er he does is done with ease,</p>
         <p>And heaps his gains by slow degrees,</p>
         <p>Till he has such a sum attain'd</p>
         <p>By which his object may be gain'd,</p>
         <p>Then one successful effort make,</p>
         <p>And seize a fortune in the stake.</p>
         <p>He watches those who love to drink,</p>
         <p>And sticks to such as cannot think:</p>
         <p>He turns his skilful inclination</p>
         <p>To young men who are prone to passion;</p>
         <p>He has cool words for those who're heated,</p>
         <p>Whose pride will not believe they're cheated;</p>
         <p>In short, he can a card entice,</p>
         <p>And fix good-fortune on the dice.</p>
         <p>With him you may your money trust;</p>
         <p>He will be generous as he's just:</p>
         <p>Proceed at once on manly ground</p>
         <p>And trust him with five hundred pound;</p>
         <p>With that, my friend, let him alone,</p>
         <p>He'll use it as it were his own."</p>
         <p>QUÆ GENUS enter'd on his place</p>
         <p>And acted with becoming grace;</p>
         <p>But with his keen, suspicious eye</p>
         <p>He saw what look'd like treachery,</p>
         <p>Which wak'd the fancy to be thrifty,</p>
         <p>So, of his pounds he gave but fifty.</p>
         <p>--On his official duties bound,</p>
         <p>He pac'd the hubbub-table round,</p>
         <p>And with attentive leering kenn'd</p>
         <p>His trusty, confidential friend,</p>
         <p>Whose frequent nods and silent grinning</p>
         <p>Full plainly told, he had been winning;</p>
         <p>But, when QUÆ GENUS ask'd th' amount,</p>
         <p>His friend thus settled the account.</p>
         <p>"It does my very heart-strings grieve</p>
         <p>That you have nothing to receive:</p>
         <p>Two hours ago my luck was crost,</p>
         <p>And then your fifty pounds were lost;</p>
         <p>For when with your advance I play'd</p>
         <p>Fortune became an arrant jade:</p>
         <p>Though since 'tis true that I have won,</p>
         <p>But then the risk was all my own;</p>
         <p>And, if you had but ventur'd more,</p>
         <p>Your purse might now be running o'er.</p>
         <p>With a round sum to-morrow night,</p>
         <p>Fortune may set all matters right:</p>
         <p>As 'tis in war, so 'tis with gold,</p>
         <p>She fails not to protect the bold."</p>
         <p>Our Hero was not such a _Flat_</p>
         <p>As to sit down content with that:</p>
         <p>He first determin'd to resist</p>
         <p>Or with a cudgel or a fist:</p>
         <p>But on reflection, felt an awe</p>
         <p>Of the grim, prosecuting law:</p>
         <p>Besides, had he enrag'd the room,</p>
         <p>It might have prov'd his final doom:</p>
         <p>Still he for vengeance inly cried</p>
         <p>And he was shortly satisfied.</p>
         <p>--The _Bow-street_ folk he happ'd to know</p>
         <p>Were walking that way to and fro,</p>
         <p>And when more closely on the watch,</p>
         <p>He mov'd the door's unwilling latch,</p>
         <p>The myrmidons rush'd rudely in,</p>
         <p>And all above was noise and din.</p>
         <p>Candles and lamps were all put out,</p>
         <p>When it became a mingled rout,</p>
         <p>While for the money on the table</p>
         <p>Each grasp'd as much as he was able;</p>
         <p>And our QUÆ GENUS had engross'd</p>
         <p>More than by _Humbug_ he had lost;</p>
         <p>Then nimbly made a safe retreat</p>
         <p>To lodgings in no distant street.</p>
         <p>Here, for some time he pac'd the room,</p>
         <p>To dissipate th' oppressive gloom</p>
         <p>That did upon his spirits light</p>
         <p>From the proceedings of the night.</p>
         <p>"Indeed," he said, "what then was done</p>
         <p>I do not wish to look upon,</p>
         <p>Nay I would from my mem'ry cast</p>
         <p>My curious ways for some time past,</p>
         <p>But certain, busy reasons tell</p>
         <p>Such effort is impossible.</p>
         <p>All therefore, that I now can do</p>
         <p>Is the forthcoming time to woo</p>
         <p>With those endearments which may prove</p>
         <p>QUÆ GENUS worthy of its love:</p>
         <p>With that just sense of what is right,</p>
         <p>That makes the moral lamp burn bright."</p>

         <p>QUÆ GENUS OFFICIATING AT A GAMING HOUSE.]</p>
         <p>Such pensive musings on him wrought</p>
         <p>Till he his welcome pillow sought,</p>
         <p>When, as absorb'd in sleep he lay,</p>
         <p>Fancy did on his spirits play,</p>
         <p>And in a strange and fearful dream</p>
         <p>A form did on his vision beam,</p>
         <p>With ghastly look as it were come</p>
         <p>From the pale confines of the tomb.</p>
         <p>He seem'd with one uplifted hand</p>
         <p>Instant attention to command,</p>
         <p>The other, as he solemn stood,</p>
         <p>Folded around the flowing shroud;</p>
         <p>And thus QUÆ GENUS seem'd to hear</p>
         <p>The hollow voice that pierc'd his ear.</p>

         <p>Who, in the earth, has long been laid, }</p>
         <p>And let his counsels be obey'd. }</p>

         <p>And is it thus you form the plan</p>
         <p>To vault into a Gentleman?</p>
         <p>SYNTAX thy memory must own</p>
         <p>As the sole parent thou hast known,</p>

         <p>From menace of an infant's grave.</p>
         <p>Better, perhaps, his fond regard</p>
         <p>Had not thy sad condition spar'd,</p>
         <p>If what of future life may last,</p>
         <p>Wakes no contrition for the past.</p>

         <p>The present means which you possess,</p>
         <p>If rightly us'd, will give success;</p>

         <p>Resist the world's seducing power,</p>
         <p>Or fear me at the midnight hour."</p>
         <p>--Thus as he thought the vision spake,</p>
         <p>The curtains round him seem'd to shake;</p>
         <p>And frowning, as in angry mood,</p>
         <p>At the bed's foot the figure stood,</p>
         <p>When, in a misty gleam of light,</p>
         <p>It seem'd to vanish from his sight.</p>
         <p>He woke in such an agitation</p>
         <p>His night-cap stream'd with perspiration;</p>
         <p>He started with a fearful stare,</p>
         <p>Not knowing if to pray or swear.</p>
         <p>He did from further sleep refrain</p>
         <p>As he perhaps should dream again,</p>
         <p>And Sommerden's departed Rector</p>
         <p>Might read another curtain-lecture.</p>
         <p>But when as through the shutter's crack</p>
         <p>He saw the beams of Phoebus break,</p>
         <p>Up he arose, the bell he rung,</p>
         <p>And, "Breakfast," issued from his tongue:</p>
         <p>The loud command was soon obey'd,</p>
         <p>And morning meal in order laid.</p>
         <p>On sofa stretch'd, he munch'd the toast,</p>
         <p>And sipp'd the Bohea, doubly dos'd</p>
         <p>With cordial drops, we won't say gin,</p>
         <p>Which he pour'd plentifully in,</p>
         <p>And did his trem'rous nerves redeem }</p>
         <p>By power of the reviving stream, }</p>
         <p>From the dire horrors of the dream. }</p>
         <p>--His spirits thus with strength recruited,</p>
         <p>He turn'd his mind to what was suited</p>
         <p>To the condition chance had bound him,</p>
         <p>And perils which might still surround him:</p>
         <p>Of his late playmates what became</p>
         <p>When power broke up the midnight game;</p>
         <p>And if pursued by any danger,</p>
         <p>To which as yet he was a stranger.</p>
         <p>But soon he found, enquiry made,</p>
         <p>The Bow-street spirits all were laid;</p>
         <p>Nor was it to the party known,</p>
         <p>By whom the mischief had been done.--</p>
         <p>Thus, from all legal threat secure,</p>
         <p>He felt determin'd to abjure</p>
         <p>The course of life he had pursued,</p>
         <p>Nor suffer knav'ry to delude</p>
         <p>His conduct into any plan</p>
         <p>That might disgrace a Gentleman;</p>
         <p>The character which his fond thought</p>
         <p>Had to a flatt'ring crisis brought,</p>
         <p>When he might try, and not in vain,</p>
         <p>The wish'd for honour to maintain.</p>
         <p>Besides, in favour of his scheme,</p>
         <p>He felt the warnings of the dream,</p>
         <p>As he their meaning understood</p>
         <p>Foreboded much of future good.</p>
         <p>At length his boasting fancies tired</p>
         <p>Of all to which his pride aspired;</p>
         <p>And, having nothing else to do,</p>
         <p>He sauntered forth to take a view</p>
         <p>Of what a saunter might present</p>
         <p>For serious thought or merriment;</p>
         <p>When, as he careless stroll'd along,</p>
         <p>Half-humming some new-fangled song,</p>
         <p>He heard a voice that did proclaim</p>
         <p>His own but too familiar name.</p>
         <p>'Twas Mr. CARMINE, who was known</p>
         <p>An artist of the first renown</p>
         <p>For portraiture of living faces,</p>
         <p>Whose pencil gave and heighten'd graces,</p>
         <p>Who, 'mid the hurry of the street,</p>
         <p>Did sauntering QUÆ GENUS greet:</p>
         <p>When, having sought a place of quiet,</p>
         <p>Free from the passing, bustling riot,</p>
         <p>In civil tones the man of art</p>
         <p>Began his Queries to impart.</p>
         <p>"Your family, I hope, are well,</p>
         <p>And will you Lady VALCOUR tell,</p>
         <p>If it so please her you may come</p>
         <p>And fetch her fine resemblance home:</p>
         <p>Nay she may have forgot, I fear,</p>
         <p>That the last sitting's in arrear:</p>
         <p>Give but the hint as I demand</p>
         <p>And you shall feel my grateful hand."</p>
         <p>--QUÆ GENUS hasten'd to reply</p>
         <p>With the gay VALCOURS' history,</p>
         <p>And fear'd that, for a year or two,</p>
         <p>The picture must _in statu quo_</p>
         <p>Within his gallery remain,</p>
         <p>At least, till they came home again.</p>
         <p>"Well then," said CARMINE, "tell me friend,</p>
         <p>What fortunes on your steps attend."</p>
         <p>"Sir," he replied, "'tis Fortune's pleasure</p>
         <p>I should enjoy a state of leisure.</p>
         <p>Sir CHARLES, so generous and kind,</p>
         <p>Wish'd not that I should stay behind,</p>
         <p>Nay, would have paid me high to go,</p>
         <p>As I've a paper that will shew:</p>
         <p>But certain schemes play'd on my brain</p>
         <p>Which fix'd my purpose to remain,</p>
         <p>And yet, with all my honest care,</p>
         <p>I have not brought one scheme to bear."</p>
         <p>"My friend," the artist said, "if you</p>
         <p>Have not a better scheme in view,</p>
         <p>My place, unless I greatly err,</p>
         <p>Would suit your turn and character</p>
         <p>'Tis but to know and to make known</p>

         <p>Take care you manage well your tongue</p>
         <p>To please the old as well as young,</p>
         <p>And study the expressive grace</p>
         <p>That's seen to beam on any face;</p>
         <p>When, in fair words and cautious mood</p>
         <p>You may mark the similitude</p>

         <p>Nor to the sex your hints confine,</p>
         <p>The ermin'd sage and grave divine,</p>

         <p>From Misses, Beaux, Old Dames and Sages,</p>
         <p>You'll gain, Good Fellow, three-fold wages.</p>
         <p>--Now turn the offer in your mind,</p>
         <p>And, if your prudence is inclin'd</p>
         <p>To take it, you will let me know</p>
         <p>To-morrow how your wishes flow."</p>

         <p>As in an artist's gallery?</p>
         <p>For while he look'd at forms and faces</p>
         <p>He might learn all the tonish graces,</p>
         <p>Whatever manners could bestow, }</p>
         <p>What attitudes were best to show; }</p>
         <p>In short, all that he sought to know. }</p>
         <p>For the fine folk who visit there</p>
         <p>Come deck'd with all becoming care,</p>
         <p>That the chaste pencil may not err</p>
         <p>From truth of form and character,</p>
         <p>Which not alone, while yet they live,</p>
         <p>The canvas may be proud to give,</p>
         <p>But offer to the admiring eye</p>
         <p>Of an unborn posterity!</p>
         <p>"O," he exclaim'd, "this is the plan, }</p>
         <p>I all its various merits scan, }</p>
         <p>'Tis HALF-WAY to a _Gentleman_!" }</p>
         <p>--Nay, to be brief, the following day</p>
         <p>Beheld him all in due array,</p>
         <p>And soon alert, submissive, smart, }</p>
         <p>Well vers'd in all the slang of art; }</p>
         <p>He to perfection play'd his part. }</p>
         <p>In mildest tone would just express</p>
         <p>The charms a canvas may possess,</p>
         <p>Where Loves and Graces seem to smile</p>
         <p>And do th' enchanted eye beguile.</p>
         <p>Though still he ne'er forgot his duty</p>
         <p>To one who might have been a beauty,</p>
         <p>There he did not throw out his hints</p>
         <p>Of charming smiles and rosy tints,</p>
         <p>But to her portrait would refer</p>
         <p>For force and grace of character.</p>
         <p>Still his own thoughts ne'er went astray, }</p>
         <p>He rather told what others say, }</p>
         <p>What my Lord B. prais'd yesterday. }</p>
         <p>Thus he contriv'd, it seems, to please</p>
         <p>CARMINE's fine folk, of all degrees,</p>
         <p>And what he gain'd, he now might say,</p>
         <p>He got it in an honest way.</p>
         <p>From all he did the Artist thought</p>
         <p>He had a real treasure got;</p>
         <p>Nor had QUÆ GENUS any cause</p>
         <p>To grumble at domestic laws;</p>
         <p>For all who serv'd them were content</p>
         <p>With the well-rang'd establishment.</p>
         <p>Above, was all that taste could show,</p>
         <p>And ease and comfort reign'd below;</p>
         <p>For CARMINE sought not cost to spare,</p>
         <p>And splendid plenty revell'd there.</p>
         <p>--O Discretion, what thy powers,</p>
         <p>To watch o'er life's fantastic hours,</p>
         <p>To check warm nature's glowing heat</p>
         <p>When passions in the bosom beat,</p>
         <p>And whim and fancy's busy train</p>
         <p>Play their vagaries through the brain!</p>
         <p>But that comptroller of the will,</p>
         <p>That sober judge 'tween good and ill,</p>
         <p>Or from his folly or his pride</p>
         <p>QUÆ GENUS seem'd to throw aside.</p>
         <p>This was the spot where he might stay, }</p>
         <p>Where duty was improving play, }</p>
         <p>Till hope should paint the wish'd-for way. }</p>
         <p>But whimsies did his wits employ</p>
         <p>The play-game of an idle boy,</p>
         <p>For which if, at his earliest school,</p>
         <p>Thus he had dared to play the fool,</p>
         <p>He would have felt the smarting fate</p>
         <p>That does on thoughtless culprit wait.</p>
         <p>--The easy, morning duties done,</p>
         <p>The after-day was all his own,</p>
         <p>When, as it surely may be thought</p>
         <p>He might have some improvement sought:</p>
         <p>But no, his genius seem'd to chuse</p>
         <p>His luckless leisure to amuse,</p>
         <p>In changing, when brimfull of glee,</p>
         <p>The system of the Gallery;</p>
         <p>Would make the pictures change their places,</p>
         <p>And with his chalk deform their faces,</p>
         <p>(For, from a boy, whate'er he saw,</p>
         <p>With a rude outline, he could draw,)</p>
         <p>Turn down the portraits in their frames,</p>
         <p>And look and laugh and call them names.</p>
         <p>Though if no other harm were done,</p>
         <p>Unknown he might have had his fun:</p>
         <p>But hence the mischief did ensue,</p>
         <p>The names he call'd were written too:</p>
         <p>In short, he turn'd the painter's school</p>
         <p>Completely into ridicule,</p>
         <p>And, by a TITLE or a SCROLL,</p>
         <p>He strove to stigmatize the whole.</p>
         <p>--He would a _Lawn-rob'd Prelate_ place</p>
         <p>As if he ogled _Cælia's_ face,</p>
         <p>Exclaiming "There's no greater bliss,</p>
         <p>No, not in Heaven, than _Cælia's Kiss_;"</p>
         <p>While _Cælia_ might be made to say</p>
         <p>"_Hands off, my pious Lord, I pray!</p>
         <p>Remember what you ought to feel--</p>
         <p>The good book says you must not steal;</p>
         <p>And steal you will, if you receive it,</p>
         <p>For hang me, FUSTY, if I give it_."</p>
         <p>--He then, perhaps, would run his rig,</p>
         <p>With _Cap and Bells_ on _Judge's Wig_;</p>
         <p>When thus his fancy might indite,</p>
         <p>And in a well turn'd label write,--</p>
         <p>"_Now should MY LORD be in a fury,</p>
         <p>And shake that WIG_, he'd fright the JURY_."</p>
         <p>--The portrait of an AGED DAME</p>
         <p>Might have this added to her name,--</p>
         <p>"_Your Crutch-stick tells you scarce can walk,</p>
         <p>But still you bore all ears with talk;</p>
         <p>A most incorrigible Hag,</p>
         <p>Who nothing but your TONGUE can wag_."</p>
         <p>--A MARRIED PAIR together plac'd,</p>
         <p>And with their household emblems grac'd,</p>
         <p>Though looking in each other's faces,</p>
         <p>He would remove to sep'rate places,</p>
         <p>And then contrive to make them say,</p>
         <p>"_How shall we, Sir, this act repay?</p>
         <p>Our Home Cabals we now shall smother,</p>
         <p>At this nice distance from each other;</p>
         <p>Thus far removed we shall agree,--</p>
         <p>'Tis just as we both wish to be._"</p>
         <p>--A LORD MAYOR's brow he would adorn</p>
         <p>With honours of a double Horn;</p>
         <p>Then from a long scroll make him cry,</p>
         <p>"_Make room for Cuckolds, here comes I_."</p>
         <p>--A LAWYER, clad in wig and band,</p>
         <p>With briefs and papers in his hand,</p>
         <p>QUÆ GENUS would contrive to trace</p>
         <p>A JANUS with a _Double Face_,</p>
         <p>And each face with a ready tongue</p>
         <p>To plead the cause or right or wrong,</p>
         <p>Exclaiming in both scrolls--"_'Tis We,</p>
         <p>And waiting for a Double Fee_."</p>
         <p>Such was his wit, which sometimes told</p>
         <p>Its thoughts in flashes far too bold:</p>
         <p>Which the Muse knows would not be meet</p>
         <p>For her Chaste Spirit to repeat.</p>
         <p>--Thus when the Monkey's hand had done</p>
         <p>With this display of idle fun,</p>
         <p>And in his vacant hour of sense</p>
         <p>Had triumph'd in Impertinence;</p>
         <p>He would repair his saucy tricks,</p>
         <p>The pictures in their places fix,</p>
         <p>Wipe out the mischief of the chalk</p>
         <p>And bid the portraits cease to talk;</p>
         <p>Then with a military air,</p>
         <p>Aloud command them--"AS YOU WERE."--</p>
         <p>--Now it, at least, was once a week,</p>
         <p>He did this gay amusement seek,</p>
         <p>When CARMINE'S absence gave the power</p>
         <p>Thus to pass off his leisure hour,</p>
         <p>As different faces might present</p>
         <p>Fresh subjects for his merriment.</p>
         <p>But those foul imps who oft molest,</p>
         <p>With awkward thoughts, the human breast,</p>
         <p>(As the expression's not so civil,</p>
         <p>We will not hint it is the devil,)</p>
         <p>Will, as their trade is to deceive,</p>
         <p>Fast in the lurch their vot'ries leave;</p>
         <p>And soon QUÆ GENUS was betray'd</p>
         <p>Into the trap his folly laid.</p>
         <p>One vernal eve, he had o'erflow'd</p>
         <p>With chalk and chatter ill-bestow'd,</p>
         <p>When call'd off for we know not what,</p>
         <p>The unfinish'd mischief was forgot;</p>
         <p>And in the morning, ere the clout</p>
         <p>Had duly wip'd his folly out,</p>
         <p>A party, who from town were going,</p>
         <p>Came, just to pay what might be owing:</p>
         <p>At the same time to represent</p>
         <p>Where all their portraits might be sent.</p>
         <p>--One _Elder Lady_ rubb'd her eyes,</p>
         <p>With equal anger and surprize,</p>
         <p>While she could scarce believe she read,</p>
         <p>The _Witch_ of _Endor_ o'er her head.</p>
         <p>--Another, not of younger age,</p>
         <p>Could not restrain her glowing rage,</p>
         <p>When _Mother RED CAP_ was the name</p>
         <p>Which chalk had given to the Dame;</p>
         <p>And then she scream'd aloud,--"_Forsooth,</p>
         <p>A Pipe is put into my mouth,</p>
         <p>Whose nauseous fumes around me fly</p>
         <p>To stamp me with vulgarity_!"</p>
         <p>--With them there was a sweet young lady,</p>
         <p>In beauty's bloom and vernal gay day;</p>
         <p>Her portrait in all stature stood,</p>
         <p>With all the grace of attitude,</p>
         <p>And charms to turn, though not of stone,</p>
         <p>A _Carmine_ to _Pygmalion_.</p>
         <p>But she, in all her beauty's pride,</p>
         <p>A _Wheel-barrow_ was made to guide,</p>
         <p>While ruby lips were seen to cry,</p>
         <p>"_Sheep's hearts for those who want to buy_!"</p>
         <p>The marble urn which stood behind her,</p>
         <p>Was turn'd into a rude _Knife-Grinder_,</p>
         <p>And at no very far approach</p>
         <p>Was seen a passing _Hackney Coach_,</p>
         <p>While all the lawns and groves so sweet</p>
         <p>Were scrawl'd into a _London Street_.</p>
         <p>--Anger in diff'rent tones were heard,</p>
         <p>And when CARMINE in haste appear'd,</p>
         <p>Aghast he stood, then vengeance vow'd,</p>
         <p>Declar'd his innocence--and bow'd;</p>
         <p>But in a few short minutes prov'd</p>
         <p>The wicked lines might be remov'd.</p>
         <p>If water is not just at hand,</p>
         <p>_Saliva's_ always at command,</p>
         <p>Which gives the tints a brighter glow,</p>
         <p>And leaves a kind of varnish too.</p>
         <p>This, with his handkerchief applied,</p>
         <p>Soon wip'd the saucy chalk aside.</p>
         <p>The Dame exclaim'd,--"_Pray look, d'ye see,</p>
         <p>Still more affronts, my Lady B----:</p>
         <p>This is the height of all disgrace,</p>
         <p>The Painter's spitting in my face_."</p>
         <p>CARMINE, without a word, went on,</p>
         <p>And when his cleansing skill was shown,</p>
         <p>When witticisms disappear'd,</p>
         <p>And each offending line was clear'd,</p>
         <p>The sudden change appear'd to please,</p>
         <p>And angry words began to cease.</p>
         <p>But still he thought he ought to show</p>
         <p>The threat'ning terms he could bestow.</p>
         <p>The maids, each answ'ring to her name,</p>
         <p>Aloud their innocence proclaim:</p>
         <p>The housekeeper and sturdy cook</p>
         <p>Propose to swear on HOLY BOOK,</p>
         <p>They could not do it:--Heaven forbid it!</p>
         <p>And then they told,--QUÆ GENUS _did it_:</p>
         <p>On which, the solemn Dames insist</p>
         <p>Such Impudence should be dismiss'd.</p>
         <p>But though they saw the alter'd show }</p>
         <p>Restor'd to all its pristine glow, }</p>
         <p>They let th' astonish'd artist know }</p>
         <p>Th' insulted portraits should not stay</p>
         <p>Where they then were another day.</p>
         <p>Thus porters, order'd to the door, }</p>
         <p>Away each fine resemblance bore, }</p>
         <p>That they might be defac'd no more.-- }</p>
         <p>--The Dames departed in a huff,</p>
         <p>With _fanning_ cool'd,--consol'd with _snuff_:</p>
         <p>While Miss, beneath her bonnet's poke,</p>
         <p>Smil'd as if _she_ enjoy'd the joke.</p>
         <p>Our Hero now was seen to wait</p>
         <p>The threat'nings of impending fate:</p>
         <p>That fate, but in the mildest tone,</p>
         <p>CARMINE delay'd not to make known.</p>
         <p>"As you vie with me in my art,</p>
         <p>'Tis clear, my friend, that we must part:</p>
         <p>Your genius is so full of sport</p>
         <p>That you must go,--I'm sorry for't!</p>
         <p>Such tricks will bring, as you must see,</p>
         <p>Disgrace upon the Gallery;</p>
         <p>Indeed, by your confounded fun,</p>
         <p>Mischief may be already done!</p>
         <p>You talk'd of schemes when you came here,</p>
         <p>But, faith, this scheme may cost me dear.</p>
         <p>As tricks like these you chuse to play,</p>
         <p>'Twere well that you should march away;</p>
         <p>So go, where, spite of common sense,</p>
         <p>Your jokes may pass without offence.</p>
         <p>Few words are best,--my mind to tell:</p>
         <p>Pack up your Chalk,--and so farewell!"</p>
         <p>--QUÆ GENUS the command obey'd,</p>
         <p>As pleas'd to go as if he stay'd.</p>
         <p>Here then his _final Service_ ends:--</p>
         <p id="ca8">But MAN and MASTER parted friends.</p>
         <p>CANTO VIII</p>
         <p>Life, as a witty Bard has shewn,</p>
         <p>Who dealt in just comparison,[1]</p>
         <p>Is but a busy pantomime,</p>
         <p>Whose actions vary with the time;</p>
         <p>Where they who turn from side to side,</p>
         <p>According to the wind and tide,</p>
         <p>Are more ingenious in their art</p>
         <p>Than such as act but one grave part;</p>
         <p>Who, as their years pass onward, seem</p>
         <p>To glide along one gentle stream.</p>
         <p>But here we stop not to contend</p>
         <p>Whether, to answer Life's great end,</p>
         <p>'Tis best from place to place to range,</p>
         <p>Or fix to one, and never change.</p>
         <p>Suffice it, that, from choice or chance,</p>
         <p>QUÆ GENUS hurried through some dance</p>
         <p>Of early life, and, as we see,</p>
         <p>Not knowing what the next would be:</p>
         <p>But now, disdaining future tricks,</p>
         <p>He felt a firm resolve to fix</p>
         <p>Upon a steady, better plan,</p>
         <p>Of living like a _Gentleman_.</p>
         <p>Whether he knew to calculate</p>
         <p>The means required for such a state,</p>
         <p>The curious eye will shortly see,</p>
         <p>In his approaching History.</p>
         <p>[1] BUTLER, the Author of HUDIBRAS.</p>
         <p>It has been well observ'd by some,</p>
         <p>"All countries are a wise man's home."</p>
         <p>As it is said of diff'rent nations,</p>
         <p>The same is true of various stations</p>
         <p>Which man is destin'd to fulfil,</p>
         <p>Or with, or e'en against his will;</p>
         <p>If Reason happens to provide</p>
         <p>A steersman who is fit to guide</p>
         <p>The vessel o'er life's flowing main,</p>
         <p>And sure at last the port to gain.</p>
         <p>How much our Hero had amass'd,</p>
         <p>By ways and means now gone and pass'd,</p>
         <p>We know not, as we never heard</p>
         <p>The hoarded sums he had prepar'd;</p>
         <p>But as he had a sense of craving,</p>
         <p>And with it, too, a knack of saving,</p>
         <p>He must have got a heap of Cash,</p>
         <p>Which, for a time, would make a dash.</p>
         <p>The _Valcour_ wardrobe almost new, }</p>
         <p>The gifts of service, laid _perdu_, }</p>
         <p>Would serve him for a year or two; }</p>
         <p>And by some _Snip's_ contriving art,</p>
         <p>Would fit him well and make him smart:</p>
         <p>But stumbling-blocks were found to lay</p>
         <p>Before him, and impede his way.</p>
         <p>Manners and matter he possest,</p>
         <p>His early life had given the best;</p>
         <p>And while he as a servant mov'd,</p>
         <p>His knowledge of the world improv'd:</p>
         <p>But still his face and form were known</p>
         <p>In certain quarters of the town,</p>
         <p>And the first object to his fame</p>
         <p>Was to discard his present name;</p>
         <p>For he ne'er did a Father know,</p>
         <p>The source from whence a name should flow;</p>
         <p>And by QUÆ GENUS nought was meant--</p>
         <p>It was a boon by accident,</p>
         <p>Which he might, if he pleas'd, disuse,</p>
         <p>And any other title chuse.</p>
         <p>Through the _Directory_ he waded,</p>
         <p>Till his poor eyes were sadly jaded;</p>
         <p>Then in the finer streets he stroll'd</p>
         <p>Where Names on _Door Plates_ are enroll'd:</p>
         <p>But then he fear'd a name to own,</p>
         <p>Which would, perhaps, be too well known,</p>
         <p>And cause enquiries, that might be</p>
         <p>The source of some perplexity.</p>
         <p>Reason, at length, rous'd the intention</p>
         <p>Of yielding to his own invention,</p>
         <p>To eke out from the alphabet,</p>
         <p>A name he never heard of yet;</p>
         <p>And which his fancy might suggest</p>
         <p>As one to suit his project best.</p>
         <p>FREE-BORN he thought would do as well</p>
         <p>As any other he could tell,</p>
         <p>When, his right Christian name of JOHN</p>
         <p>Form'd the becoming union;</p>
         <p>Then nothing more he could desire</p>
         <p>Than trim these names with an ESQUIRE;</p>
         <p>And to let the report be spread,</p>
         <p>That some rich relative was dead,</p>
         <p>And 'twas his Fortune and his Fate</p>
         <p>To get the name and an estate.</p>
         <p>Should it be ask'd where _that_ might lay,</p>
         <p>He had prepar'd himself to say,</p>
         <p>(As if half earnest--half in joke,</p>
         <p>The smiling answer might be spoke,)</p>
         <p>"'Tis here, 'tis there, 'tis everywhere,</p>
         <p>Or in some country in the air;</p>
         <p>But should you come to _number three_</p>
         <p>In such a street, you there will see</p>
         <p>How that estate appears to thrive:</p>
         <p>On _Thursday_ next I dine at _five_."</p>
         <p>Thus he would find none to suspect him,</p>
         <p>Or, dinners given, to neglect him.</p>
         <p>He now to Coffee Houses went,</p>
         <p>With looks assuming calm content,</p>
         <p>And such as those are seen to wear,</p>
         <p>Who easy independence share.</p>
         <p>At reading-rooms he frequent sat,</p>
         <p>And read or join'd in social chat;</p>
         <p>Acquaintance made, no arduous task,</p>
         <p>Of those he did to dinner ask.</p>
         <p>In gay apartments then he shone</p>
         <p>In a good quarter of the town,</p>
         <p>But distant, as we may conceive,</p>
         <p>From where his masters us'd to live.</p>

         <p>QUÆ GENUS GIVES A GRAND PARTY.]</p>
         <p>_Miss Emily_, the blooming niece }</p>
         <p>Of the old Broker, Master _Squeeze_, }</p>
         <p>Who made some figure in the piece, }</p>
         <p>And, at no very distant page,</p>
         <p>Was seen to figure on the stage;</p>
         <p>The Lady all her points had carried,</p>
         <p>Was rich, and had the _Pleader_ married;</p>
         <p>Had chang'd her uncle's name of _Squeeze'em_</p>
         <p>To her shrewd husband's, Lawyer _Seize'em_:</p>
         <p>Who, by his cunning and his skill,</p>
         <p>Had brought all contests to her will,</p>
         <p>When he had got his promis'd fee</p>
         <p>Of Beauty, Wealth and Luxury.</p>
         <p>To her, with smiles of gay content,</p>
         <p>The _'Squire_ his eager footsteps bent,</p>
         <p>And did in lofty tone proclaim</p>
         <p>His change of fortune as of name;</p>
         <p>And told her it would be his pride,</p>
         <p>At a small Fête would she preside,</p>
         <p>Which he propos'd in style to give,</p>
         <p>Where he would all her friends receive;</p>
         <p>For this was now the only way</p>
         <p>He had to make his party gay:</p>
         <p>And the first flourish of his plan</p>
         <p>To figure as a _Gentleman_.</p>
         <p>--She smil'd and said she'd bring him plenty,</p>
         <p>Then ask'd at once his cards for twenty.</p>
         <p>--The fête was given,--the dance, the song,</p>
         <p>And feasting did the night prolong,</p>
         <p>Which pleasure gave to full two score,</p>
         <p>Whom he had never seen before;--</p>
         <p>But, his great object to maintain,</p>
         <p>These he must strive to see again;</p>
         <p>At all their doors his cards present,</p>
         <p>And thus, by various compliment,</p>
         <p>To form a circle of such friends</p>
         <p>As would secure his serious ends,</p>
         <p>In social ease to pass the day,</p>
         <p>And often find an evening gay.</p>
         <p>--But _'Squire Free-born_ quickly found</p>
         <p>He did not tread on solid ground,</p>
         <p>And 'gan to fear he should not see</p>
         <p>The way to that society,</p>
         <p>Which forms of life the happiest measure:</p>
         <p>By mutual interchange of pleasure.</p>
         <p>--'Twas but slight chat if he should meet</p>
         <p>His new acquaintance in the street;</p>
         <p>He seldom found, or more or less,</p>
         <p>But gen'ral forms of _politesse_,</p>
         <p>And that, too often, at the best,</p>
         <p>Was but in flimsy style exprest.</p>
         <p>--Ladies would ask him to the play,</p>
         <p>To take his arm and let him pay;</p>
         <p>And when to cards, he always lost</p>
         <p>More than the wine and biscuits cost.</p>
         <p>He found, as yet, but little done--</p>
         <p>'Twas neither common sense nor fun,</p>
         <p>Where kind regard would ne'er encrease,</p>
         <p>And int'rest wak'd the wish to please;</p>
         <p>Where words were either cold or hearty,</p>
         <p>As he propos'd to give a party;</p>
         <p>And a good supper was the charm</p>
         <p>That did to transient friendship warm,</p>
         <p>For that, alas, no longer lasted,</p>
         <p>Than while they thought on what they tasted.</p>
         <p>_'Squire Free-born_ soon began to feel</p>
         <p>A relaxation in his zeal</p>
         <p>To push away that class among</p>
         <p>Who did his evening parties throng,</p>
         <p>From whom no fair return was made,</p>
         <p>And mod'rate fashion was display'd.</p>
         <p>Manners were ap'd, but in a way</p>
         <p>That did vulgarity betray;</p>
         <p>And the best show that he might see,</p>
         <p>Was dash of awkward finery:--</p>
         <p>Besides, a rude and rough event</p>
         <p>Gave spirit to his discontent.</p>
         <p>--He call'd, one day, where, on admission,</p>
         <p>The parties were in sad condition;</p>
         <p>It was a scene of mutual flame,</p>
         <p>'Tween _Start-up_ and his lovely dame.</p>
         <p>He was a clerk on public duty,</p>
         <p>And she a most conceited beauty:</p>
         <p>When, as he enter'd, her sharp tongue</p>
         <p>Began in tones both harsh and strong,--</p>
         <p>"_Pray, FREE-BORN, do you think it breeding,</p>
         <p>That he should thus be always reading?_</p>
         <p>_When he does from his office come</p>
         <p>'Tis thus he sits hum-drum at home,</p>
         <p>As if he thought so low my wit</p>
         <p>I'm not for conversation fit;</p>
         <p>Nor does he seem to rate me higher</p>
         <p>Than to trace figures in the fire!"</p>
         <p>--"Call you, hum-drum, that information</p>
         <p>So suited to official station_,"</p>
         <p>He sternly said, "_which now engages</p>
         <p>Attention to these curious pages_!"</p>
         <p>--"_My mind_," she cried, "_was in the dark</p>
         <p>When I was married to a Clerk:--</p>
         <p>O had I join'd a fool instead</p>
         <p>Of one to office breeding bred!</p>
         <p>He, who in honour should protect me,</p>
         <p>You see, Sir, how he dares neglect me!_"</p>
         <p>--In terms polite to praise and blame,</p>
         <p>_Free-born_ now hop'd to quench the flame,</p>
         <p>And therefore offer'd, nothing loth,</p>
         <p>To give a little spice of both.</p>
         <p id="jqg17">[Illustration: _Drawn by Rowlandson_</p>
         <p>QUÆ GENUS, INTERRUPTS A TÊTE A TÊTE.]</p>
         <p>"Madam, by persons of discerning,</p>
         <p>My friend is known for store of learning;</p>
         <p>While you are bless'd with those rare charms,</p>
         <p>A Prince might wish to fill his arms."</p>
         <p>He gently smil'd and so did she,</p>
         <p>At this same two-fold flattery,</p>
         <p>Which, in a moment, seem'd to smother</p>
         <p>The flames of anger 'gainst each other:</p>
         <p>He therefore ventur'd to proceed,</p>
         <p>But did not now so well succeed.</p>
         <p>"You ask me to unfold my thought,</p>
         <p>Which is with truth and friendship fraught.</p>
         <p>We all well know, in life's great stake,</p>
         <p>There's such a Rule as _give and take_;</p>
         <p>A maxim, with your good in view,</p>
         <p>I recommend to both of you.</p>
         <p>On this, for peace, fix your reliance,</p>
         <p>And learn to practise kind compliance.</p>
         <p>If he is haughty, soothe his pride,</p>
         <p>Nor with disdainful glances chide.</p>
         <p>When you are angry, he must chase }</p>
         <p>All frownings from that lovely face, }</p>
         <p>With tender words and soft embrace. }</p>
         <p>Both of you now are in the wrong,</p>
         <p>_He_ with his BOOK,--_you_ with your TONGUE."</p>
         <p>But, ere he could his speech conclude,</p>
         <p>With scornful look and accents rude,</p>
         <p>Again the furious Dame began:--</p>
         <p>"_What Impudence is in the Man!</p>
         <p>Thus, 'gainst his betters, to let loose</p>
         <p>His vulgar tongue in such abuse.</p>
         <p>My husband to be thus belied,</p>
         <p>Who is my love, my boast, my pride!_"</p>
         <p>When _Start-up_ foam'd,--"_You risk your life,</p>
         <p>In treating thus my darling wife;</p>
         <p>Who, I proclaim, as 'tis my duty,</p>
         <p>Has charms superior to her beauty!_"</p>
         <p>Then each gave each a warm embrace,</p>
         <p>And both star'd in poor _Free-born's_ face,</p>
         <p>The one as if _he_ wish'd to beat him,</p>
         <p>The other as if _she_ could have eat him.</p>
         <p>He then, as suiting her desire,</p>
         <p>Threw the base volume in the fire,</p>
         <p>When she----"_Thus ends a petty fuss</p>
         <p>Which may cross those who love like us;</p>
         <p>Though I might wish it had not been</p>
         <p>By such a saucy booby seen_."</p>
         <p>--_Free-born_, but not from sense of fear,</p>
         <p>Now thought it best to disappear;</p>
         <p>And as they rang the clam'rous bell,</p>
         <p>He heard them both the servant tell--</p>
         <p>"Discharg'd you shall be, if the door</p>
         <p>Is open'd to that varlet more."</p>
         <p>--Such vulgar threat the _'Squire_ amus'd,</p>
         <p>For he no more would be refus'd</p>
         <p>By those whose silly actions prove</p>
         <p>That they could scold, and lie, and love:</p>
         <p>But still he rather felt the wrongs</p>
         <p>Which had proceeded from the tongues</p>
         <p>Of those who had no fair pretence</p>
         <p>At what he said to take offence:</p>
         <p>A pretty way to make amends</p>
         <p>For having treated them as friends;</p>
         <p>In short, he thought it best to fly</p>
         <p>His late acquir'd society:</p>
         <p>Pert Lawyers and such busy men</p>
         <p>As in some office wield the pen;</p>
         <p>Who, when their daily labour's done,</p>
         <p>Put their best coats and faces on;</p>
         <p>Leave home, where tallow dimly lights 'em,</p>
         <p>For wax, when some dull fool invites 'em,</p>
         <p>The plenteous evening to prolong</p>
         <p>In lively glee or tender song,</p>
         <p>Or in some funny tale to shine,</p>
         <p>And give a current to the wine.</p>
         <p>There, too, their wives and sisters flow, }</p>
         <p>Gay, scanty finery to show, }</p>
         <p>In gawdy trim and furbelow; }</p>
         <p>Who can, perhaps, the music play,</p>
         <p>And scream the carol of the day;</p>
         <p>Nay, work a waltz, while staring eyes</p>
         <p>Proclaim their gentle ecstasies.</p>
         <p>At length the shawls and wrappers come,</p>
         <p>When in their hacks they trundle home.</p>
         <p>--Though, after all, whate'er his aim,</p>
         <p>Whate'er his fancy chose to claim,</p>
         <p>'Twas not amiss;--this _first degree_</p>
         <p>In what is call'd society,</p>
         <p>Where step by step he must advance</p>
         <p>To higher place in fashion's dance:</p>
         <p>But with the folk, he 'gan to find,</p>
         <p>Who din'd with him, he never din'd,</p>
         <p>And got no more than casual tea</p>
         <p>For what his guests thought luxury;</p>
         <p>And, in a snug, familiar way,</p>
         <p>For all they gave, they made him pay.</p>
         <p>Besides, he sometimes felt offence,</p>
         <p>At what he thought impertinence:</p>
         <p>Such as they were, both great and small,</p>
         <p>He cut acquaintance with them all.</p>
         <p>His purse had thus indulg'd his whim,</p>
         <p>But they ne'er heard again from him.</p>
         <p>He now suspected that his plan,</p>
         <p>Of turning to a _Gentleman_,</p>
         <p>Was not so easy to be brought</p>
         <p>To such success as he had thought.</p>
         <p>But still he ventur'd to turn over</p>
         <p>New plans by which he might discover</p>
         <p>Some means to realize his scheme, }</p>
         <p>But it, at times, began to seem }</p>
         <p>Somewhat, indeed, too like a dream. }</p>
         <p>To thinking minds it is not strange</p>
         <p>That man is seen so soon to change,</p>
         <p>And, when he gets on random chace,</p>
         <p>To move so quick from place to place.</p>
         <p>If no fix'd principles he trust</p>
         <p>Which Reason says are true and just,</p>
         <p>The busy world will not restrain him,</p>
         <p>Nor in one beaten path maintain him.</p>
         <p>Now here, now there, he is as oft</p>
         <p>Seen to sink low as rise aloft.</p>
         <p>As he moves on, how he will vary</p>
         <p>From sober thought to gay vagary;</p>
         <p>Nay, seem the tempers to unite</p>
         <p>Of Dons 'bout whom historians write;</p>
         <p>The one whose name our laughter cheers,</p>
         <p>And he who pass'd his time in tears.</p>
         <p>What wonder then that we should see</p>
         <p>In _Free-born_, that variety,</p>
         <p>Which, in his disappointed mind,</p>
         <p>Nature may bid us look and find:</p>
         <p>Though he must guess profoundly well,</p>
         <p>Who could th' approaching change foretell.</p>
         <p>He long since felt it as a folly</p>
         <p>To think again on _pretty Molly_,</p>
         <p>But when his project seem'd to fail,</p>
         <p>Her image did again prevail;</p>
         <p>And humbler views began to find</p>
         <p>A passage to his wav'ring mind.</p>
         <p>Instead of striving to pursue</p>
         <p>What he now fear'd would never do,</p>
         <p>He fancied that a tender wife</p>
         <p>Might give a charm to rural life.</p>
         <p>_Molly_ he fear'd not he could move</p>
         <p>To bless a home with married Love,</p>
         <p>And that a cottage might be found,</p>
         <p>With garden green and meadow ground;</p>
         <p>Where he might form his fragrant bowers,</p>
         <p>And deck the pretty lawn with flowers;</p>
         <p>Beneath a beech-tree read his book, }</p>
         <p>And sometimes angle in the brook: }</p>
         <p>Nay, even wield a shepherd's crook. }</p>
         <p>Money he had, and so had she,</p>
         <p>And, with a due economy,</p>
         <p>Far from the noisy world remov'd,</p>
         <p>And by each other fondly lov'd,</p>
         <p>They might pass on in plenteous ease,</p>
         <p>And lead a life of smiling peace.</p>
         <p>He slept, and, in a dream, he swore, }</p>
         <p>He saw his _Parent-Friend_, once more-- }</p>
         <p>Not looking as he did before, }</p>
         <p>But all so smirking, blithe and gay;</p>
         <p>When, sitting on a cock of hay,</p>
         <p>The prong and rake he seem'd to wield,</p>
         <p>As he were master of the field:</p>
         <p>He spoke not, but he seem'd to speak,--</p>
         <p>"_This is the life, boy, you must seek_."</p>
         <p>--Such was another strong emotion</p>
         <p>To aid the new, romantic notion,</p>
         <p>And think of nought but Cottage Life,</p>
         <p>With pretty MOLLY for his Wife.</p>
         <p>He turn'd this over in his mind,</p>
         <p>And ev'ry hour felt more inclin'd</p>
         <p>To take the Maiden by surprize,</p>
         <p>And this fond dream to realize.</p>
         <p>Sweet MOLLY now was gone from town</p>
         <p>As waiting-maid to _Lady Brown_,</p>
         <p>Who lives a portion of the year</p>
         <p>At her fine place in Devonshire;</p>
         <p>Nor did _fond Corydon_ delay</p>
         <p>To write his mind another day:</p>
         <p>While, to amuse th' impatient hours,</p>
         <p>He fill'd his room with shrubs and flowers:</p>
         <p>Branching _Geraniums_ were seen</p>
         <p>To make his ev'ry window green,</p>
         <p>And something like a picture wear</p>
         <p>Of future scenery he might share.</p>
         <p>Our time does like our watches go</p>
         <p>Sometimes too fast,--sometimes too slow;</p>
         <p>But to the _'Squire_, for he was still</p>
         <p>A _'Squire_, though now against his will,</p>
         <p>Old _Bald-Pate_ mov'd with tardy tread,</p>
         <p>As if his feet were hung with lead;</p>
         <p>But he went on:--An answer came,</p>
         <p>Sign'd MOLLY, with no other name!</p>
         <p>He thought it odd, but did not wait</p>
         <p>To make it matter of debate,</p>
         <p>So quick his hurry to be shown</p>
         <p>The passion which the page would own.</p>
         <p>He read,--"_I've heard, bless Heav'n, my friend! }</p>
         <p>(With thanks for what you might intend,) }</p>
         <p>Your serving days are at an end: }</p>
         <p>Thus I believ'd, and find it true,</p>
         <p>I could no longer think of you.</p>
         <p>It seems to be your prosp'rous fate</p>
         <p>To come into a great estate;</p>
         <p>And so I thought it Heaven's decree,</p>
         <p>You ought no more to think of me.</p>
         <p>Besides, as you have never wrote,</p>
         <p>I fancied Molly was forgot;</p>
         <p>When soon a tender lover came,</p>
         <p>A learned man, of preaching fame;</p>
         <p>He press'd me,--I was not obdurate,</p>
         <p>And so, I'm married to a CURATE!</p>
         <p>The match my Lady much approv'd,</p>
         <p>And my good Husband's so belov'd,</p>
         <p>Our kind SIR JOHN has given his word</p>
         <p>That he shall shortly be preferr'd._</p>
         <p>* * * * *</p>
         <p>Poor _Corydon_ could read no more, }</p>
         <p>But, in a rage the letter tore, }</p>
         <p>And kick'd the fragments round the floor: }</p>
         <p>Toss'd some things up, and some things down,</p>
         <p>Curs'd both the _Country_ and the _Town_;</p>
         <p>With pots and pans did battle rage--</p>
         <p>Drove the geraniums from the stage,</p>
         <p>And wish'd no object now to see</p>
         <p>_Of ruralized felicity_.</p>
         <p>The country letter turn'd the tide</p>
         <p>To rush upon his wounded pride:</p>
         <p>At once he thought it more than folly</p>
         <p>Thus to have offer'd love to _Molly_.</p>
         <p>Nay, he began to smile at length;</p>
         <p>And, to regain becoming strength,</p>
         <p>He took to the well-known resort</p>
         <p>Of season'd dish and good _Old Port_:</p>
         <p>When as he sat, with uplift eyes, }</p>
         <p>And, thro' the window, view'd the skies, }</p>
         <p>He ventur'd to soliloquize. }</p>
         <p>"My _genteel folk_ I have declin'd,</p>
         <p>At least, the sort which I could find;</p>
         <p>And just as much dispos'd to sneeze</p>
         <p>At all my _Rural Deities_:</p>
         <p>But still I've got a heap of _Cash_,</p>
         <p>And, while it lasts, will make a _Dash_!</p>
         <p>But here one firm resolve I make,--</p>
         <p>_I never will my Elbow shake_;</p>
         <p>And if I take care not to _play_, }</p>
         <p>I shall get something for my pay: }</p>
         <p>It will not _all_ be thrown away! }</p>
         <p>Who knows what CUPID, too, may do?</p>
         <p>For I may _win_ if I should _woo_;</p>
         <p>And e'en, in spite of this same _Hump_,</p>
         <p>_Fortune_ may turn me up a trump.</p>
         <p>--My standard now shall be unfurl'd,</p>
         <p>And I will rush into the world:</p>
         <p>Nay, when I have the world enjoy'd,</p>
         <p>With emptied purse and spirits cloy'd,</p>
         <p>I then can trip it o'er the main:</p>
         <p>VALCOUR will take me back again;</p>
         <p>Once more his humble friend receive,</p>
         <p>With all the welcome he can give:</p>
         <p>We know not what from ill may screen us,</p>
         <p>And I, once more, shall be QUÆ GENUS."</p>
         <p>--He spoke, and seem'd to close his plan</p>
         <p>Of keeping up the _Gentleman_.</p>
         <p>The Sun had sunk beneath the west,</p>
         <p>To go to bed and take his rest,</p>
         <p>As Poets feign, in THETIS lap,</p>
         <p>Where he ne'er fails to have a nap;</p>
         <p>When, with his second bottle rallied,</p>
         <p>Our Hero rose, and out he sallied</p>
         <p>In search of any lively fun,</p>
         <p>That he, perchance, might hit upon.</p>
         <p>--As through a court he chanc'd to pass,</p>
         <p>He saw a gay, well-figur'd lass,</p>
         <p>Who, in her floating fripp'ry shone,</p>
         <p>With all the trim of fashion on.</p>
         <p>She had descended from a coach,</p>
         <p>And did a certain door approach,</p>
         <p>With tripping step and eager haste,</p>
         <p>When soon th' illumin'd arch she pass'd:</p>
         <p>And still he saw, in height of feather,</p>
         <p>Small parties enter there together,</p>
         <p>While jovial gentlemen appear'd,</p>
         <p>Who, as they came, each other cheer'd.</p>
         <p>--He asked, where these fine Ladies went?</p>
         <p>The watchman said,--"For merriment;</p>
         <p>And should a little dancing fit you,</p>
         <p>A crown, your honour, will admit you."</p>
         <p>--The 'Squire then rapp'd, the door was op'd,</p>
         <p>He gave his coin, and in he popp'd:</p>
         <p>The music sounded in the hall,</p>
         <p>And smiling faces grac'd the ball,</p>
         <p>Where, as he lov'd a merry trip</p>
         <p>With some _gay Miss_ he chose to skip,</p>
         <p>But as they _Waltz'd_ it round in pairs</p>
         <p>A noise was heard upon the stairs,</p>
         <p>And strait a magistrate appear'd</p>
         <p>With solemn aspect; while, uprear'd,</p>
         <p>Official staves in order stand,</p>
         <p>To wait the laws' so rude command.</p>
         <p>--Sad hurry and confusion wait</p>
         <p>On this their unexpected state;</p>
         <p>When there broke forth, as it might seem,</p>
         <p>From snow-white throats, a fearful scream;</p>
         <p>Nor, to add horror, was there wanting</p>
         <p>Some strong appearances of fainting:</p>
         <p>But Justice, with its iron brow</p>
         <p>Unfeeling scowl'd on all the show.</p>
         <p>In shriller tones the ladies cried,</p>
         <p>In diff'rent key the beaux replied,</p>
         <p>Though some consoling bev'rage quaff,</p>
         <p>Give a smart twirl, nor fear to laugh:</p>
         <p>While coarser voices,--"hold your tongue,</p>
         <p>Pack up your alls and come along."</p>
         <p>Then, of fair culprits full a score,</p>
         <p>And of their dancing partners more,</p>
         <p>Beneath stern power's relentless rod,</p>
         <p>Were rang'd, and order'd off to QUOD.</p>
         <p>They march'd away in long procession</p>
         <p>To take the fruits of their transgression:--</p>
         <p>Staffmen did at their head appear,</p>
         <p>And watchmen lighted up the rear.</p>
         <p>Our Hero felt the ridicule</p>
         <p>Of having idly play'd the fool,</p>
         <p>And, as he handed on his _Belle_,</p>
         <p>He could not but compare the smell</p>
         <p>That rotten root and trodden leaf</p>
         <p>Do to th' offended senses give</p>
         <p>Of those who, by the lamp's pale light,</p>
         <p>Through Covent-Garden stroll at night,</p>
         <p>With all the garlands which he weav'd</p>
         <p>Ere Molly's letter was receiv'd:</p>
         <p>And all the fragrance of the flowers</p>
         <p>He thought to cull in Molly's bowers;</p>
         <p>Nay, which, but the preceding morning,</p>
         <p>His promis'd hopes had been adorning.</p>
         <p>It was indeed a noisome change,</p>
         <p>O it was strange, 'twas passing strange!</p>
         <p>But still the watch-house made amends,</p>
         <p>Such as they were, they gave him friends.</p>
         <p>Which here, I'm not suppos'd to think</p>
         <p>Were such as save from ruin's brink;</p>
         <p>But lively sprites who have a taste</p>
         <p>To hurry on the stream to waste.</p>
         <p>Thus, when the welcome morn was come,</p>
         <p>And Justice sent the party home;</p>
         <p>He and two blades of certain feather</p>
         <p>Propos'd to pass the day together:</p>
         <p>The one, more grave, declar'd his breed,</p>
         <p>Famous on t'other side the _Tweed_,</p>
         <p>The other lively, brisk and airy,</p>
         <p>Boasted his birth in _Tipperary_;</p>
         <p>Though whether this were truly so,</p>
         <p>'Tis from their words alone we know:</p>
         <p>But they were easy, free and jolly,</p>
         <p>Decided foes to melancholy,</p>
         <p>And seem'd well-form'd to aid a day</p>
         <p>In passing pleasantly away.</p>
         <p>--But first the TRIO thought it best</p>
         <p>To snatch some hours' refreshing rest,</p>
         <p>When, as it was in Summer's pride, }</p>
         <p>They pass'd their jovial hours beside }</p>
         <p>The crystal _Thames_ imperial tide; }</p>
         <p>And as the river roll'd along,</p>
         <p>Made the banks echo with their song.</p>
         <p>--At length it was a rival jest</p>
         <p>Who of the three could sing the best.</p>
         <p>--The sturdy Scot the song began,</p>
         <p>And thus th' harmonious contest ran.</p>
         <p>WALLACE, who fought and bled, he sung,</p>
         <p>Whose name dwells on a nation's tongue.</p>
         <p>The 'SQUIRE, in boist'rous tone declar'd,</p>
         <p>And neither lungs nor quavering spar'd,</p>
         <p>That Britain triumph'd o'er the waves</p>
         <p>And Britons never would be slaves.</p>
         <p>Then ERIN'S SON, with sweeter voice,</p>
         <p>Exclaim'd, "I'll make you both rejoice;</p>
         <p>O with a famous song I'll treat you,</p>
         <p>And then you both shall say I've beat you</p>
         <p>Your verses are old-fashion'd prosing,</p>
         <p>My song is of my own composing;</p>
         <p>And though 'tis to lov'd ERIN'S fame,</p>
         <p>To all three Kingdoms 'tis the same."</p>
         <p>The hearers both politely bow'd, }</p>
         <p>When he, of his fam'd subject proud, }</p>
         <p>Pour'd forth his accents deep and loud. }</p>

         <p>QUÆ GENUS committed, with a riotous dancing Party, to the Watch-House.]</p>
         <p>SONG.</p>
         <p>It has long been agreed by all persons of learning</p>
         <p>Who in stories of old have a ready discerning,</p>
         <p>That in every country which travellers paint,</p>
         <p>There has always been found a protector or saint.</p>
         <p>Derry down, etc.</p>
         <p>St. George for Old England, with target and lance,</p>
         <p>St. Andrew for Scotland, St. Denis for France,</p>
         <p>St. David o'er Wales, so long known to preside,</p>
         <p>And St. Patrick, Hibernia's patron and pride.</p>
         <p>Derry down, etc.</p>
         <p>He was gallant and brave as a saint ought to be,</p>
         <p>For St. George was not braver or better than he,</p>
         <p>He would drink and would sing and would rattle like thunder,</p>
         <p>Though 'twas said, he was, now and then given to blunder.</p>
         <p>Derry down, etc.</p>
         <p>But the jests of his friends he took in good part,</p>
         <p>For his blunders were nought but th' excess of his heart;</p>
         <p>Though there was but one blunder he ever would own,</p>
         <p>And that was when he saw all the claret was gone.</p>
         <p>Derry down, etc.</p>
         <p>He'd fight for his country's religion and laws,</p>
         <p>And when beauty was injur'd he took up the cause,</p>
         <p>For the gallant St. Patrick, as ev'ry one knows,</p>
         <p>Was fond of a pretty girl under the rose.</p>
         <p>Derry down, etc</p>
         <p>So many his virtues, it would be too long</p>
         <p>To rehearse them at once in a ballad or song;</p>
         <p>Then with laughter and mirth let us hallow his shrine,</p>
         <p>And drown all his Bulls in a bumper of wine.</p>
         <p>Derry down, etc.</p>
         <p>Then St. _Patrick_, St. _George_ and St. _Andrew_ shall be</p>
         <p>The Protectors of Kingdoms so brave and so free:</p>
         <p>Thus in vain will the thunders of _Denis_ be hurl'd,</p>
         <p>For our _Trio of Saints_ shall give laws to the world.</p>
         <p>Derry down, etc.</p>
         <p>Hard went the hands upon the board,</p>
         <p>And ERIN'S praises were _encor'd_.</p>
         <p>Thus when the pleasant song was heard,</p>
         <p>HIBERNIA'S minstrel was preferr'd;</p>
         <p>Nor from the voice or in the eye</p>
         <p>Was there a hint of jealousy:</p>
         <p>Nay, while they took their parting glass,</p>
         <p>These sentiments were heard to pass.</p>
         <p>"The Thistle, Shamrock and the Rose</p>
         <p>May challenge all the world at blows:</p>
         <p>_English_ and _Irish_ names are known,--</p>
         <p>There's _Marlborough_ and _Wellington_;</p>
         <p>And O, what men of glorious name</p>
         <p>Do _Scotia's_ annals give to Fame!"</p>

         <p>And varnish'd o'er with impudence,</p>
         <p>A proud admittance might obtain</p>
         <p>With chance to be turn'd out again:</p>
         <p>Nor was the luckless _Freeborn_ spar'd,</p>
         <p>When he the saucy trial dar'd.</p>
         <p>--One night, the hour we need not tell,</p>
         <p>Into a trap the coxcomb fell.</p>
         <p>As through the streets he rattled on</p>
         <p>Lamps with inviting brilliance shone;</p>
         <p>The music's sound, the portal's din</p>
         <p>Told 'twas a joyous scene within:</p>
         <p>The second bottle of the night,</p>
         <p>Might have produced a double sight,</p>
         <p>And two-fold courage to pursue</p>
         <p>The splendid prospect in his view,</p>
         <p>He, therefore bade the Hack approach,</p>
         <p>And at the door present the coach;</p>
         <p>Then made a push, got through the hall,</p>
         <p>And quickly mingled with the ball.</p>
         <p>--Whether his face was too well known</p>
         <p>Among the dashers of the town,</p>
         <p>Who do not an admittance gain</p>
         <p>Among the more distinguish'd train,</p>
         <p>Whose social habits will exclude</p>
         <p>The mere street-trampling multitude,</p>
         <p>Who, like the insects of a day,</p>
         <p>Make a short buzz and pass away:</p>
         <p>Or whether the intruding sinner</p>
         <p>Eat as he seem'd to want a dinner;</p>
         <p>Or if it did his fancy suit</p>
         <p>To line his pocket with the fruit;</p>
         <p>Or if he let some signal fly,</p>
         <p>Not usual in such company,</p>
         <p>Or if his spirits were so loud</p>
         <p>As to alarm the polish'd crowd;</p>
         <p>Whatever was the Spell that bound him,</p>
         <p>Suspicion more than hover'd round him;</p>
         <p>For, he replied with silent stare, }</p>
         <p>As he was taken unaware, }</p>
         <p>When he was ask'd how he came there. }</p>
         <p>Nor did he show a visage bold</p>
         <p>When, in a whisper, he was told,</p>
         <p>But still with steady look express'd</p>
         <p>By the stern Master of the feast,</p>
         <p>If he wish'd not to play a farce</p>
         <p>To make his pretty figure scarce.</p>
         <p>--That such a part he might not play }</p>
         <p>Which menac'd e'en the least delay, }</p>
         <p>He thought it best to glide away; }</p>
         <p>And, to avoid the threat'ning rout,</p>
         <p>As he push'd in, he darted out.</p>
         <p>A tonish Matron who ne'er fail'd</p>
         <p>Where she was ask'd and cards prevail'd,</p>
         <p>My Lady Dangle was her name,</p>
         <p>And 'twas the fancy of the dame</p>
         <p>Still to retain the antique plan</p>
         <p>At night to dance in a _Sedan</p>
         <p>Sedans_, so known the fair to coop,</p>
         <p>When clad in the expanding hoop,</p>
         <p>Snug chairs borne on by sturdy feet,</p>
         <p>Once seen in ev'ry courtly street;</p>
         <p>And one a most uncommon sight,</p>
         <p>Was waiting at the door to-night;</p>
         <p>Which, in all due array, was come,</p>
         <p>To bear my _Lady Dangle_ home.</p>
         <p>The Chairmen lifted up the top,</p>
         <p>When _Freeborn_, with a sprightly hop,</p>
         <p>And his cloak wrapp'd around his face,</p>
         <p>Made bold to seize the vacant place:</p>
         <p>The bearers, not intent to know,</p>
         <p>Whether it were a _Belle_ or _Beau_,</p>
         <p>Went on--a cheary footman bore</p>
         <p>A flambeau, blund'ring on before:</p>
         <p>While, ere the 'Squire, in this sad scrape,</p>
         <p>Had time to plan his next escape,</p>
         <p>A heap of Paviour's stones which lay</p>
         <p>Directly in the Chairmen's way,</p>
         <p>Gave them a fall upon the road,</p>
         <p>With their alarm'd, mistaken load.</p>
         <p>Each Watchman sprang his rousing rattle,</p>
         <p>But as no voices call'd for battle,</p>
         <p>They did the best without delay</p>
         <p>To set the party on their way:</p>
         <p>While the attendants on the chair,</p>
         <p>Half-blinded by the flambeau's glare,</p>
         <p>First rais'd their weighty forms and then</p>
         <p>Set the _Sedan_ upright again:</p>
         <p>Nor e'er attempted to explore</p>
         <p>The hapless head that burst the door.</p>
         <p>But such was _Freeborn's_ falling fate,</p>
         <p>Which such confusion did create</p>
         <p>Within the region of his brain,</p>
         <p>He did not know his home again:</p>
         <p>Nay, when the wearied Chairmen stopp'd,</p>
         <p>Into the house he stagg'ring popp'd;</p>
         <p>Then to and fro got up the stairs,</p>
         <p>And, straddling o'er opposing chairs,</p>
         <p>He star'd, but knew not he was come }</p>
         <p>To Lady Dangle's Drawing Room, }</p>
         <p>But wildly thought himself at home. }</p>
         <p>Then on a sofa threw his length,</p>
         <p>Thus to regain exhausted strength,</p>
         <p>And grunted, groan'd and drew his breath,</p>
         <p>As if it were the hour of death.</p>
         <p>Sir David Dangle, whom the gout</p>
         <p>Had kept that night from going out,</p>
         <p>Was sitting in all sick-man's quiet,</p>
         <p>Nor dreaming of a scene of riot</p>
         <p>When, waken'd into wild amaze,</p>
         <p>He did on the strange vision gaze,</p>
         <p>While the bold reprobate intrusion</p>
         <p>Threw all the house into confusion.</p>
         <p>In rush'd domestics one and all,</p>
         <p>Who heard the bell's alarming call;</p>
         <p>While stamping crutch and roaring voice</p>
         <p>Encreas'd the Knight's awak'ning noise</p>
         <p>That he might quick assistance stir</p>
         <p>Against this unknown visiter.</p>
         <p>But while the household struggled hard</p>
         <p>To keep him still, and be his guard,</p>
         <p>Till he thought fit to lay before 'em</p>
         <p>The cause of all his indecorum;</p>
         <p>My Lady came to set all right</p>
         <p>And check the hurry of the night:</p>
         <p>She then, to soothe his rude alarms</p>
         <p>Clasp'd her dear Knight within her arms,</p>
         <p>Those arms which, for full forty years,</p>
         <p>As from tradition it appears,</p>
         <p>Had sometimes strok'd his chin and coax'd him,</p>
         <p>And now and then had soundly box'd him.</p>
         <p>"It is," she said, "some heated rake,</p>
         <p>Who has occasion'd the mistake.</p>
         <p>But loose your hands, I do protest,</p>
         <p>To be thus us'd, he's too well drest</p>
         <p>For though his face I do not know }</p>
         <p>He does some air of fashion show, }</p>
         <p>Playing his pranks incognito." }</p>
         <p>--"It may be so," the Knight replied,</p>
         <p>And then he shook his head and sigh'd:</p>
         <p>"I'm not a stranger to the game,</p>
         <p>When I was young, I did the same."</p>
         <p>--Beside Sir David, Madam sat:</p>
         <p>To charm his flurry with her chat</p>
         <p>Her tongue pour'd forth its ready store</p>
         <p>And talk'd the busy evening o'er;</p>
         <p>Their biscuits took and, nothing loth,</p>
         <p>Moisten'd them well with cordial broth;</p>
         <p>Thus, till bed call'd, enjoy'd their quaffing,</p>
         <p>He with hoarse chuckle--she with laughing.</p>

         <p>THE PARTY BREAKING UP, AND QUÆ GENUS BREAKING DOWN.]</p>
         <p>As he his innocence had vow'd,</p>
         <p>Our Hero press'd his hands and bow'd,</p>
         <p>Nay look'd, with humble, downcast eye,</p>
         <p>The Mirror of Apology.</p>
         <p>Besides, he well knew how to bribe</p>
         <p>The service of the liv'ried tribe;</p>
         <p>So, without fear of ill to come,</p>
         <p>He was convey'd in safety home.</p>
         <p>--With the next noon his morning came,</p>
         <p>And serious thoughts began to claim</p>
         <p>Attention to the Life he past,</p>
         <p>And how much longer it might last:</p>
         <p>For the hard blow he had receiv'd,</p>
         <p>By the chair's fall, had so aggriev'd</p>
         <p>The Pericranium's tend'rest part</p>
         <p>That it requir'd a Surgeon's art,</p>
         <p>Who, to relieve the threat'ning pains</p>
         <p>Applied the leeches to his veins,</p>
         <p>He then with blistering proceeded,</p>
         <p>The strong Cathartic next succeeded,</p>
         <p>With light debarr'd to either eye,</p>
         <p>And undisturb'd tranquillity:</p>
         <p>Such was the system to restore</p>
         <p>His health to what it was before.</p>
         <p>Thus bound to silence and confin'd</p>
         <p>It was a period for the mind</p>
         <p>To yield to those reflecting powers</p>
         <p>Which flow from solitary hours.</p>
         <p>'Tis said by one, no chattering dunce</p>
         <p>That changes seldom come at once;</p>
         <p>And to those changes we refer</p>
         <p>Which work in human character.</p>
         <p>Reason at once does not disown us,</p>
         <p>Nor instant folly seize upon us;</p>
         <p>It is by a progressive course</p>
         <p>That habit sinks from bad to worse,</p>
         <p>And thus the happier impulse moves</p>
         <p>By which the character improves:</p>
         <p>The struggle that controuls the will</p>
         <p>From ill to good, from good to ill,</p>
         <p>Is not a contest for the power</p>
         <p>That lasts but through a transient hour.</p>
         <p>Virtue's fine ardor does not yield</p>
         <p>But after many a well-fought field;--</p>
         <p>Nor do the baser passions cool</p>
         <p>Till they despair to overule,</p>
         <p>By secret spell or Virtue's fire,</p>
         <p>The glowing of the heart's desire.</p>
         <p>Thus, as through pictur'd life we range,</p>
         <p>We see the varying landscape change,</p>
         <p>But, as the diff'rent scenes we view,</p>
         <p>If we have hearts we feel them too:</p>
         <p>And then, how charming is the sight</p>
         <p>When Virtue rises to its height</p>
         <p>And triumphs o'er the conquer'd foe</p>
         <p>That flaps its baffled wing below.</p>
         <p>What though such images as these</p>
         <p>May look to Eccentricities</p>
         <p>Beyond the reach of those whose claim</p>
         <p>Is shelter'd by a borrow'd name:</p>
         <p>Yet still our system may apply</p>
         <p>The force of its philosophy</p>
         <p>To ev'ry track of human life,</p>
         <p>Where the heart feels conflicting strife;</p>
         <p>In short, where 'tis the painful lot,</p>
         <p>And in what bosom is it not,</p>
         <p>To struggle in the certain feud</p>
         <p>Between the evil and the good,</p>
         <p>That in our mortal nature lies</p>
         <p>With all its known propensities:</p>
         <p>Nor shall we on our Hero trample</p>
         <p>As an inadequate example.</p>
         <p>He'll serve as well as brighter tools</p>
         <p>To give an edge to moral rules,</p>
         <p>And _Freeborn's_ frolics may prevail</p>
         <p>To give a spirit to the tale</p>
         <p>Which in its fashion and its feature</p>
         <p>Bears, as we trust, the stamp of nature.</p>
         <p>--Besides, it surely has appear'd,</p>
         <p>He was at first in virtue rear'd,</p>
         <p>Nor do we fear, however cross'd,</p>
         <p>His Virtue has been wholly lost:</p>
         <p>Nor will our kind and honest muse</p>
         <p>The hope, nay the belief refuse,</p>
         <p>That, after all his follies past,</p>
         <p>Much good may still remain at last</p>
         <p>Which might, with Reason's aid, at length,</p>
         <p>Be felt in more than former strength.</p>
         <p>How this may happen we shall see</p>

         <p>Thus he, for many a night and day,</p>
         <p>In strict, prescriptive silence lay,</p>
         <p>For he all talking was forbid</p>
         <p>No friends must visit, if they did,</p>
         <p>All Galen's efforts would be vain</p>
         <p>For the re-settling of his brain;</p>
         <p>And when acquaintance chanc'd to come</p>
         <p>It must be said, "He's not at home:"</p>
         <p>Nay, his kind friends, when it appear'd,</p>
         <p>That e'en his life was rather fear'd,</p>
         <p>And that his hospitable fare</p>
         <p>Might quickly vanish into air:</p>
         <p>Though as the knocker still was tied,</p>
         <p>They just ask'd if he liv'd or died.</p>
         <p>But other reasons soon prevail</p>
         <p>That made his vain pretensions fail</p>
         <p>To ask them now and then to dine,</p>
         <p>And prove their welcome by his wine.</p>
         <p>For when they left him others came,</p>
         <p>More constant in their wish and aim;</p>
         <p>Who, while the Doctor order'd pills,</p>
         <p>Would call, perhaps, to leave their bills;</p>
         <p>And sometimes in the way of trade</p>
         <p>Might ask the favour to be paid.</p>
         <p>These things, as he lay still in bed,</p>
         <p>Would sometimes tease his shaken head,</p>
         <p>And force him to consult his hoard, }</p>
         <p>To know what hopes that might afford }</p>
         <p>When he to health should be restor'd. }</p>
         <p>--That time arriv'd and he was free</p>
         <p>From offering another fee,</p>
         <p>But then he found more clumsy hands</p>
         <p>Ready to grasp enlarg'd demands.</p>
         <p>--In all the playgames he had sought</p>
         <p>He found, at last, as might be thought,</p>
         <p>In worst of scrapes he now was left,</p>
         <p>Our 'Squire, alas, was deep in debt,</p>
         <p>And which was worse, of the amount,</p>
         <p>He could not pay the full account:</p>
         <p>Nor were his drooping spirits cheer'd</p>
         <p>When ev'ry day a Dun appear'd.</p>
         <p>There were no frolics now to charm</p>
         <p>The mind from feeling the alarm,</p>
         <p>At thought so painful to endure</p>
         <p>Th' afflicting thought of being poor.</p>
         <p>But though Discretion oft had fail'd him,</p>
         <p>And Folly's Gim-crack schemes assail'd him</p>
         <p>Though his whole conduct might not bear</p>
         <p>The scrutinizing eye severe:</p>
         <p>Yet honour was not dispossest</p>
         <p>Of a snug corner in his breast,</p>
         <p>Which there an influence did maintain,</p>
         <p>And, call'd to speak, spoke not in vain;</p>
         <p>For he refus'd, at once, to hear</p>
         <p>What smiling Knaves pour'd in his ear,</p>
         <p>To scrape the relics of his hoard,</p>
         <p>Make a long skip and get abroad;</p>
         <p>Seize the first favourable wind,</p>
         <p>And laugh at those he left behind.</p>
         <p>--The counsel given, was given in vain;</p>
         <p>He met it with a just disdain,</p>
         <p>Bore with mild humour each sly sneer,</p>
         <p>And smil'd when Folly chose to jeer;</p>
         <p>Resolv'd to pay to his last groat,</p>
         <p>Though standing in his only coat.</p>
         <p>--'Twas thus he thought in temper cool,</p>
         <p>"I may be call'd vain, silly fool,</p>
         <p>And something more I might deserve,</p>
         <p>But I would dig or almost starve,</p>
         <p>Rather than in that concert join,</p>
         <p>Which sprightly vagabonds design."</p>
         <p>--Suspicion may be sometimes led</p>
         <p>To doubt the vows which, on the bed</p>
         <p>Of pain and sickness, may be made, }</p>
         <p>When, by a trait'rous world betray'd }</p>
         <p>Hope's future prospects sink and fade. }</p>
         <p>For when Contrition views the past,</p>
         <p>Because the passing day's o'ercast</p>
         <p>Yet does no more its place retain</p>
         <p>When smiling hours return again,</p>
         <p>'Tis but an hypocritic art</p>
         <p>To mock the world and cheat the heart.</p>
         <p>But our sick Hero, as the verse</p>
         <p>Will, with unvarnish'd truth, rehearse,</p>
         <p>An eye of tearful sorrow threw }</p>
         <p>O'er some past years' reproachful view, }</p>
         <p>And trembling at the future too. }</p>
         <p>Thus, of some awkward fears possess'd,</p>
         <p>He held a council in his breast,</p>
         <p>And felt the way to be pursued</p>
         <p>Was now to do the best he could,</p>
         <p>And call on Justice to receive</p>
         <p>The only tribute he could give.</p>
         <p>Thus, at once, honest and discreet,</p>
         <p>He call'd his Creditors to meet</p>
         <p>To hear proposals which he thought</p>
         <p>They would receive as just men ought:</p>
         <p>Nay, fancied, when he told his tale,</p>
         <p>That lib'ral notions would prevail;</p>
         <p>Nor could his gen'rous mind foresee</p>
         <p>The fruits of his integrity:</p>
         <p>For when he walk'd into the room</p>
         <p>He found th' invited guests were come,</p>
         <p>Who soon began in hideous measure,</p>
         <p>To play away their loud displeasure,</p>
         <p>Not unlike _Andrews_ at a fair</p>
         <p>Who to make gaping rustics stare,</p>
         <p>Expand their lanky, lanthern jaws</p>
         <p>That fire may issue from their maws.</p>
         <p>One darted forth revengeful looks,</p>
         <p>Another pointed to his books</p>
         <p>Wherein a charge was never made, }</p>
         <p>That did not honour to his trade; }</p>
         <p>And curs'd th' accounts which were not paid, }</p>
         <p>Nor fail'd to wish he could convey them,</p>
         <p>We'll not say where, who did not pay them.</p>
         <p>A _third_, as hard as he was able,</p>
         <p>Struck his huge fist upon the table.</p>
         <p>While, beastly names from many a tongue,</p>
         <p>Around the room resounding rung.</p>
         <p>As _Freeborn_ had not quite possest</p>
         <p>The hope that he should be carest,</p>
         <p>He rather look'd with down-cast eye,</p>
         <p>To win by his humility,</p>
         <p>And put on a repentant face</p>
         <p>As suited to the awkward place:</p>
         <p>Nay, his high spirits he prepar'd</p>
         <p>And call'd discretion for their guard</p>
         <p>In case, though it was not expected,</p>
         <p>Decorum should be quite neglected:--</p>
         <p>But when the Butcher strok'd his sleeve, }</p>
         <p>Brandish'd his steel and call'd him thief, }</p>
         <p>Belching forth mutton, veal and beef; }</p>
         <p>When touch'd by such a market sample</p>
         <p>They join'd to follow his example;</p>
         <p>When stead of praise for honest doing }</p>
         <p>And the fair course he was pursuing }</p>
         <p>They loos'd their banter on his ruin; }</p>
         <p>His prudence then was thrown aside</p>
         <p>From sense of irritated pride,</p>
         <p>And, patient bearing quite exhausted,</p>
         <p>He thus the angry circle roasted.--</p>

         <p>And, without prefatory art,</p>
         <p>Was heard opinions to impart</p>

         <p>Nor will I please you now by lying.</p>
         <p>For no short time, you all can tell,</p>

         <p>Resolv'd its purport to explore,</p>
         <p>And strait to _Number_ THREE repairs</p>
         <p>When hobbling down the ancient stairs,</p>
         <p>He met the Matron whom he sought,</p>
         <p>And told his story as he ought,</p>
         <p>A rapid sketch--nor did it fail</p>
         <p>To be an interesting Tale:</p>
         <p>Which when she heard, against the wall</p>
         <p>The broom she held was seen to fall,</p>
         <p>And scarce her old arms could prevail</p>
         <p>To bear the burthen of her pail.</p>
         <p>Her glasses then she sought to place</p>
         <p>On the _Proboscis_ of her face;</p>
         <p>Not that a likeness she should see</p>
         <p>'Tween riper years and infancy.</p>
         <p>But now her heart began to melt</p>
         <p>At _Recollections_ that she felt,</p>
         <p>And thus she wish'd to tell them o'er,</p>
         <p>As she had often done before.</p>
         <p>"What, though so many years are gone,</p>
         <p>And you to man's estate are grown,</p>
         <p>Since I, in all its infant charms,</p>
         <p>Dandled the Foundling in my arms,</p>
         <p>Were I but certain it was _you_,</p>
         <p>Yes I would hug--and kiss you too."</p>
         <p>--But though he vow'd and did exclaim</p>
         <p>He was the very--very same;</p>
         <p>And though he put forth ev'ry grace }</p>
         <p>With which his words could gild his face, }</p>
         <p>He could not gain a kind embrace; }</p>
         <p>Though twenty-five don't often sue</p>
         <p>To claim a kiss from sixty-two:</p>
         <p>But some suspicions had possess'd</p>
         <p>The avenues to _Betty's_ breast;</p>
         <p>For she liv'd where her open ear</p>
         <p>Was practis'd ev'ry day to hear</p>
         <p>Of art array'd in fairest guise</p>
         <p>And truth o'erthrown by artifice.</p>
         <p>Thus what could the old Matron do?</p>
         <p>She fear'd him false, and wish'd him true:</p>
         <p>Then turn'd him round, but look'd aghast,</p>
         <p>As at his back her eye she cast;</p>
         <p>When she thus spoke, and heav'd a sigh,</p>
         <p>"I hope it is not treachery!</p>
         <p>Before that door the child lay sprawling,</p>
         <p>And mov'd the Doctor with its squalling:</p>
         <p>But, before Heaven I can swear,</p>
         <p>It then was as a Cherub fair;</p>
         <p>Strait as a little arrow he,</p>
         <p>In perfect form and symmetry;</p>
         <p>And from its neck unto its rump,</p>
         <p>Believe me, he had no such hump</p>
         <p>As that, though hid with every care,</p>
         <p>Your injur'd form is seen to bear;</p>
         <p>And cannot but appear to be</p>
         <p>A natural deformity.</p>
         <p>How this change came of course you know,--</p>
         <p>With the poor child it was not so;--</p>
         <p>Prepare its Hist'ry to explain,</p>
         <p>Or you will visit here in vain.</p>
         <p>--My good young man, strive not to cheat,</p>
         <p>Nor think to profit by deceit:</p>
         <p>You have with knowing folk to do,</p>
         <p>Not to be foil'd by such as you.</p>
         <p>I own you tell a moving tale,</p>
         <p>But Facts alone will now prevail:</p>
         <p>You will be sifted up and down</p>
         <p>Till e'en your marrow-bones are known.</p>
         <p>--I've not another word to say;</p>
         <p>To _Master Vellum_ take your way,</p>
         <p>You'll find him at his snug abode</p>
         <p>Near _Shoreditch Church_, in _Hackney Road_:</p>
         <p>For, when the infant first was left,</p>
         <p>Of all parental care bereft,</p>
         <p>The Bookseller and I, between us,</p>
         <p>Had much to do with dear QUÆ GENUS:</p>
         <p>For to his shop I us'd to go</p>
         <p>'Twas then in _Paternoster Row_,</p>
         <p>As he the money did supply</p>
         <p>For the poor Foundling's nursery.</p>
         <p>--O, if he finds your story true, }</p>
         <p>It will, indeed, be well for you! }</p>
         <p>I will then hug and kiss you too!" }</p>
         <p>He took his leave--she gave a blessing</p>
         <p>As good, perhaps, as her caressing.</p>
         <p>In haste, and on his great intent</p>
         <p>To _Vellum_ He his footsteps bent;</p>
         <p>Who had long since left off the trade</p>
         <p>By which he had a fortune made:</p>
         <p>But why we do the old Man see</p>
         <p>A figure in this history,</p>
         <p>Becomes a duty to explain,</p>
         <p>Nor shall it be employ'd in vain:</p>
         <p>And now, as brief as can be told,</p>
         <p>We must the Mystery unfold;</p>
         <p>And, since so many years are o'er,</p>
         <p>Why it was not explain'd before.</p>
         <p>Though he who length of life has seen,</p>
         <p>Must have a cold observer been;</p>
         <p>Whose languid or incurious eye</p>
         <p>Has not the power to descry,</p>
         <p>On what a chain of odds and ends</p>
         <p>The course of Human Life depends.</p>
         <p>But now we quit the beaten road</p>
         <p>And turn into an _Episode_,</p>
         <p>Nor fear the track, though we shall draw</p>
         <p>The picture of a _Man of Law_;</p>
         <p>For we have seldom had to do</p>
         <p>With one so gen'rous, just and true;</p>
         <p>So he was thought by grateful fame,</p>
         <p>And _Fairman_ was the good man's name.</p>
         <p>If in that long-suspected trade</p>
         <p>An honest fortune e'er was made</p>
         <p>'Twas that he could in Honour boast</p>
         <p>As Justice always tax'd the cost.</p>
         <p>'Twas his to bid Contention cease</p>
         <p>And make the Law a Friend to peace:</p>
         <p>He strove to silence rising feud,</p>
         <p>And all his practice led to good:</p>
         <p>By mildest means it was his aim</p>
         <p>To silence each opposing claim;</p>
         <p>To take Injustice by the brow</p>
         <p>And make it to right reason bow:</p>
         <p>Nay, where in courts he must contend,</p>
         <p>He saw no foe, and knew no friend.</p>
         <p>He fail'd not by his utmost power</p>
         <p>To wing with speed Law's ling'ring hour;</p>
         <p>A busy foe to dull delay,</p>
         <p>He spurr'd each process on its way;</p>
         <p>Nor were his words, by skill made pliant,</p>
         <p>Arrang'd to flatter any Client:</p>
         <p>Whene'er he claim'd his well-earn'd Fee,</p>
         <p>_Justice_ and _Law_ would answer--_Yea_.</p>
         <p>And when Oppression knit its brow</p>
         <p>And said, _proceed_,--He answer'd--_No_.</p>
         <p>--When summon'd to the great _Assize_,</p>
         <p>Held in the Court above the skies,</p>
         <p>He will not be afraid to hear</p>
         <p>The VERDICT which awaits him _there_.</p>
         <p>--Such was the Man who soon would own</p>
         <p id="ca9">QUÆ GENUS as his darling Son.</p>
         <p>CANTO IX</p>
         <p>The man of pure and simple heart</p>
         <p>Through Life disdains a double part,</p>
         <p>Nor does he need a mean device</p>
         <p>His inward bosom to disguise:</p>
         <p>Thus as he stands before mankind</p>
         <p>His actions prove an honest mind.</p>
         <p>But though 'gainst Reason's rigid rule</p>
         <p>He may have play'd the early fool,</p>
         <p>As wise men may, perhaps, have done</p>
         <p>In the long race which they have run;</p>
         <p>For Passion, which will act its part</p>
         <p>In the best regulated heart,</p>
         <p>Is, as we may too often see</p>
         <p>Beset with Nature's frailty.</p>
         <p>Yet Virtue in its course prevails; }</p>
         <p>The better impulse seldom fails }</p>
         <p>When smiling Conscience holds the scales: }</p>
         <p>Nay, through the venial errors past,</p>
         <p>Maintains its influence to the last,</p>
         <p>And thus, with righteous hope endued,</p>
         <p>Rests on _predominating good_.</p>
         <p>Something like this we hope to see</p>
         <p>In our progressive History.</p>
         <p>One morn as worthy _Fairman_ lay</p>
         <p>Courting his pillow's soft delay,</p>
         <p>Enjoying, in his mind's fair view,</p>
         <p>Good he had done, or meant to do;</p>
         <p>A Letter came, as it appear'd,</p>
         <p>Sign'd by a name, he'd never heard,</p>
         <p>To beg he instant would attend</p>
         <p>An old and long-forgotten friend,</p>
         <p>Matter of import to unfold</p>
         <p>Which could by her alone be told,</p>
         <p>Whose trembling hand in Nature's spite</p>
         <p>Had strove the wretched scrawl to write.</p>
         <p>She wish'd into his ear to pour</p>
         <p>The tidings of a dying hour,</p>
         <p>Which she was anxious to impart</p>
         <p>To the recesses of his heart.</p>
         <p>This Summons the good man obey'd</p>
         <p>And found upon, a sick-bed laid,</p>
         <p>A female form, whose languid eye</p>
         <p>Seem'd to look bright when he drew nigh.</p>
         <p>--"Listen," she said, "I humbly pray,</p>
         <p>Though short the time, I've much to say.</p>
         <p>My features now no longer bear</p>
         <p>The figure when you thought them fair:</p>
         <p>MARIA was my borrow'd name }</p>
         <p>When passion shook my early claim }</p>
         <p>To woman's glory, that chaste fame }</p>
         <p>Which when once lost, no power should give,</p>
         <p>But to repent--the wish to live.</p>
         <p>A mother's lab'ring pangs I knew,</p>
         <p>And the child ow'd its life to you.</p>
         <p>Though ever gen'rous, just and kind</p>
         <p>Here doubt perplex'd your noble mind,</p>
         <p>And had dispos'd you to believe</p>
         <p>That I was false, and could deceive:</p>
         <p>But now, if solemn oaths can prove,</p>
         <p>And if my dying words can move,</p>
         <p>Should he be living, I'll make known</p>
         <p>The Babe I bore to be _your own_.</p>
         <p>Scarce was it born, but 'twas my care</p>
         <p>That you a parent's part should bear.</p>
         <p>My quiv'ring hands then wrapp'd it o'er, }</p>
         <p>I trembling plac'd it on the floor }</p>
         <p>And gave a signal at the door: }</p>
         <p>When I, my eyes bedimm'd with tears,</p>
         <p>And flurried by alarming fears,</p>
         <p>In a dark night mistook the stair</p>
         <p>And left it to a stranger's care.</p>
         <p>Such was my error, as I thought</p>
         <p>The child was harbour'd where it ought;</p>
         <p>And, O my friend, how well I knew</p>
         <p>The helpless would be safe with YOU:--</p>
         <p>And when, by secret means, I heard</p>
         <p>It was receiv'd and would be rear'd,</p>
         <p>I doubted not you did prepare</p>
         <p>The blessings of a parent's care.</p>
         <p>--I was content, and join'd the train</p>
         <p>Of warring men who cross'd the main;</p>
         <p>And since, for twenty years or more,</p>
         <p>I've follow'd Camps on India's shore;</p>
         <p>But when, how chang'd by years of pain,</p>
         <p>I saw my native land again,</p>
         <p>I look'd, how vainly, for the joy</p>
         <p>Of seeing my deserted Boy!</p>
         <p>Think how my disappointment grew, }</p>
         <p>When, from a strict research, I knew }</p>
         <p>He never had been known to you! }</p>
         <p>But, favour'd by the will of Heaven,</p>
         <p>To Mercy's hand he has been given;</p>
         <p>Though of his first or latter years</p>
         <p>No record of him yet appears:</p>
         <p>At least, beyond the earliest day</p>
         <p>As in his cot the Infant lay,</p>
         <p>And when his smiling place of rest</p>
         <p>Was on a fondling nurse's breast!</p>
         <p>I the child's story, but in vain,</p>
         <p>Have strove with anxious heart to gain;</p>
         <p>For she who gave him milk still lives</p>
         <p>And tells all that her mem'ry gives.</p>
         <p>But of your child what is become,</p>
         <p>Whether he has a house or home,</p>
         <p>Whether he sails the ocean o'er }</p>
         <p>Or wanders on some desert shore, }</p>
         <p>Whether he lives or breathes no more, }</p>
         <p>If you've the heart that once I knew</p>
         <p>May shortly be made known to you:</p>
         <p>For, with the means which you possess,</p>
         <p>He may be found your age to bless.</p>
         <p>I only ask of Heaven to live</p>
         <p>To see him your embrace receive;</p>
         <p>And, dare I hope the joy, to join</p>
         <p>A mother's fond embrace with thine:</p>
         <p>Then may my pilgrim wanderings cease,</p>
         <p>And I, at length, shall die in peace!</p>
         <p>--Thus I have my last duty done,</p>
         <p>And may kind Heaven restore your Son!--"</p>
         <p>--She spoke--the tale she did impart</p>
         <p>Sunk deep into the good man's heart;</p>
         <p>For, as he said, there did not live</p>
         <p>To close his eyes one relative.</p>
         <p>He then in eager speech declar'd</p>
         <p>No cost, no labour should be spar'd</p>
         <p>The Boy to find, and should he be</p>
         <p>What his fond eyes might wish to see,</p>
         <p>His Father's name he soon would bear,</p>
         <p>And of his fortune be the Heir.</p>
         <p>--No time was lost--what could be done,</p>
         <p>To give her ease and find her Son,</p>
         <p>Was soon employ'd in ev'ry way</p>
         <p>That public notice could display.</p>
         <p>The good man now the subject weigh'd,</p>
         <p>Then call'd in VELLUM to his aid,</p>
         <p>And did, with anxious wish commend</p>
         <p>The office to his long-known friend,</p>
         <p>To set afloat enquiry due</p>
         <p>If what MARIA told were true;</p>
         <p>Nor did he think of pains or cost</p>
         <p>To find the stray-sheep that was lost.</p>
         <p>"To you," he said, "I give the task,</p>
         <p>The greatest favour I can ask,</p>
         <p>To trace, if 'tis in any power,</p>
         <p>The _Foundling_ from that favor'd hour</p>
         <p>When DOCTOR SYNTAX first receiv'd</p>
         <p>The child and all its wants reliev'd;</p>
         <p>And you, at once, call'd in to share</p>
         <p>The wishes of his guardian care.</p>
         <p>Believe me that my high-wrought feeling,</p>
         <p>Which you must see there's no concealing,"</p>
         <p>(For the tear glisten'd in his eye,</p>
         <p>And his breast spoke the long-drawn sigh)</p>
         <p>"Disdains at once all sordid sense</p>
         <p>Which hesitates at recompence:</p>
         <p>O what would I refuse to give</p>
         <p>Should he be blest with worth and live!</p>
         <p>Indulge my whims--nor let me know }</p>
         <p>Or what you've done or what you do, }</p>
         <p>Till you can answer--_Yea_ or _No_. }</p>
         <p>Till your grave voice attests my claim</p>
         <p>To bear a parent's tender name:</p>
         <p>Nor let the claimant here be shown,</p>
         <p>Till he is prov'd to be my own."</p>
         <p>VELLUM began by exercising</p>
         <p>His well-known zeal in advertising;</p>
         <p>Nay, did, from _Kent_, to the _Land's-End_,</p>
         <p>QUÆ GENUS and his birth extend,</p>
         <p>And as the _King's Bench Walks_ had been</p>
         <p>Of his first days the curious scene,</p>
         <p>Within those environs were spread</p>
         <p>The grand _Placards_ which he had read;</p>
         <p>And did a forc'd attention call</p>
         <p>To many a window, many a wall,</p>
         <p>Whose tempting story to rehearse</p>
         <p>Has wak'd an effort in our verse.</p>
         <p>QUÆ GENUS' plain, consistent tale</p>
         <p>Seem'd with old VELLUM to prevail;</p>
         <p>And rather tallied with the view</p>
         <p>Of what, in former times, he knew:</p>
         <p>But, that same _Hump_ his shoulders bore,</p>
         <p>And oft had been his foe before,</p>
         <p>Forbad the Laundress to bestow</p>
         <p>A favouring opinion now;</p>
         <p>The want of which kept things aloof</p>
         <p>From certain and substantial proof.</p>
         <p>For though the Doctors in the North, }</p>
         <p>Men of acknowledg'd skill and worth, }</p>
         <p>Were ready to confirm on oath, }</p>
         <p>That, 'twas disease which gave the blow</p>
         <p>And bent the strait back to a bow;</p>
         <p>Yet this same Hump of direful note</p>
         <p>Still stuck in _Betty's_ doubtful throat,</p>
         <p>For all that she would say or swear</p>
         <p>Was, when the Child was in her care,</p>
         <p>To the most, keen, observing eye,</p>
         <p>His back bore no deformity;</p>
         <p>And thus continued the suspense</p>
         <p>From want of better evidence.</p>
         <p>--_Vellum_ was not without a fear,</p>
         <p>That, from the Gout's attack severe,</p>
         <p>The anxious Father's self might die</p>
         <p>Before truth clear'd the Mystery,</p>
         <p>And had, from doubt reliev'd, made known</p>
         <p>The Child as his begotten Son--</p>
         <p>Besides on his discovery bent,</p>
         <p>To _Oxford_ when kind _Vellum_ went,</p>
         <p>To seek his venerable Friend,</p>
         <p>The well-known Rev'rend DOCTOR BEND,</p>
         <p>Who would have set all matters right,</p>
         <p>He died on the preceding night.</p>
         <p>But still, as we pass on our way,</p>
         <p>What changes mark life's transient day;</p>
         <p>The sun-beams gild the o'erhanging cloud,</p>
         <p>The mists the glitt'ring rays enshroud;</p>
         <p>And, while from storms of beating rain }</p>
         <p>We strive some shelter to obtain, }</p>
         <p>The scene is chang'd--'tis bright again. }</p>
         <p>Hence 'tis we share th' uncertain hour</p>
         <p>Of joys that smile, of cares that lour.</p>
         <p>Thus, while Enquiry seem'd to wear</p>
         <p>The very aspect of Despair,</p>
         <p>A sudden instantaneous thought</p>
         <p>Was to OLD BETTY'S mem'ry brought,</p>
         <p>That a _Ripe_ STRAWBERRY, blushing red,</p>
         <p>As it grew on its verdant bed,</p>
         <p>By Nature's whimsey, was impress'd</p>
         <p>Not on the cheek or on the breast</p>
         <p>But _Betty_ said, "'Tis I know where, }</p>
         <p>And could I once but see it there, }</p>
         <p>On Bible Book, ay, I would swear, }</p>
         <p>The young man is the child who left,</p>
         <p>And, of a mother's care bereft,</p>
         <p>Was by the Doctor given to me</p>
         <p>To nurse his tender Infancy."</p>
         <p>--QUÆ GENUS now was call'd to tell</p>
         <p>What he knew of this secret spell.</p>
         <p>When he without delay declar'd</p>
         <p>What of the mark he oft had heard</p>
         <p>By gamesome play-fellows at school</p>
         <p>When he was bathing in the pool;</p>
         <p>And though he sometimes strove to feel it,</p>
         <p>Its strange position did conceal it</p>
         <p>From his own eyes, though, as a joke,</p>
         <p>It often did a laugh provoke.</p>
         <p>Then did he to her wish display,</p>
         <p>What the verse hides from open day;</p>
         <p>But _Betty Broom_ was not so shy }</p>
         <p>To turn away her curious eye }</p>
         <p>From this same blushing STRAWBERRY. }</p>
         <p>Nay, when she saw the mark, she swore</p>
         <p>She oft had kiss'd it o'er and o'er;</p>
         <p>And, were he not to manhood grown,</p>
         <p>She'd do what she so oft had done.</p>
         <p>O she exclaim'd with tears of joy,</p>
         <p>QUÆ GENUS is the very boy</p>
         <p>Whom their so anxious wishes sought</p>
         <p>And was to full discovery brought.</p>
         <p>--Nor was this all, at the strange show</p>
         <p>Old VELLUM wip'd his moisten'd brow,</p>
         <p>And said, with an uplifted eye,</p>
         <p>"Here ends this curious Mystery."</p>
         <p>When he again, the Symbol saw</p>
         <p>In its right place without a flaw,</p>
         <p>At once he did remember well,</p>
         <p>SYNTAX would smiling oft foretell,</p>
         <p>This mark might to _the Foundling_ show</p>
         <p>To whom he did existence owe.</p>
         <p>"'Tis all fulfill'd, the proof is shewn,--</p>
         <p>The FATHER may embrace _his Son_!"</p>
         <p>As _Vellum_, thought another hour</p>
         <p>Should not delay that darling power</p>
         <p>He to his friend's impatient ear</p>
         <p>In all due substance did declare</p>
         <p>The Hist'ry of QUÆ GENUS past,</p>
         <p>With all the proofs from first to last,</p>
         <p>As on his own conviction shone</p>
         <p>That he was truly _Fairman's_ Son:</p>
         <p>When the good man, with brighten'd eye,</p>
         <p>And the heart's tend'rest sympathy,</p>
         <p>As he look'd upwards thus express'd</p>
         <p>The joy that revell'd in his breast.</p>
         <p>"From all I've heard and you have shown</p>
         <p>With zeal and friendship rarely known,</p>
         <p>To the fond truth I'm reconcil'd</p>
         <p>That poor QUÆ GENUS is my Child,</p>
         <p>Confirm'd by all his Mother said,</p>
         <p>As I sat by her dying bed;</p>
         <p>And ere another sun shall shine,</p>
         <p>I'll prove, at least, I think him mine,</p>
         <p>By giving him a rightful claim</p>
         <p>To share my fortune and my name.</p>
         <p>You then, my friend, may bring him here,</p>
         <p>'Tis a strange task, but do not fear,</p>
         <p>At this so unexpected hour,</p>
         <p>My firmness will relax its power,--</p>
         <p>Though I'm beneath a certain course</p>
         <p>Of medicine, of promis'd force</p>
         <p>On which I have a firm reliance</p>
         <p>To bid the tort'ring Gout defiance,</p>
         <p>My vig'rous spirits will sustain</p>
         <p>The shock of joy as well as pain."</p>
         <p>--_Vellum_, with pleasure now withdrew</p>
         <p>To shape the approaching Interview,--</p>
         <p>And suit QUÆ GENUS to a change:</p>
         <p>So unexpected and so strange;</p>
         <p>But how can we relate the scene</p>
         <p>That is about to intervene</p>
         <p>Where we shall see in different parts</p>
         <p>The weeping eyes, the melting hearts,</p>
         <p>Affection's warm and yielding sense</p>
         <p>And looks of cold indifference,</p>
         <p>While Reason yields, with ample fee,</p>
         <p>To be the dupe of Quackery.</p>
         <p>This to describe with all the rest</p>
         <p>The verse, we trust, will do its best;</p>
         <p>But if the labour it refuses</p>
         <p>We'll scout OLD POLL and his NINE MUSES,</p>
         <p>And leave our JOHN TROT lines to tell</p>
         <p>The Story and, we hope, as well.</p>
         <p>An _Empiric_ had hither bent</p>
         <p>His journey from the Continent,</p>
         <p>Who boasted, by his Chymic skill,</p>
         <p>Disease was subject to his will;</p>
         <p>And that his cunning had found out</p>
         <p>A _Panacea_ for the _Gout_.</p>
         <p>It seems this wonderful receipt</p>
         <p>Form'd a warm-bath for legs and feet;</p>
         <p>And ev'ry day, for a full hour,</p>
         <p>The period might be less or more,</p>
         <p>The Patient sat, but ill at ease</p>
         <p>His legs immers'd up to his knees,</p>
         <p>Each in a pail just plac'd before him</p>
         <p>Fill'd with a fluid to restore him.</p>
         <p>_Fairman_, who dup'd by Quack'ry's lures,</p>
         <p>Had often sought for promis'd cures</p>
         <p>Thought it would be no harm to try</p>
         <p>The efforts of this Remedy.</p>
         <p>--But _Vellum_ eager to make known</p>
         <p>This curious pair as SIRE and SON.</p>
         <p>Did not consult his better reason</p>
         <p>Respecting the right place and season,</p>
         <p>But a most heedless moment sought</p>
         <p>When he QUÆ GENUS trembling brought,</p>
         <p>While the Old Man up to his knees</p>
         <p>Was bathing for expected ease,</p>
         <p>And thought of nothing but the ails</p>
         <p>He hop'd to drown within the pails.</p>
         <p>Then _Vellum_ said, my Duty's done</p>
         <p>Behold, my friend and see your Son!</p>
         <p>QUÆ GENUS, kneeling on the floor,</p>
         <p>Began a blessing to implore!</p>
         <p>The good man said, I ask of Heaven</p>
         <p>That its protection may be given</p>
         <p>To this my long-lost, darling Boy</p>
         <p>Of coming time my only joy!</p>
         <p>'Twas then he press'd the frizzled hair</p>
         <p>And sunk back senseless in his chair.</p>
         <p>The good old _Bookseller_ amaz'd</p>
         <p>On the strange, motley picture gaz'd,</p>
         <p>And _Betty Broom_ began to vow</p>
         <p>"'Twere pity he should die just now."</p>
         <p>While the staid Cook, whose ev'ry feature</p>
         <p>Scarce knew a change from sober nature,</p>
         <p>Was to expression ne'er beguil'd,</p>
         <p>Who never wept nor ever smil'd</p>
         <p>Then calmly said, but said no more,</p>
         <p>"I never saw him so before:"--</p>
         <p>While, "look! behold! see he revives!"</p>
         <p>QUÆ GENUS cried--"my Father lives!"</p>
         <p>Wonder and Gratitude and Fainting</p>
         <p>Were there combin'd--what could be wanting</p>
         <p>To make the melting scene complete,</p>
         <p>But coffin and a winding-sheet?</p>
         <p>Nor were those symbols long to seek,</p>
         <p>For, in a short and happy week,</p>
         <p>Which was in warm affection past,</p>
         <p id="jqg23">The exulting Father breath'd his last.</p>
         <p>[Illustration: QUÆ GENUS DISCOVERS HIS FATHER.]</p>
         <p>Here then we make a pause to ask</p>
         <p>How Fortune will achieve its task,</p>
         <p>And, to indulge the curious view,</p>
         <p>What track the Fancy must pursue,</p>
         <p>From such a change in the affairs</p>
         <p>Of the poor Foundling on the stairs.</p>
         <p>Whether the passions active strife</p>
         <p>Will check repose and trouble life;</p>
         <p>Whether the inmate of his breast</p>
         <p>Will lead to turbulence or rest,</p>
         <p>Make him repose beneath the shade</p>
         <p>At ease and indolently laid;</p>
         <p>Whether the mind will yield to pleasure</p>
         <p>In that seducing form and measure,</p>
         <p>Which strews temptations ev'ry hour</p>
         <p>And gold commands with ready power:</p>
         <p>--But other notions we had brought</p>
         <p>The proofs of our prophetic thought;</p>
         <p>That, not without a gleam of pride,</p>
         <p>He would chuse Reason for his guide.</p>
         <p>When with a plenteous income arm'd</p>
         <p>And hospitable bosom warm'd,</p>
         <p>He from the gay world would retire</p>
         <p>And turn into a Country 'Squire;</p>
         <p>Then, with those charms which heighten life,</p>
         <p>And blossom in a pleasing wife,</p>
         <p>Enjoy that calm and tranquil state }</p>
         <p>That does on Independence wait, }</p>
         <p>Nor spurns the low, nor courts the great: }</p>
         <p>And though not from those frailties free</p>
         <p>The Lot of man's infirmity,</p>
         <p>He might pass on to rev'rend age,</p>
         <p>And die a Christian and a sage.</p>
         <p>--Thus we our Hero's picture drew</p>
         <p>As hope inspir'd, for future view,</p>
         <p>Such as the coming years might see,</p>
         <p>Such as we hop'd that he would be.</p>
         <p>But soon appear'd a threat'ning storm</p>
         <p>That did the expected scene deform,</p>
         <p>And many a cloud began to lour</p>
         <p>That veils the intellectual hour,</p>
         <p>Though gleams of light would oft controul</p>
         <p>The darksome chaos of the soul:</p>
         <p>And a bright, instantaneous ray</p>
         <p>Would gild a cloud and chear the day;</p>
         <p>And now and then a serious thought</p>
         <p>Was to its proper object brought.</p>
         <p>Whene'er, oppress'd with sudden gloom,</p>
         <p>In solemn steps he pac'd the room;</p>
         <p>Then, his looks beaming with content,</p>
         <p>He turn'd to Joy and Merriment,</p>
         <p>And Reason, for a wav'ring hour,</p>
         <p>Would seem to re-assume its power.</p>
         <p>Yet social habits he disclaim'd,</p>
         <p>Wept when he prais'd, laugh'd when he blam'd,</p>
         <p>And, sometimes frowning, would declare</p>
         <p>Life was not worth the liver's care.</p>
         <p>--Whether it was the sudden change,</p>
         <p>So unexpected and so strange,</p>
         <p>Or the accession large of wealth</p>
         <p>Broke in upon his reason's health,</p>
         <p>Or the concussion of his brain }</p>
         <p>Which the night's frolic did sustain, }</p>
         <p>Our science knows not to explain. }</p>
         <p>Old _Betty_ thought it must be Love,</p>
         <p>Which she would undertake to prove,</p>
         <p>As in his freaks that seem'd like folly</p>
         <p>He sung and danc'd and talk'd of _Molly_,</p>
         <p>And frequently was seen to scrawl</p>
         <p>Figures in chalk upon the wall,</p>
         <p>Then fancy that he scatter'd flowers</p>
         <p>And sat in gay and fragrant bowers.</p>
         <p>--Whate'er the hidden cause might be, }</p>
         <p>No sage experience could foresee }</p>
         <p>A cure for his Infirmity. }</p>
         <p>He now grew worse from day to day,</p>
         <p>And Nature hasten'd to decay:</p>
         <p>It soon was seen, no art could save</p>
         <p>QUÆ GENUS from an early grave.</p>
         <p>--Old _Vellum_ did not quit his care</p>
         <p>And _Betty Broom_ was always there.</p>
         <p>The FOUNDLING'S Life she had attended,</p>
         <p>As it began, and as it ended:</p>
         <p>His earliest days her cares embrac'd,</p>
         <p>Her aged eyes wept o'er his last:</p>
         <p>They did his dying hour behold!</p>
