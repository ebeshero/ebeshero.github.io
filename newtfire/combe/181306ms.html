         <p><span>So numerous are my correspondents, that if I had not determined to take them
               according to the date of their arrival, I should be in a state of continual
               perplexity. Nay, as it is, if <span class="persName">Mr. Ackermann</span> was to
               publish his admirable miscellany every week, instead of every month, it would be
               regularly supplied with such productions as mine. </span></p>
         <p><span>As a man of humanity, and impressed with the love of my fellow-creatures, which I
               profess myself to be, I cannot but feel a very sensible mortification, that so many
               persons address thenselves [sic] to me in the language of complaint, and, as far as I
               can judge, without any just cause of lamentation: I mean, as rational, reflecting,
               consistent beings, who must know that life is a chequered state; that trouble is a
               part of our allotment; that the day of our existence is shaded with clouds as it is
               brightened with sunshine, and that to bear with fortitude and resignation the pains
               and sorrows to which we are subject, is a duty that religion enjoins, and which the
               just Being who, for wise purposes, inflicted them upon us, will finally reward. But
               the complaints which reach me, are many of them so trivial, that they rather dispose
               me to laughter than commiseration </span></p>
         <p><span>A gentleman writes me word, that he has a very susceptible heart; that he is
               continually under the influence of the tender passion, and wishes, above all things,
               to unite himself in the hymeneal bonds with some lady whose charms, accomplishments,
               and disposition, may combine to render his life happy. He knows, according to his own
               account, several charming young women who answer this description, and who would
               probably yield to his solicitations, if he had it in his power clearly to express
               them; but, from some bad habit contracted when a child, or perhaps an original defect
               in the organs of speech, he cannot tell a lady that he <span class="emph"
                  >loves</span> her, or that she is lovely. In short, he cannot, without extreme
               difficulty, agitation, and grimace, pronounce any word that begins with, or
               comprehends the letter L. Thus, he is so long in saying to any attractive fair on, I
               l-o-o-o-o-o-ve you, and accompanies the declaration with such sputtering and
               distortion of features, that the lady is ready to die with confusion or with
               laughter, before he has concluded his declaration: nay, sometimes he has himself been
               so overcome, as not, after all, to give the word utterance, without a sudden
               projecting motion of the head at the close, that threatens violence to the person he
               addresses, and which actually did, on one occasion, produce a bloody nose in a very
               pretty face, the owner of which has ever since denominated him, <span class="emph"
                  >Raw Head and Bloody Bones</span>. </span></p>
         <p><span>It is certainly a most unfortunate defect in a man who is always in love, not to
               be able to pronounce the name of the passion which seems to be the main-spring of his
               actions, and on the gratification of which his happiness depends. There appear to be
               only two ways left for him, by which he can proceed: the one, by writing; and the
               other, by dumb show or pantomime; and it appears that he has tried them both without
               success. The first letter he wrote on this important subject, was worked up in all
               the strength of expression which the violence of his passion might urge him to
               employ. But the lady refused to listen to a declaration of love, which the gentleman
               who made it could not utter. She also added, that, with his infirmity, the lady who
               married him would be under the painful necessity of having all the talk to herself; a
               circumstance which the whole sex are known to abominate. His next trial was in verse;
               and he flattered himself, that poetry might be more favourable to him than prose. But
               here again he was unfortunate; for the fair one to whom he addressed himself,
               insisted upon it, that neither the Muses nor Cupid could consider him as their
               votary, or they would have contrived to untie his tongue for him. As for his dumb
               show, he is still more unsuccessful in that than in his attempts which have been just
               described. He had taken lessons, it seems, of some actor of consideration, who had
               taught him to employ every look and posture declaratory of the tender passion. He had
               been taught to sigh, to put on the mist piteous looks, to place his hands on his
               bosom, to kneel, and display and very posture of entreaty. But the first time he put
               this design in execution, the lady thought he had suddenly lost his senses, and
               expressed her alarms by such screams and shrieks, as called the whole family to her
               assistance. What is to be done for this poor gentleman, I am really at a loss to
               conceive. He has but a choice of evils; and nothing is left for him, but to find out
               some pleasing, agreeable woman, who is as deaf as a post; or an interesting young
               person, who has the same impediment as himself. In the former case, he may convey his
               ideas with his fingers, which will not stammer; and, in the latter, the happy couple
               will at least have a mutual sympathy; and if they cannot amuse each other by their
               conversation, they will be sure to be infinitely entertaining to every company which
               they may frequent. </span></p>
         <p><span>I am sorry to find, that I have at least a score of complaints from wives, of
               their husbands; and but one solitary declaration of discontent of a husband,
               respecting the conduct of his wife. One lady is extremely angry with her hymeneal
               companion, as she calls him, for being always from home, and leaving her to the
               dullness of her own melancholy society. While another is equally dissatisfied, that
               the master of her house, as she chuses to express herself, is never out of it, but in
               attendance upon her. She thought the other day, that she had contrived an agreeable
               absence, by a visit, for a short time, in an aguish situation in the country, where
               she was certain, as he is very careful of his health, that he would not accompany
               her. But he took a post-chaise secretly, and went another way, in order to afford her
               an agreeable surprise; so that, when she arrived at her journey’s end, she found,
                  <span class="emph">pour comble de bonheur, son cher mari</span> ready to receive
               her. She positively declares, that, if he continues to worry her in this manner she
               will do something or other to procure a divorce, and get rid of him for ever.
            </span></p>
         <p><span>There is no end to the accounts I have of domestic discontents, from the
               grandfather to the hundredth cousin; and in many of them there may be some cause of
               complaint. I only wish that I could discern, here and there, some well regulated mode
               of conduct and management, under these inconveniences, from which our condition is
               inseparable. But it really moves me from all moderation of temper, when I receive
               lamentations that could only be justified by the most aggravated calamities, on
               subjects not only trivial and ridiculous, but absolutely disgraceful. </span></p>
         <p><span><span class="persName">Miss Flirtilla Simper</span> complains of the cruelty of
               her mamma, for ordering her new dress to be jonquil and lilac, when she knew that her
               heart was set upon maiden’s blush. </span></p>
         <p><span>A lady, who has lately lost the best husband that ever woman possessed, and who,
               since his death, has never been able to get a moment’s sleep for thinking on him,
               till three or four o’clock in the morning, complains, in the bitterest terms, of a
                  <span class="emph">devilish</span>blackbird, belonging to some one in the
               neighbourhood, which about that hour begins his <span class="emph">infernal
                  schritching</span>, to the destruction of the only insensibility in which she can
               lose her griefs. Another complains of her being the peculiar object of ill-fortune.
               It seems, she says, as if every barbed arrow in the quiver of fate were to be
               discharged at her. She had lost three children and their fond father in the course of
               seven years. Scarce had she dried up her tears for the death of one, than they were
               called to flow another; and now, when her spirit had been brought into a placid state
               resignation, a new wound had been suddenly opened by the death of her two little
               darling parroquets, who died in the course of one night, and have left her perfectly
               disconsolate. There is a florist too, who complains, that, during the last two
               seasons, the weather has been altogether unfavourable to his shew of carnations, and
               that the sun, which shines upon all, exercises a malignant influence upon him.
            </span></p>
         <p><span>I shall conclude my catalogue of complainers with the enraged disappointments of a
               virtuoso, who, by accidentally slipping on a piece of orange-peel in the street, fell
               into the kennel; and, in consequence of being obliged to go into a coffee-house, to
               get himself cleaned and rubbed down, he came too late to a sale, and lost the
               purchase of a shell, which he had been hunting after for several years. </span></p>
         <p><span>It would be endless to enumerate the many fantastical afflictions that disturb
               mankind; but as a misery is not to be measured from the nature of the evil, but from
               the temper of the sufferer, I shall present my readers, who are unhappy in
               imagination, with the following allegory, for their instruction and amusement.
            </span></p>
         <p><span>When Jupiter took into his hands the government of the world, the several parts of
               nature, with the presiding deities, did homage to him. One presented him with a
               mountain of winds, another with a magazine of hail, and a third with a pile of
               thunderbolts. The stars offered up their influences, the ocean gave in his trident,
               the earth her fruits, and the sun his seasons. Among the several deities who came to
               make their court on the occasion, the Destinies advanced, with two great tuns carried
               before them, one of which they placed on the right hand of Jove’s throne, and the
               other on its left. The first was filled with all the blessings, the other with all
               the calamities of human life. Jupiter in the beginning of his reign, finding the
               world much more innocent than it is in this iron age, poured very plentifully out of
               the tun on his right hand; but as mankind degenerated, and became unworthy of his
               blessings, he set abroach the other vessel, that filled them with pain and poverty,
               battles and distempers, jealousy and false hood, intoxicating pleasures and untimely
               deaths. </span></p>
         <p><span>He was, at length, so greatly incensed at the increasing depravations of human
               nature, and the repeated provocations he received from all parts of the earth, that
               he commanded the Destinies to gather up the blessings which he had thrown away upon
               mankind, and lay them up until the world should be inhabited by a more virtuous and
               deserving race of mortals. The three sisters immediately repaired to the earth, in
               search of the several blessings that have been scattered on it; but found the task
               enjoined on them much more difficult than they had imagined. The first places to
               which they resorted, were, cities, palaces, and courts; but instead of meeting what
               they looked for here, they found nothing but envy, repining, uneasiness, and the
               bitter ingredients of the vessel on the left hand; while they found the substantial
               blessings of life in situations of tranquility and retirement. They observed, also,
               that several blessings had degenerated into calamities; and various calamities had
               improved into blessings, according as they fell into the possession of wise or
               foolish men. They often found power with so much insolence and impatience cleaving to
               it, that it became a misfortune to the person on whom it was conferred. Youth had
               often distempers growing about it, worse than the infirmities of old age; wealth was
               often united to such a sordid avarice, as made it the most uncomfortable and painful
               kind of poverty; and industry itself, by directing its efforts in wrong channels, had
               no better gains than those of idleness. On the contrary, they often found pain made
               glorious by fortitude, poverty lost in content, and deformity beautified with virtue.
               In short, the blessings were often, like good fruits, planted in a bad soil, that, by
               degrees, fall off from their natural flavor into tastes altogether insipid; and the
               calamities, like harsh fruits cultivated in a good soil, until they acquire delicious
               juices. </span></p>
         <p><span>There was still a third circumstance, that occasioned as great a surprise to the
               three sisters, as either of the foregoing; when they discovered several blessings and
               calamities which had never been in either of the tuns that stood by the side of
               Jupiter; and were, nevertheless, as great occasions of happiness or misery as any
               there. These were, that spurious crop of blessings and calamities which were never
               sown by the hand of the deity, but grow of themselves, out of the fancies and
               dispositions of human creatures: such are, dress, titles, place. Equipage, groundless
               fear, and all the vain imaginations that shoot up in trifling, weak, and irresolute
               minds. </span></p>
         <p><span>At length, the Destinies, finding themselves in so perplexed a state, concluded,
               that it would be impossible for them to execute the commands which had been given
               them, according to their first intention; for which reason, they agreed to throw all
               the blessings and calamities together into one large vessel, and in that manner offer
               them up at the feet of Jupiter. This was performed accordingly; when the elder of the
               sisters addressed the deity in the following manner: </span></p>
         <p><span>”O Jupiter, we have gathered together all the good and evil, the comforts and
               distresses of human life; which we thus present before thee, in one promiscuous heap.
               We beseech thee, that thou thyself will sort them out for the future, as in thy
               wisdom thou shalt think fit; for we acknowledge, that there is no power besides
               thine, that can judge what will occasion grief or joy in the heart of a human
               creature, and what will prove a blessing or a calamity to the person on whom it is
               bestowed.” </span></p>
         <p><span>A stanza from <span class="persName">Spenser</span>, shall conclude my subject:
            </span></p>
         <p><span>In vaine, thou, said old <span class="persName">Melibee</span>, doe men
            </span></p>
         <p><span>The heavens of their fortune’s fault accuse;</span></p>
         <p><span>Sith they know best, what is the best for them</span></p>
         <p><span>For, they to each such fortune doe diffuse,</span></p>
         <p><span>As they do knowe each can most aptly use.</span></p>
         <p><span>For, not that, which men covet most, is best</span></p>
         <p><span>Nor that thing worst, which men doe most refuse;</span></p>
         <p><span>But fittest is, that all contented rest</span></p>
         <p><span>With what they hold – each has his fortune in his breast.</span></p>
