         <p>LETTER II.</p>
         <p><span class="letter"><span class="opener"><span class="emph">My dear &amp; ever honoured
                     Mother</span>, </span></span></p>
         <p><span class="letter">That you are so perfectly satisfied with my last letter, gives me
               additional spirits to begin another; and though I have waited for your short, but
               delightful answer, to write in form, I have not passed a day, or rather a night (for
               it is a part of the latter season which I ever dedicate to you), without preparing
               materials for the paper which is now before me. </span></p>
         <p><span class="letter">I must confess that I have not been so surprised, delighted, or
               instructed, as I expected to be, on my entering upon the novel scene of a town life:
               and here I cannot but admire, as I am sure I have every reason to bless that
               anticipating skill, by which you prepared me for the gaieties, the pleasures, and the
               splendour of the world. You certainly employed all your maternal sagacity to instil
               into my mind, but without my perceiving it, that preparatory knowledge, which, though
               it may have deprived me of such petty, transient pleasures as arise from mere
               novelty, has greatly lessened the number of those dangers to which inexperience, and
               particularly female inexperience, is so liable, on such an entrance into the world
               (for I must use the fashionable expression) as mine. </span></p>
         <p><span class="letter">I am like a person who, before he sets out on his travels, has
               studied the geography of the countries through which he is to pass, and made himself
               acquainted with the language, manners, and customs of their inhabitants. The
               advantages of such previous knowledge must be obvious to the least reflection on the
               subject: and if it is so useful to a man who is, in some measure, already prepared,
               by the structure of his frame, the natural condition of his mind, the ordinary course
               of his education, and the early habits of his life, to pass into other regions and to
               seek other climes, how much must the utility be increased, if I may proceed in my
               comparison, when the youthful female is about to leave the fostering tenderness of
               maternal care, and to pass the guiltless limits of a native home for the other
               hemisphere of life, into which so many appear to enter without any preparation but
               the exterior accomplishments of the rank to which they belong, or any other notion of
               it but such as is derived from the fallacious representations of a foreign governess
               or an artful waiting-maid! Hence it is, that, with a baby sort of eagerness and
               curiosity, they fly to glare and glitter; catch at every toy in the shew-glass of
               dissipation; scarce weigh any thing as a good or an evil but in the balances of the
                  <span class="emph">ton</span>; marry merely for a title or a fortune; and, to make
               worse of it, become miserable for life. But while the young may be reasonably pitied
               who are brought up, as it were, in error, and are taught to amble along the flowery
               path without being told whither it ay lead, or, at least, so told, as to leave no
               salutary impression, what sentiments are to be entertained of their conduct, whom
               experience and long usage of the world should have taught better; who should not only
               feel it a pleasure, but consider it as a duty, to guide the young adventurers in the
               right way, or point out the evils which so often lurk and hide their serpent trains
               beneath the flowers on which they tread; what, I say, is to be said of those
               fashionable veterans, who are so often seen to smile at follies while they are
               growing into faulty habits, and, as it were, countenancing errors to the very moment
               that they are becoming vices? and then the reflection is dismissed at once with a
               significant shrug, and an exclamation of--"Who would have thought it!" You, my dear
               mother, were I by your side, would, I doubt not, render the conduct of such persons
               intelligible to me; but I can only attribute it to a depravity of the mind, to an
               insensibility of the heart, or having themselves, from accidental circumstances,
               passed down the stream of time without encountering the shoals, they are content to
               leave those who come after them, to pursue the same course, and to the chance of the
               same lucky fortune. </span></p>
         <p><span class="letter">You will be pleased not to imagine that these remarks are a sample
               of my natural sagacity and unassisted spirit of observation; for though you taught me
               caution, you guarded me against suspicion: they were absolutely forced upon me, and
               you shall have the history of them. </span></p>
         <p><span class="letter">On Wednesday morning I accompanied my aunt and Mrs. W <span
                  class="longdash">-----</span> to an exhibition of pictures, where we met Mr. T
                  <span class="longdash">-----</span>, who has called two or three times in <span
                  class="longdash">-----</span> Square since I have been an inhabitant of it. He is
               a man of very amiable manners, and is in high estimation for his learning and
               knowledge of the fine arts: he had the goodness to point out to me some of the best
               pictures; and was explaining their particular beauties, and the characters of their
               respective masters, when the room became so crowded as to put an end to his very
               pleasing and profitable lecture. In the evening we met him again at Lady B<span
                  class="longdash">-----</span>'s party, when he drew a chair behind mine, and
               renewed the subject of the morning, which he rendered extremely interesting, not only
               by the perspicuous and instructive manner in which he treated it, but by a most
               animated attack on Bonaparte, which he connected with it. He accused him of having
               torn down the finest picture of the first masters from the very situations in the
               churches, and other public edifices, in Rome and other places, for which those
               celebrated artists had expressly painted and adapted them, in order to misplace them
               in that abominable depository of stolen goods, the gallery of the Louvre, where, he
               added, they are so disposed, that, besides the injury which many of them have
               sustained from their removal, they are seen in such unfavourable lights, as to lose a
               very large portion of their beauties. I cannot recollect the names, but Mr. T<span
                  class="longdash">-----</span> mentioned, with uncommon feeling, the fate of a very
               favourite picture of his, on which he had so often gazed with little less than
               rapture, in some church, I think it was, in Florence. This divine painting, as he
               called it, representing the Holy Virgin and child, before which so many pious knees
               had, for a long succession of years, been daily bent; which so many artists had
               studied, and none could rival; which had received, from the foreign visitors of all
               countries, the tribute of admiration; nay, which the great master himself had painted
               for that particular alter, and had presented as a gift to the church of his patron
               saint, as an offering of his piety; this picture has actually been transferred to the
               profane purpose of decorating the dressing-room of Madam Bonaparte. You will readily
               imagine, my dearest mother, the energetic manner in which Mr. T<span class="longdash"
                  >-----</span> delivered himself on the occasion; nor will you be at a loss to
               conceive with what attentive silence your daughter sat to hear him. And now for the
               conclusion:--The gentleman had no sooner left me than I felt the tap of a fan on my
               shoulder; and on turning round, a certain elderly lady, one of that species whom Lady
               Elizabeth calls tabby-cats, was there, to say, in a half whisper, "I have been
               observing you, young lady, for some time, and I desire you will not encourage that
               self same Mr. T<span class="longdash">-----</span> to make love to you; for though he
               may be a very sensible and clever kind of a man, he has not, to my knowledge, above
               twelve or fifteen hundred pounds a year; and that you know, my dear, will not do for
               you." And before I could explain myself, off she hobbled. The poor old lady had
               fancied that all Mr. T<span class="longdash">-----</span>'s lamentation over a
               forlorn picture, was a plaintive love-tale to your happy daughter. I could not help
               smiling at this intermeddling mistake; and I verily believe, if Lady Elizabeth had
               been there to have received that communication, I should have made an hearty laugh of
               it. But this is not all. </span></p>
         <p><span class="letter">I had scarcely recovered from my surprise, when I found another
               beau had taken possession of the chair which Mr. T<span class="longdash">-----</span>
               had so lately occupied: it was no less a personage, I assure you, than the
               fashionable Mr. N. After suppressing a yawn, he made some very general, common-place,
               unmeaning observations on the opera; glanced an opinion of some of the performers;
               hinted an admiration at the dancing of Vestris; and after complaining of the dire
               length of winter, and declaring he languished for a vernal squeeze in
               Kensington-gardens, he condescended to make a few observations on the company: with
               all of which I chimed in with a complaisant yes or no, as respectively suited them:
               when, after at least five minutes of silence, and a solemn contemplation, as it
               appeared to me, of his feet, asked me if I did not think his shoes possessed an
               uncommon brilliance? The question was rather unexpected, I must own; but fortunately
               for my credit and character, I answered that they had so fine a gloss, I could almost
               suppose they were satin. This reply of mine operated on the gentleman like an
               electrical stroke, and seemed to rouse him at once into an active consciousness of
               existence: his eyes brightened, his countenance glowed, his voice assumed a new tone,
               and he proceeded to explain to me the lustre of his feet. It was produced--by what,
               think you, my dearest mother? I think you will laugh till you cry again,--why, by the
               curious composition of his blacking; which instead of being compounded of common
               ingredients and vulgar oils, is indebted, for its consistency and superior polish, to
               the jellies and jams of the finest fruits. I literally repeat his very words. He
               added, that half the young men of fashion in town had striven in vain to equal him in
               this essential article of dress; nay, that some of them had offered very high bribes
               to his servant to betray the receipt; but that he still walked the streets of London
               in boots, and trod every fashionable carpet in shoes of unrivalled lustre. With this
               proud piece of information he left me, looking at his feet as he walked off, till the
               crowd of the room prevented him from indulging in the gaze of those interesting
               objects. I have gained, also, some additional lustre on the occasion; for, in the
               course of the evening, he observed to several people, some of whom communicated the
               flattering unction to me, that I was a very fine, elegant, sensible girl. In a very
               few minutes, however, I had another tap on my shoulder from the same fan as before;
               and the same kind old lady whispered to me, that I might let that young man make love
               to me as long as I pleased, for that he had twelve thousand pounds a year.
            </span></p>
         <p><span class="letter">Thus, my dearest mother, was your Amelia supposed to be seriously
               admired by one gentleman, who was in love with the picture of a Madonna, and by
               another who was enamoured of his boots and shoes; but you will believe me, when I
               assure you, that were I compelled to marry one or the other, I should prefer good
               sense with twelve hundred a-year, to tonish folly with twelve thousand: the former,
               at least, might happily fancy that I bore some resemblance to a favourite picture,
               and become fond of me; while the latter might want to japan me, or be disposed to
               make a footstool of me; and that is a submission against which, will all my wishes to
               be a dutiful wife, you will encourage me to enter a formal protest. </span></p>
         <p><span class="letter">Such is the origin of those sage remarks with which I commenced
               this letter; and I conclude it, my dear and ever honoured mother, with the assurance
               that I am still your most affectionate, dutiful, and unaltered </span></p>
