                  </div>
                  <p><span> It may, I believe, be said with great truth, that no one was ever
                              engaged in the bustle and business of life, who did not look to some
                              future period, with a satisfactory expectation, when he should retire
                              from its cares and anxieties to the enjoyment of peace and
                              tranquillity. But of the numbers who have entertained such pleasing
                              hopes, the greater part have not, I fear, obtained the flattering
                              object. Misfortune too often renders the design abortive; infirmities
                              frequently annihilate the desire of enjoying it; while worldly
                              interests and rooted habits detain no small portion of them from
                              carrying their purpose into execution, till the hour arrives when the
                              landscape of life is fading before them. But this is not all:—-how few
                              of those who live to accomplish the project, find it a scene of
                              contentment! </span></p>
                  <p><span>A man who retires from the active concerns of life, must carry something
                              more along with him, than the money sufficient to purchase the
                              accommodations which he had fancied would give all the agreeableness
                              he expected from his new situation. He must take a mind stored with
                              something more than a sense of his prosperity, or a recollection of
                              the fortunate circumstances and active industry which combined to
                              acquire it. When the change is so great, as to be from the anxious
                              occupation of every moment to the having nothing to do, from full
                              employment to vacant hours, there must be some preparatory power to
                              preserve the mind, not merely from listlessness, but, I might almost
                              say, from misery; and that such precious attainments are not always
                              possessed by those who have been the fabricators of their own
                              fortunes, especially when trade and commerce have formed the scene of
                              their activity, no one, I believe, will venture to controvert. Rural
                              occupations, country society, and provincial duties, differ so much
                              from their accustomed habits and pursuits, that they do not readily
                              enjoy the one, as they are very rarely, if ever, qualified to perform
                              the other. </span></p>
                  <p><span>It may be also observed, that those who have been accustomed to live
                              altogether in the metropolis, and have, consequently, formed their
                              notions of life from the manners and occupations of its inhabitants,
                              are disposed to make pleasing pictures, in their own minds, of the
                              tranquil enjoyments and amiable simplicity of those who have always
                              lived in the country, which a practical experience of them will soon
                              destroy. The vices which disgrace the human character, and the
                              passions that disturb it, though they may appear in a new and less
                              prominent state, will be found sufficient, in the remotest village, to
                              disperse the fancied dreams of rural virtue and pastoral innocence.
                        </span></p>
                  <p><span>These thoughts have been suggested by a letter which I have received from
                              the country, and which I shall, without any further observation,
                              present to my readers. </span></p>
                  <div class="letter">
                        <p><span class="letter">TO THE MODERN SPECTATOR. Sir, </span></p>
                        <p><span class="letter">As you have invited correspondents, I beg leave to
                                    become one of them. The history of my perplexities may not
                                    perhaps be unamusing; as, had they happened to another, they
                                    would probably have been entertaining to myself. </span></p>
                        <p><span class="letter">A life of commercial business had confined me to
                                          <span class="placeName">London</span> and its immediate
                                    vicinity, till, by the death of a very wealthy relation, I found
                                    myself in possession of a fortune, which set me above the desire
                                    of making any addition to it; and determined me to get rid of
                                    all my trading concerns, in order that I might pass the rest of
                                    my days in the enjoyment of every rational pleasure that my
                                    added riches could procure me. </span></p>
                        <p><span class="letter">In the occasional intervals of business, I had
                                    frequently felt an anxious desire to see the distant parts of
                                          <span class="placeName">England</span>; and had, from year
                                    to year, intended to accept the kind invitations of some
                                    relations in the country, which used to accompany the turkies,
                                    chines, and hampers of game, they occasionally sent me. But the
                                    necessary leisure never arrived; nor do I know when I should
                                    have found the expected opportunity, if the last will and
                                    testament of my deceased uncle had not presented it to me.
                              </span></p>
                        <p><span class="letter">Having, in a few months, disentangled myself from
                                    all my commercial engagements, I wrote to my relation, <span
                                          class="persName">Sir Wm. Overhill</span>, to inform him of
                                    my intention to pay him the long-promised visit, and waited with
                                    a school-boy's impatience for the day when I was to turn my back
                                    upon <span class="placeName">London</span>, in search, as it
                                    were, of a new life, and, as yet, untasted pleasures, in a
                                    distant part of the kingdom. </span></p>
                        <p><span class="letter">My journey was one continued scene of delightful
                                    variety. The manufacturing towns through which I passed, being
                                    in some degree connected with my former profession, had a
                                    natural claim to my attention. The navigable river, the verdant
                                    pasture, and expanding harvest, were not unfamiliar to my
                                    commercial reflections: but the mountain, the hanging wood, the
                                    jutting rock, and the roaring water-fall, awakened sensations of
                                    pleasure as yet unknown to me, and of which I was delighted to
                                    find myself susceptible. The bold abruptness of nature I had
                                    never before seen but in the representation of the painter.
                              </span></p>
                        <p><span class="letter">Glowing with these impressions, panting after new
                                    objects of delight, and eager to see a part of my family I had
                                    not seen for many years, I arrived at the entrance of the
                                    stately old avenue which led to the mansion of my country
                                    cousin. </span></p>
                        <p><span class="letter">As I was hourly expected, the servants were on the
                                    watch to give notice of my approach, and when my chaise reached
                                    the door, I found the old Gothic porch filled with the family,
                                    who were ready to receive me with all those respectful
                                    attentions which so near and so wealthy a relation might be
                                    supposed to deserve. </span></p>
                        <p><span class="letter">On my descending from the chaise, Sir William
                                    received me with a look of real satisfaction; and having almost
                                    dislocated my wrist, by the hearty shake of the hand with which
                                    he welcomed me, he presented me to his lady, who concluded many
                                    expressions of regard, by saying, "that long-look'd-for was come
                                    at last." She then ordered her three daughters to come forward
                                    and salute their London cousin. The young ladies, indeed, did
                                    not seem so bashful as I expected from a country education, but
                                    concluding that their unembarrassed reception of my embrace
                                    arose from their joy to see me, I checked the rising surprise.
                              </span></p>
                        <p><span class="letter">It was about seven in the evening; and, on my
                                    mentioning tea as the refreshment most agreable [sic] to me, Sir
                                    William's countenance seemed not to possess all the approbation
                                    which would probably have accompanied my proposal for a bowl of
                                    punch or a bottle of wine. The tea-table, however, soon made its
                                    appearance, and my three fair cousins were hardly constrained by
                                    my presence from engaging in a very unpleasant contest about the
                                    honour of preparing the regale which I had requested. It was,
                                    however, determined by the mother, that Peggy, who was her
                                    favourite, should perform the ceremony; while her two sisters
                                    sat in malignant sulkiness, watching her motions, and ridiculing
                                    her civilities to me, and whispering their wishes, that the
                                    tea-pot might fall from her hand, or the boiling water be poured
                                    upon it. </span></p>
                        <p><span class="letter">I took my beverage without appearing to observe the
                                    little hostilities which were passing around me: and continued
                                    answering the reiterated questions of the baronet and his lady,
                                    till 1 became quite exhausted, and was on the point of desiring
                                    to be conducted to my chamber, when supper was announced; and I
                                    was ushered into a large adjoining room, where a banquet was
                                    prepared that would have satisfied the hungry expectation of
                                    gluttony itself. </span></p>
                        <p><span class="letter">Instead of that rest which I so much wanted, I was
                                    forced to a meal of which I had no appetite to partake; and
                                    though I resisted, with all the politeness I was capable of
                                    exerting, the various recommendations of the good things placed
                                    before me, I was so far obliged to comply with the hospitable
                                    solicitations, that I retired at a late hour to my chamber, with
                                    a loaded stomach, and found my servant so completely inebriated
                                    as to be totally disqualified from any one act of his usual
                                    duty. In this situation I passed a restless night; and at an
                                    early hour of the morning, when nature, after the struggles of
                                    indigestion, was yielding to repose, I was disturbed by <span
                                          class="persName">Sir William</span>'s entrance into my
                                    chamber, in order to conduct me to the stable and the
                                    dog-kennel. </span></p>
                        <p><span class="letter">This invitation, which was intended as a civility, I
                                    knew not how to resist, and I obeyed with the best grace in my
                                    power: when, after having been deafened with the noise of dogs,
                                    and poisoned with the smell of horse-flesh, 1 was hurried to the
                                    stable to take a view of the stud, and to be particularly
                                    instructed in all the merits of a famous race-horse; who, from
                                    my want of caution in approaching too near him, was within a few
                                    inches of kicking me out of existence. </span></p>
                        <p><span class="letter">We now retreated to coffee, tea, and chocolate, with
                                    hot loaves soaked in butter, and the teasing civilities of my
                                    rival cousins. The moment the breakfast was over I was hurried
                                    round a large park, and rowed about a large lake of water,
                                    beneath the scorching influence of a meridian sun: in short,
                                    every day brought a hurry of entertainments along with it; and
                                    what with visiting and receiving visits, attending horse-races
                                    and assemblies, with jaunts to shew me the country, during the
                                    six weeks I had promised to stay with this family, I scarce had
                                    a moment I could call my own; and often did I long to be
                                    restored to the quiet of my little garden at <span
                                          class="placeName">Clapham</span>, where, after the
                                    fatigues of business, I was wont to find that tranquillity which
                                    I have now sought in vain at a hundred and fifty miles distance
                                    from the capital. </span></p>
                        <p><span class="letter">But my country history ends not here: for I found
                                    that this family, where I had expected to find the plain
                                    unassuming virtues of a provincial life, was an epitome of the
                                    fashionable busy world; and that not only the London fashions,
                                    but some of its dissipations, to say no worse, were to be seen
                                    at <span class="placeName">Overhill Hall</span>. The baronet
                                    himself let me into the secret of a little dairy-maid, who was
                                    very pretty and very kind; while the good lady, his wife, was
                                    never so happy as when <span class="persName">Mr. Sturdy</span>,
                                    the curate, came to read a new novel to her on a rainy morning.
                                    My young cousins have each of them a secret lover; and the
                                    youngest, with all her family pride, would certainly have
                                    decamped with a young apothecary in the neighbourhood, if I had
                                    not been accidentally in the way to prevent such a miserable
                                    expedition. </span></p>
                        <p><span class="letter">Envy, scandal, and calumny seem to be as well
                                    understood there, and as liberally practised, as in the
                                    metropolis. In short, I rejoiced that the term of my visit was
                                    concluded; and when I took leave of my hospitable relations, for
                                    hospitable they were, 1 seemed to find tranquillity on a
                                    turnpike road and in a public inn. </span></p>
