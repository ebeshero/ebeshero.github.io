                <p>William Combe, (born 1741, Bristol, Gloucestershire, England—died June 19, 1823,
                    London), prolific English writer of miscellaneous prose and satirical verse who
                    is best remembered for the popular Dr. Syntax series of books, published between
                    1812 and 1821, for which he supplied text and Thomas Rowlandson provided
                    drawings.</p>
                <p>Combe was educated at Eton College. He was left a legacy by a wealthy London
                    merchant, William Alexander, and used it to travel widely and to live in a
                    princely manner. He fell heavily into debt and, after a varied career as private
                    soldier, waiter, teacher, and cook, returned to London about 1771 and thereafter
                    earned his living as a writer.</p>
