            <p>The poetry and illustrations that make up the first book in the Dr. Syntax series,
                The Tour of Dr. Syntax: In Search of the Picturesque (1812), appeared originally in
                publisher Rudolph Ackermann’s Poetical Magazine in 1809–11. Ackermann published the
                first book and oversaw Combe and Rowlandson’s collaboration; as Combe later
                explained, Rowlandson made the drawings, and Combe then wrote poetry to accompany
                them. Combe and Rowlandson again worked together on that book’s successors, The
                Second Tour of Dr. Syntax: In Search of Consolation (1820) and The Third Tour of Dr.
                Syntax: In Search of a Wife (1821), both also published by Ackermann. All the Dr.
                Syntax books satirize the many 18th- and early 19th-century writers whose “Tours,”
                “Travels,” and “Journeys” were vehicles for sententious moralizing, uninspired
                raptures, and sentimental accounts of amorous adventures. Combe and Rowlandson also
                collaborated on The English Dance of Death (1815), which contains some of Combe’s
                best verse, and The Dance of Life (1816–17).</p>
