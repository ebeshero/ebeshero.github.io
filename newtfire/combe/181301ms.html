         <p><span>If my memory does not fail me, I have read somewhere, though I do not recollect in
               what author, the following curious description of a love-scene, or an animated
               courtship between two persons in an inferior class of life. It was acted in the face
               of any passenger in the street who thought proper to stand still and observe it. A
               maid was rubbing the windows of a gentleman's house within, and her humble admirer,
               the footman, was so fortunate as to be employed in cleaning the same panes of glass
               in the more exposed situation on the side towards the street. After a short parley,
               which was not audible, the house-maid began, with an aspect that marked nothing more
               than attention to the work in hand; and, breathing on the glass, followed the vapour
               with a dry cloth, that she employed with utmost activity in every direction and
               figure in which her hands could move, or the space would allow. The footman, after
               looking at her for a moment, fetched a sigh, that seemed to come from the bottom of
               his heart; and, with rather a disconsolate air, began his operations, after the fair
               one’s example, on his side of the window. He continued to work on in silence, and
               with evident looks of disappointment, till at length the fair one smiled, and, with
               all the symptoms of genuine coquetry, threw from between her red pouting lips, a mist
               on every spot, as it became sufficiently transparent for him to view her. With this
               artifice, and the aid of her napkin, she contrived to conceal herself from her
               admirer; while he, with the most ardent impetuosity, endeavoured to countermine her
               operations, and to work through every thing that interrupted his view of her. This
               animated contest held for several large panes of glass, until the amorous waggery was
               changed into the more familiar act of breathing in each other's faces, and catching
               the impression. Thus these fond and lively fellow-servants indulged their
               imaginations with their nearness and distance from each other, until the window
               became at length so transparent, that the charms of the Abigail so enlivened the
               knight of the shoulder-knot, that he jumped in at the window, and game at romps
               ensued, which hurried the parties, with much playfulness, through a door into another
               room, where their supportive contest was no longer visible. </span></p>
         <p><span>The recollection of this little amusing story has suggested to me certain ideas,
               on the vast variety of what are called courtships, previous to, or with a view to
               produce the hymeneal connection; from the highest ranks of life, to those classes who
               earn their bread by the sweat of their brow, or even such as profess to subsist by
               the alms which they solicit. Indeed, I myself remember, that in the course of a tour
               through one of our distant counties I witnessed a most joyous scene, produced by a
               large gang of gypsies, who were celebrating a marriage which had taken place among
               that fraternity. </span></p>
         <p><span><span class="persName">Hogarth</span> has, with his inimitable pencil, in his
               series of prints, with the title of <span class="emph">Marriage a la Mode</span>,
               displayed the courtship between nobility and wealth, ancient blood and vulgar origin,
               and an alliance between an house in <span class="placeName">Grosvenorsquare</span>
               and a shop on <span class="placeName">London bridge</span>. This idea of the
               varieties and motives of love-making, might furnish a numerous succession of serious,
               comical, and moral pictures; and if <span class="persName">Mr. Ackermann</span> could
               persuade his friends, <span class="persName">Mr. Rowlandson</span> and <span
                  class="persName">Dr. Syntax</span>, to unite their labours in such an undertaking,
               a most amusing, interesting, and, I shall add, instructive volume might be added to
               his respectable publications. But this by the way, for I merely intend what I have
               written to serve ad an introduction to a letter which I have received from a
               complaining and disappointed correspondent, who, with a very independent property,
               has not been able to persuade any young gentlewoman, for that is his expression, to
               go to church with him. This misfortune, for such he seriously considers it to be, he
               attributes, with great simplicity, to his deficiency in the arts of courtship; and he
               applies to me, to favor him with my opinion, and to give him such instruction as may
               render him more successful than he has hitherto been in his attempts to enter the
               Temple of Hymen. But I shall let him speak for himself, which he does, pretty much at
               large, in the following letter: </span></p>
         <div class="letter">
            <p><span class="letter">TO THE MODERN SPECTATOR. Would-be Grove. SIR, </span></p>
            <p><span class="letter">I am a young man--I beg your pardon for changing the expression,
                  but to do myself justice, and to appear in my proper character to you, I am a
                  young gentleman of twenty-three years of age, and possess an estate of eighteen
                  hundred pounds a year, three hundred of which I farm myself, and am supposed to
                  understand country matters as well as most gentlemen; --indeed, which is some
                  proof of it, I became last year a member of your famous Agricultural Society in
                  London. I am, besides, lord of the manor, and have a very good house, with a fine
                  sheepwalk round it, and a large canal at the bottom of my garden, full of carp and
                  tench. I sit in a fine family pew when I go to church, and have lately taken down
                  the old green and yellow lining, and fitted it up with a bright red cloth, with a
                  fringe, and covered the cushions with the same, so that they are fit for any lady
                  in the land to sit upon and say her prayers, or sing psalms if she pleases.
                  Indeed, to say the truth, they are so nice and soft, that I can never hear the
                  parson's sermon through without falling asleep. I have also been summoned upon
                  three grand juries, and it has been hinted to me, that it may not be long before I
                  am nominated high sheriff of the county. I was educated in Latin by our vicar, who
                  is said to be a great scholar; and in writing and accounts by the exciseman in our
                  parish. I am also thought to dance very well, having been taught by the
                  merry-andrew of a mountebank, who comes every year into this neighborhood, and had
                  been a tumbler at <span class="placeName">Sadler's Wells</span>, near <span
                     class="placeName">London</span>. My father wished to send me to a free-school,
                  but my grandmother, who had money to leave, said it would only corrupt my morals;
                  and accordingly I was educated at home. Besides, I am an officer in the yeoman
                  cavalry, and I have overheard it said, when we have been out at exercise, that I
                  have more the looks of a real soldier than any one in the troop. Nor is this all,
                     <span class="persName">Mr. Spectator</span>; for , though I do not pretend to
                  make any great boast of it, I am of a very ancient family; as <span
                     class="persName">Mr. Serjeant Bother'em</span>, a great lawyer who comes our
                  circuit, told me once at the assizes, which I went to ask his opinion relative to
                  my right to a water-course, that he believed the family of the <span class="emph"
                     >Would-be’s</span> was co-eval with the creation of man. </span></p>
            <p><span class="letter">Under these circumstances I turned my thoughts toward marriage,
                  and looked about me, to fix on some young gentlewoman whom I might lead, as the
                  newspapers call it, to the alter of Hymen. I am not anxious after fortune; for,
                  tho' I know how to take care of my money, I hate and abominate an avaricious
                  principle; and so that she was of an agreeable person, and understood the manners
                  of a gentlewoman, whether she had one thousand or ten thousand pounds as a
                  marriage portion, was not a serious consideration with me. </span></p>
            <p><span class="letter">Now there were several fair ones in my part of the country that
                  I thought would suit me; but I was determined to feel my way with them all, before
                  I made a formal proposal to any one of them. This I thought might be done by
                  certain compliments, and sly hints, and conversations half joking and half
                  earnest. Accordingly I set out a knight-erranting, as I think it is called; and I
                  made my first set at the house of a baronet, who had seven daughters, all of them
                  agreeable young ladies; and I was cock sure, to use a sportsman’s phrase, that,
                  out of this fine covey, I should be sure to kill my bird. Accordingly, as I was
                  walking with them on the lawn after dinner, I seized the opportunity of taking
                  from my pocket a small looking-glass, in a red Morocco case, and presenting it to
                  the youngest of the ladies, assured her, with all the gravity I could muster up,
                  that if she would open it, she would see the exact representation of the prettiest
                  woman in the world; when, having adjusted her hair by it, she coolly returned it
                  to me, and told me, if I would look at it, I should see the portrait of the
                  greatest clodpole on earth. This repartee produced a most violent shout of
                  laughter from them all; when <span class="persName">Sir William</span>, to save me
                  as well he could from my state of confusion, exclaimed, "Never mind them, my good
                  friend, seven to one is too much for any man, so come and play a game of bowls
                  with the gentlemen:" upon which being nettled on the occasion, I replied at once,
                  and without the least hesitation, "That I will with all my heart, <span
                     class="persName">Sir William</span>; for I perceive, if one attempts to play at
                  bowls with the ladies, one is sure to meet with rubbers." This occasioned another
                  shout from the misses, who, as with one voice, cried out, "O what wit ! what a
                  delightful repartee ! and so <span class="emph">very original!</span>" and then
                  they all ran off laughing to a distant part of the garden. </span></p>
            <p><span class="letter">My next attempt was upon the daughter of Squire Hawker, who, in
                  his sporting rambles, frequently gives me a call; and as he always says I have the
                  best Port wine in the country, he proves the truth of his opinion, by never
                  failing to take a couple of bottles of it. In a visit to his house accidentally on
                  purpose, Miss Hawker, in a discourse with another lady about dress, happened to
                  say, that red suited her complexion best; when I immediately observed, that if she
                  would come to our church, she should sit in my pew, which was lately lined with
                  fine scarlet cloth, where I was sure she would look like an angel; "and who
                  knows," I added, "but we might both find ourselves in an humour to go to the alter
                  for you know what?"—"That," she replied, with a kind of simper, "is a proceeding
                  which requires no small consideration; and, in the mean time, it would be
                  perfectly gallant, if you would pull down half a dozen yards of that self-same
                  scarlet cloth, to make me a riding-dress." That thought I, is a good hint,
                  however; so I sent for my tailor, who is a knowing kind of fellow, having served
                  his time in <span class="placeName">London</span>, and told him to contrive,
                  somehow or other, to get the lady’s size, and make her a smart riding-dress,
                  according to the latest fashion, and of her favorite colour. This was no sooner
                  said than done, and a dollar bribed one of the family to introduce it into her
                  private room, without pretending to know from whence it came. In a few days after,
                  the lady’s father called upon me, to take a couple of bottles of the best wine in
                  the county; and at the same time he thanked me, on behalf of his daughter, for my
                  handsome present; as they all knew immediately, from the very genteel manner in
                  which it was done, that it came from me. I now thought things were in a fair
                  train, and too an early opportunity to see Miss Hawker; nor did I fail to ask her
                  when I should be permitted to see her in the riding-dress. After thanking me for
                  my gallantry, she said, that as the family were going into mourning for an aunt
                  who was just dead, she had sent it to be dyed black. I immediately replied, that I
                  could not but wish it had been <span class="emph">true blue</span>. "Heavens
                  forbid!" she cried, "for then I might be supposed to belong to one or other of
                  those stupid and stupefying creatures, the yeoman cavalry." At this I was
                  perfectly astounded, as you must know, <span class="persName">Mr.
                  Spectator</span>, that blue is the colour to which I belong. I accordingly took my
                  leave in a huff, and am determined that <span class="persName">Mr. Hawker</span>
                  shall never drink any more of the best wine in the county in my house. I need not
                  add, I think, that I am for ever cured of the gallantry of contriving to send
                  riding-dresses to young ladies. </span></p>
            <p><span class="letter">I shall trouble you only with one more of my disappointments in
                  going a courting, though I could tell half a dozen more, at least. It is as
                  follows:-- </span></p>
            <p><span class="letter">Happening to be at a poney-race, a widow lady, who lives very
                  genteely with an only daughter, on the side of the common where this sport took
                  place, invited me to take a dish of tea with her; and she sent the message by a
                  servant in a very handsome livery. It accordingly occurred to me, to turn this
                  circumstance to the account of what is ever uppermost in my mind. In the course of
                  the conversation, the good lady observed, that she should never consent to her
                  daughter’s going to the alter of Hymen, unless her lover conducted her in his own
                  carriage. On this hint, as it appeared to me, I said that I had a very smart
                  postchaise, and had lately bought a very handsome pair of black, long-tailed
                  horses at <span class="placeName">Northampton</span> fair; and if <span
                     class="persName">Miss Peacock</span>, for that was the lady's name, was
                  disposed to take a jaunt to this self-same alter of Hymen, I was ready to attend
                  her in my carriage; and that my fine black horses, with their long tails, should
                  draw her thither. Now I expected thanks, at least, for my civil offer, when <span
                     class="persName">Mrs. Peacock</span> drew up her head, and desired I would keep
                  my vulgar, filthy ideas to myself; and miss, but in a less angry tone of voice,
                  advised me to put my black horses with their long tails into one of my own carts,
                  and drive it myself to <span class="placeName">Northampton</span> fair, to fetch
                  back a sufficient quantity of calves to keep up the breed at <span class="emph"
                     >Would-be-Grove</span>. I need not add how this visit ended. </span></p>
            <p><span class="letter">I hope you will pardon me, <span class="persName">Mr.
                     Spectator</span>, but there is one little story more, which I had forgot, and I
                  wish to relate it, because it is a good one, and has some fun in it. </span></p>
            <p><span class="letter">I was one day out with <span class="persName">Squire
                     Harkaway</span>'s hounds, when we killed a fox close to his park-pales; and he
                  accordingly asked all the company up to the hall to take some refreshment.
                  Observing, as we were enjoying ourselves, a large pair of stag's antlers over the
                  chimney-piece, on which the gentlemen hung their hats, I said to one of the <span
                     class="persName">Miss Harkaways</span>, that I would make interest with her to
                  procure me a pair next buck season, to put up in my hall. This she very obligingly
                  promised to do next summer, "But let me advise you," she added, "to take care that
                  the horns did not, somehow or other, get from the wall to my head."--"I think," I
                  replied, "while there is such a horsewhip as this in my hand to be found in my
                  house, she will be a bold woman that does it; for I would certainly flog her
                  through every room of the house, till I flogged her out of it." The squire
                  instantly clapped me on the back, and said, that he had not heard so good a thing
                  for many a day. </span></p>
            <p><span class="letter">Now, <span class="persName">Mr. Spectator</span>, you have the
                  full and true account of my situation; and I look to you for the best advice you
                  can give me on the occasion. At the same time, you must know, that if I do not
                  hear satisfactorily from you in the course of a fortnight, I shall settle myself
                  in another way, as you shall hear. </span></p>
            <p><span class="letter">My dairy-woman has a niece, who is the picture of beauty and
                  innocence. But do not be alarmed, I shall never act as <span class="persName">Jack
                     Scapegrace</span>, of our corps, is continually persuading me to do: I will
                  never set a bad example to my neighbourhood. Then there is the vicar’s daughter,
                  though no so handsome, she is a nice notable young woman, and performs on the
                  piano-forte. She sing the song of <span class="emph">Sweet Willy O</span>, which
                  is my name, most delightfully, and plays the Volunteer’s March with great spirit.

                  of being laughed at and ridiculed, one of these females I will certainly marry,
                  and shortly too. You cannot, therefore, do me a greater favour than by sending an
                  immediate answer to </span></p>
