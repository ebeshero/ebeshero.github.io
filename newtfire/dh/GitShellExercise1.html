        <p>You now know the basics of collaborating on a
        Git / GitHub project. We recommend you clone our <a
            href="https://github.com/ebeshero/DHClass-Hub" target="_blank">DHClass-Hub</a>. Once
        you have cloned it explore the repo through your local machine's file explorer. Then add
        a file to our sandbox folder. In order for you to push that file we will need to add you
        as a collaborator. This is the perfect moment to create a GitHub issue. Navigate to the
        <a href="https://github.com/ebeshero/DHClass-Hub" target="_blank">DHClass-Hub GitHub
            page</a>. At the top of the page, under <q>ebeshero/DHClass-Hub</q> you will see a
        tab that says <q>Issues</q>. When you create your own repo you may need to change the
        settings to include an issues board; follow directions <a target="_blank"
            href="https://help.github.com/articles/managing-projects-with-issues/">here</a>.
        Once you are in our <a href="https://github.com/ebeshero/DHClass-Hub/issues"
            target="_blank">DHClass-Hub Issues Board</a> notice there are open issues and closed
        issues. Search through the open issues for an issue where others are asking to be added
        as a collaborator. If there is such an issue already existing click on it. If there is
        not an existing issue click the <q>New issue</q> button at the top of the page.</p>
