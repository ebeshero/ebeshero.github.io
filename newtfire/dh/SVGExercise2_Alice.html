        <h3>The text</h3>
        <p>With this assignment, you will gain experience with writing XSLT to generate SVG. 
            We will work with an XML document from <a href="http://alice.obdurodon.org/">a Pitt student project</a> on Lewis Carroll’s <cite>Alice in Wonderland</cite>, and you can download
            the file from here by right-clicking <a href="alice_quotes.xml">on this</a>. (Don’t
            just click to open it in a browser and copy, which can add some browser rendering
            characters that will mess up your code; right click and download.)</p>
        <img src="aliceFlamingo.svg" width="200"/>
        <p>Let’s analyze the Alice XML file. The root element, <code>&lt;alice&gt;</code>, contains
                <code>&lt;cast&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;titlePage&gt;</code> child elements, both of
            which you can ignore, followed by twelve child <code>&lt;chapter&gt;</code> elements.
            The chapters are numbered with a <code>@which</code> attribute, e.g., <code>&lt;chapter
                which="1"&gt;</code>. Chapters contain paragraph elements (<code>&lt;p&gt;</code>),
            which contain various child elements and descendants. You are interested in the
                <code>&lt;q&gt;</code> elements inside the chapters (at various depths), which are
            used to tag quotes by characters in the story.</p>
        <h3>The task</h3>
        <p>Your goal is to create a line graph that charts the number of quotes by Alice herself in each chapter. You do not have to graph any
            character except Alice. Your X axis marks the chapters and your Y values reflect the
            number of <code>&lt;q&gt;</code> elements in each chapter that have an <code>@sp</code>
            attribute equal to <q>alice</q>. A complete line graph might look something like <a
                href="alice_svg_output.svg">http://newtfire.org/dh/alice_svg_output.svg</a>. We are going to plot a line graph 
            (instead of something like a bar graph) because we want to indicate variation across a connected series (over time) from chapter to chapter. <span class="smaller">(When you think about SVG for your projects, 
        think about what kinds of plots make sense: For some kinds of data that aren't connected to each other, we might want side-by-side bars to compare.)</span></p>
       
        <h3>The XSLT Stylesheet Template for Outputting SVG</h3>
        <p>To output SVG from XML, we need to make some modifications to the default xs:stylesheet and xsl:output statements, so that
        the XSLT properly outputs valid W3c code that we can read in a web browser. Below is the code you need at the
        top of your XSLT file for this assignment. The input XML is not in the TEI namesepace, so we use the defalut XML schema,
        but we need to indicate the output SVG namespace (in the highlighted <span style="color: purple;">purple</span> line below.
        The xsl:output method is set to "xml" as a default, classifying SVG as a kind of XML.
        </p>
        
        
        <pre>
           &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;xsl:stylesheet xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform" version="2.0"
    xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"
    exclude-result-prefixes="xs"
    <span style="color: purple;">xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg</span>"&gt;
   
    &lt;xsl:output method="xml" indent="yes"/&gt; 
            
        </pre>
        
        <h3>Working with variables</h3>
        <p>Our solution uses <em>global variables</em> (variables that are defined once for the
            entire stylesheet) as well as variables that have different values for each chapter in
            the book (that is, for each dot in the graph). We worked with variables already in the XSLT Exercises
            5 and 6, but for a review, see <a
                href="http://www.w3schools.com/xsl/el_variable.asp"
                >http://www.w3schools.com/xsl/el_variable.asp</a> or look them up in the Michael Kay book. What is new here is that 
            we are going to use multiple variables, and most of these will help us to generate the number values we need to plot our SVG graph.</p>
        <p>As an example of a global variable, the amount of space between chapters on the X axis
            (that is, the amount of horizontal space between dots) is constant for the entire SVG
            graph. That is, each dot is the same distance from its neighbors as other dots are from
            their neighbors. If we want that distance to be, say, 100 pixels, we can define a global
            variable with something like:</p>
        <pre>&lt;xsl:variable name="Xinterval" select="100"/&gt;</pre>
        <p>We can then refer to the <code>$Xinterval</code> variable when we need to space out our
            dots while plotting them. This is a <dfn>convenience variable</dfn>, which means that it
            wasn’t absolutely necessary, since we could instead have written <q>100</q> wherever we
            need it. What’s convenient about the variable is that if we later decide to change the
            value, it could be hard to find a number inside XSLT or SVG code. If we’ve put the
            number in a variable definition, we can find and change it more easily. Global variables
            are defined as children of the root <code>&lt;xsl:stylesheet&gt;</code> element. We
            usually write them immediately after our <code>&lt;xsl:output&gt;</code> element, so
            that we can find them easily.</p>
        <p>We can also set convenience variable values that may be different for different chapters
            (different dots); these are not global variables because they don’t always have the same
            value. For example, in the code that draws the dots for each chapter, we can set the X
            position of a dot with something like:</p>
        <pre>&lt;xsl:variable name="Xpos" select="position() * $Xinterval"/></pre>
        <p>If we’ve previously defined <code>$Xinterval</code> as equal to <q>100</q>, this will set
            the value of the <code>$Xpos</code> variable to <q>100</q> for chapter 1 (the first of
            the twelve chapters, and therefore in position #1), to <q>200</q> for chapter 2, etc. We
            can then plot the dot with something like (you will also already have calculated the Y
            position and assigned that value to the variable <code>$Ypos</code>):</p>
        <pre>&lt;circle cx="{$Xpos}" cy="{$Ypos} r="5" fill="red"&gt;</pre>
        <p>Note the curly braces, which create an attribute value template (AVT) that causes the
            variable to be interpreted and its value to be output. If you don’t use an AVT, you’ll
            set your X position to a literal value of <q>$Xpos</q>, which is invalid because the X
            position of an SVG <code>&lt;circle&gt;</code> element must be numeric. You don’t need
            curly braces for the <code>@r</code> attribute (the radius of the circle) because that
            value already is a number, and you don’t need it for the <code>@fill</code> (color)
            because that value should be a literal color name or some other representation of a
            color.</p>
        <p>Putting the X position into a variable is handy because you're going to need it both to
            position the dot and to position the chapter label (see the labels on the X axis on our
            sample output at the link above). If you calculate the position for each chapter once
            and stash it in a variable, you reuse the variable to position two things without having
            to redo the calculation.</p>
        <h3>Writing the XSLT</h3>
        <p>Writing SVG with XSLT almost always involves using the “pull” approach, which selects for just the bits of data you need. 
            After you create the SVG superstructure, plot the X and Y axes, and label the Y axis at intervals, you
            can draw the dots, the lines between dots, and the labels on the X axis either by
            applying templates to all <code>&lt;chapter&gt;</code> elements or by using
                <code>&lt;xsl:for-each select="//chapter"&gt;</code>. If you use the
                <code>&lt;xsl:for-each&gt;</code> strategy, you’ll need only one template for the
            document node, and you’ll put the <code>&lt;xsl:for-each&gt;</code> inside that. If you
            apply templates to chapters, you’ll need two templates: a template for the document
            node, in which you’ll create the SVG superstructure, and a template that matches
                <code>&lt;chapter&gt;</code> elements.</p>
        <p>You can can draw the dot for each chapter when you process that chapter, but to draw
            connecting lines between the dots, you’ll need to access information about two chapters
            at once. One will be the one you’re processing; the other will be either the one before
            or the one after. There are several ways to do that, and we’ll talk about them when we
            go over the solution, but whatever you do, note that with twelve chapters you have
            twelve dots but only eleven connecting lines. This means that one chapter (either the
            first or the last, depending on how you structure your code) will have to be treated
            differently from the others. For that reason, you may find it useful to test whether
            you’re at the beginning or end of the sequence of chapters with
                <code>&lt;xsl:if&gt;</code>.</p>
        <h3>What to Submit</h3>
        <p>Turn in your XSLT file. We will generate your SVG output ourselves by running your XSLT. 
            Remember to save and open your SVG output in oXygen and in a web browser to be sure it is valid and that it is rendering as you think it should be. </p>
