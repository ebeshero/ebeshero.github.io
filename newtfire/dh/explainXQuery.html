      <h3>What's an XML database and how does it work? </h3>
      			
      
      <p>XQuery is one of the XML family of languages, and it builds on what you've learned
         of XPath. We use XQuery to work with databases of stored and indexed XML files. XML
         databases  basically work by storing XML files and building "persistent indexes" for
         them--and this indexing capacity makes it quick and efficient to search for elements,
         attribute values (and the other things we've been doing with XPath expressions) across
         collections of files, by effectively reviewing the index that the database builds
         for each file, so that the computer doesn't have to review the entire file. Basically
         the index stores the tree-structure of XML in the database memory, and makes it available
         for quick retrieval through XQuery. 
         
      </p>
      			
      
      <h3>How to Access our eXist XML database: </h3>
      			
      
      <p>For our class and the Pacific project, we're working with a particular XML database
         called eXist, and it's installed on our private sandbox server only accessible to
         members of our class group through a secure login. To work on homework exercises and
         on project development, <strong>here's how to access eXist:</strong></p>
      		  
      
      <p>eXist is available right now in two "places", in the same way you access our Digital
         Sandbox for developing your project websites:
         
      </p>
      		  
      
      <ol>
         
         <li>In our campus computer labs, without an sremote login: <a href="http://x1.digital.greensburg.pitt.edu:8080/exist/apps/dashboard/index.html       ">http://x1.digital.greensburg.pitt.edu:8080/exist/apps/dashboard/index.html</a><br /></li>
         
         
         <li>On your OWN computers with a wireless or wired connections. (Please test this ASAP
            following the instructions below to make sure it works for you.)
            
         </li>       
         
         
      </ol>
      	      
      
      <p>To begin, you need to use the secure login, "Network Connect"--our private passageway
         to eXist. If you're enrolled in this class, you've been granted access. Here's what
         to do: 
         
      </p>
      
      
      <ol>
         
         
         <li>Open <b>Internet Explorer</b> or <b>Firefox</b>, and go to <a href="http://sremote.pitt.edu">http://sremote.pitt.edu</a> . (Network Connect won't be fully functional in other browsers.) If you can't get
            in through Explorer, try the Firefox browser.
            
         </li>
         
         
         <li>With "Network Connect" selected, log in with your Pitt userid and password (the same
            that you use for e-mail and for your Pitt web space)
            
         </li>
         
         
         <li>After you log in, you'll see a link to <b>"Firewall-GBG-DH-DIGITAL-SANDBOX-NetworkConnect."</b> Click on this to bring up a new screen with the words "Network Connect" again--this
            time with a "Start" button. <b>Click on the Start Button, and wait</b> until Network Connect seems to have run.
            
         </li>
         
         
         <li>Once you've done this, you may open ANY web browser (or a new tab in this browser)
            and go to this link to our eXist XML database:<br /><b><a href="http://x1.digital.greensburg.pitt.edu:8080/exist/apps/dashboard/index.html ">http://x1.digital.greensburg.pitt.edu:8080/exist/apps/dashboard/index.html</a></b>
            
            
         </li>
         
         
         <li>Here, you may log in locally with:
            
            
            <ul>
               
               
               <li>id: your Pitt userid </li>
               
               
               <li>password: dhclass </li>
               
               
            </ul>
            <br />
            (After you log in for the first time, change the password to whatever you want.) 
            
            
         </li>
         
         
         <li>Open <b>eXide</b> to work on XQuery. 
            
         </li>
         
         
         
      </ol>
      
      
      
      <p>Â </p>
      
      
      <h3>How the database is organized: </h3>
      			
      
      <p>eXist is set up like a file directory with a hierarchical order--a little like a massive
         XML file with subfiles! So there's a single root directory called <strong>"db"</strong>, with subfolders containing folders (or collections), which may in turn contain their
         own subfolders (more collections), and finally files.  I've installed a copy of our
         Georg Forster XML file here, in a collection called "voyages," inside a directory
         called "pacific", which is so its address is <span class="code">/db/pacific/voyages/ForsterGeorgComplete.xml</span> . 
         
      </p>
      			
      
      <p>As we work on project development, you may find that you want to upload your own collection
         of XML files into eXist, and we'll walk you through how to do that. This is different
         from uploading files to publish on your web space, which makes them publicly viewable
         but doesn't build index files or let you collect, extract, and remix your coding using
         XQuery. 
         
      </p>
      		  
      
      <h3>XQuery for a Single Document vs. a Collection:</h3>
      			
      
      <p>XQuery uses XPath expressions to find its way through its index of files. It can work
         on one file, or on a whole collection, thus:
         
      </p>
      			
      
      <ul>
         
         
         <li>The <span class="code">doc()</span> function in XQuery finds a single document, and inside the parentheses goes the path
            to the document within the database, including the filename. To retrieve our Georg
            Forster XML file, use: <span class="code">doc('/db/pacific/voyages/ForsterGeorgComplete.xml')</span> . <br /><br /> 
            
         </li>
         
         
         <li>The <span class="code">collection()</span> function finds a directory (or collection) that holds XML files. We've uploaded two
            other voyage files to sit in the same collection with our Georg Forster file, and
            we can run a  query of the ENTIRE group of files, instead of looking through each,
            one by one. To query this collection of files, we use <span class="code">collection('/db/pacific/voyages')</span>.<br /><br /> 
            
         </li>
         
         
         <li>To return a complete single document so you can browse through its coding and structure,
            write an expression in this form: 
            <span class="code">doc('/db/pacific/voyages/ForsterGeorgComplete.xml')/* </span>  <br />
            <br />
            
            
         </li>
         
         
         <li>Try accessing other files in this same collection space: HwksV2Ch4-8PNum.xml and cookVoy2Pnum.xml<br />
            <br />
            
            
         </li>
         
         
         <li>To write comments (or "comment out" some lines in XQuery), use <span class="code">(: comment :) </span></li>
         
         
      </ul>
      
      
      
      <p>Actually, both <span class="code">doc()</span> and <span class="code">collection()</span> are XPath functions, and we'll be adding more XPath, once you've designated the document
         or collection: You can write path expressions, use predicates, functions, walk up
         and down axes. This works if the files in your collection are coded (at least structurally)
         in the same or similar ways.
         
      </p>
      
      
      <h3>The TEI and XQuery: Declaring the TEI Namespace</h3>
      
      
      <p>Speaking of coding in the same or similar ways, we need to introduce you to the Text
         Encoding Initiative, or TEI. This a language of XML with designated rules and tag
         sets for coding digital versions of literary, linguistic, historical, and cultural
         texts, and it represents an international standard for coding work consistently for
         long-term, sustainable archives. TEI is also a community (of which I'm a member),
         and people serve on its ruling Council to make judgment calls on best practices and
         coding guidelines. We use TEI to build digital archives that can "talk to" each other
         around the world, and follow recognizable, standard patterns. We *could* make up our
         own XML tag sets, but when coding cultural resources, it's a Good Idea to make your
         work accessible, so its easy for others to access and, say, load into databases to
         run XQuery for analyzing it, or studying it, or connecting it wiht other comparable
         texts in other archives! We'll talk more about TEI structure and coding, and give
         you some experience with it. (To read more, <a href="http://www.tei-c.org/index.xml">here's the TEI's home site</a>.) For now, you can quickly tell if one of our files is coded in TEI from its root
         element: <span class="code">&lt;TEI&gt;</span> .
         
      </p>
      
      
      <p>XQuery needs something called a <b>namespace declaration</b> when we use the TEI, in order to properly follow its index and in order to follow
         the schema rules for TEI (to determine if your file is <b>valid</b> as a TEI document). Similarly, we use a namespace declaration for html, to say there
         are certain rules governing the relationship of tags, their organization, etc.  When
         we query our TEI files, we'll need to include the following namespace declaration
         as the first statement of our XQuery: <span class="code">declare default element namespace "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0";<br />
            </span></p>
      
      
      <p>Here are examples of some XQuery expressions on collections of TEI files:</p>
      
      
      <p><span class="code">declare default element namespace "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0";<br />
            collection('/db/pacific/literary')//titleStmt/title</span></p>
      
      
      <p><span class="code">declare default element namespace "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0";<br />
            collection('/db/pacific/literary')/distinct-values(.//body//persName)</span></p>
      
      
      <h3><a id="FLWOR"></a>"FLWOR" Expressions in XQuery
         
      </h3>
      
      
      <p>"Flower" or FLWOR expressions are a powerful tool in XQuery, letting us work in more
         complex ways with querying and remixing information in files and collections--sometimes
         both in the same expression! Here's a primer on FLWOR (or really, LFWOR!):
         
      </p>
      
      
      
      <p>
         <span class="code">"Let":</span> establishes variables which may be single values or arrays of multiple values (single
         or multiple)<br />
         <br />
         <span class="code">"For":</span> establishes a <i>range variable</i> that moves step by step from one value to the next and the next in a long list of
         values defined by a a Let statement. (single ONLY)<br />
         <br />
         <span class="code">"Where"</span> (optional): filtering; analogous to predicates<br />
         <span class="code">"Order by"</span> (optional): alphabatize, etc. Always appears after "Where"<br />
         <br />
         <span class="code">"Return"</span>: generates output          
         
      </p>
      
      
      
      <p> <b>A really, really simple little FLWOR:</b></p>
      
      
      <p><span class="code"> let $hamlet := doc('/db/shakespeare/plays/hamlet.xml')<br />
            return $hamlet   </span></p>
      
      
      <p><b>Examples of two related FLWOR Expressions, to demonstrate the use of "For" and "Where"</b></p>
      
      
      
      <p>1.  (no "For" statement here):<br />
         <span class="code">
            declare default element namespace "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0";
            <br />
            </span><span class="code">let $cook := doc('/db/pacific/voyages/cookVoy2Pnum.xml')<br />
            </span><span class="code"> let $p := $cook//p[geo]
            <br />
            let $geo := $cook//p/geo
            <br />
            let $countlat := count ($geo[@select="lat"])
            <br />
            let $countlon := count ($geo[@select="lon"])
            <br />
            where $countlat gt $countlon
            <br />
            return $p</span></p>
      
      
      <p>2. Using a "For" statement:<br />
         <br />
         <span class="code">declare default element namespace "http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0";<br />
            let $cook := doc('/db/pacific/voyages/cookVoy2Pnum.xml') <br />
            let $P := $cook//p[geo]<br />
            let $geo := $cook//p/geo<br />
            let $countlat := count ($geo[@select="lat"])<br />
            let $countlon := count ($geo[@select="lon"])<br />
            for $p in $P  </span><br />
         <span>(:</span> to show the use of a range variable with <span class="code">for</span>, try commenting this last line out, and changing the return expression to give <span class="code">$P/@n</span> :)<br />
         <span class="code">
            where $countlat gt $countlon<br />
            return string-join(('paragraph',$p/@n),':') 
            </span> <br />
         <br />
         (: Note use of the string-join function, with its separator. Also notice which parts
         of it take the <b>single-quotes</b> <span class="code">' '</span>, and which parts don't! The single quotes,  <span class="code">' '</span> , allow you to indicate you want some literal text to be returned here. Without it,
         the computer thinks you're referring to an XPath expression. :) <br />
         
         
      </p>
      
      
      <p><b><a id="Order"></a>The "O" in the FLWOR: Order:<br />
            </b>
         The "Order" statement in the FLWOR is optional, but when you use it, it must follow
         a Where statement, and immediately precede the "Return." A default is to sort a list
         of results in alphabetical order, so, for example:
         
      </p>
      
      
      <p><span class="code"> order by $a </span></p>
      
      
      <p>organizes results in alphabetical order sorted by the whatever is indicate in the
         variable $a. <br />
         There are more complex ways to set up an order to organize results. You can order
         by descending (to get reverse alphabetical order): <span class="code">order by $a descending</span>  <br />
         Or order a set results according to their numerical position or count, in ascending
         or descending order.
         
      </p>
      
      
      <h3><a id="Curly"></a>Building New HTML or XML with XQuery: Using Curly Braces: <span class="code">{ }</span></h3>
      
      
      <p>To add HTML or XML markup to the XQuery output, add the elements where needed to produce
         conformant code. However, these elements are passive, or non-functional  when executing
         XQuery commands. So we use curly-braces<span class="code"> { } </span>to enclose any XPath or XQuery statements that we want to execute in XQuery, to separate
         them from the HTML or XML markup elements. Inside html elements, when we need to do
         some calculation or refer to a variable we defined in XQuery, we use the curly-braces
         again. We'll work on some examples in class. Here's one example that may be helpful
         as a reference point, showing how to make an html page with a table of two columns,
         making a list of two related variable results side by side. The resulting html file
         is coded to display a table of the distinct characters (&lt;SPEAKERS&gt;)in <i>Hamlet</i> from our Shakespeare collection, next to a count of their speeches (&lt;SPEECH&gt;) in
         the play. We've highlighted the position of the curly-braces in the example:
         
      </p>
      
      
      <p>&lt;html&gt;<br />
         &lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Title&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;<br />
         &lt;body&gt;<br />
         &lt;table&gt;
         <br />
         <span class="code">{</span><br />
         let $hamlet := doc('/db/shakespeare/plays/hamlet.xml')<br />
         let $speeches := $hamlet//SPEECH<br />
         let $speakers := $hamlet//SPEAKER<br />
         <br />
         let $distinctsp := distinct-values($speakers)<br />
         for $sp in $distinctsp<br />
         let $count := count($speeches[SPEAKER = $sp])<br />
         order by $count descending<br />
         return<br />
         <br />
         &lt;tr&gt;<br />
         &lt;td&gt;<span class="code">{$sp}</span>&lt;/td&gt;<br />
         &lt;td&gt;<span class="code">{$count}</span>&lt;/td&gt;<br />
         &lt;/tr&gt;<br />
         <span class="code">}</span><br />
         &lt;/table&gt;
         <br />
         &lt;/body&gt;<br />
