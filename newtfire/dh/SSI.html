        <h3>Why use server side includes?</h3>
        <span class="smaller">Adapted with thanks from Obdurodon, with local explanation added for
            newtFire.</span>
        <p><dfn>Server side includes</dfn> (SSIs) permit us to create (<dfn>boiler-plate</dfn>) text
            in one place so that we can call it and reuse it as we wish in a set of web pages. We
            often use SSIs to make a header or footer or menu bar to be positioned in the same place
            on all of the pages across a project website. Where we might copy and paste that
            information on every new page we build on a site, that becomes tedious and brittle as
            our sites grow, and as we want to make a change to the organization of our site, say, to
            add a new item on a menu bar, or to change the format of our site logo. Instead, if you
            are working in a web server environment configured to accept SSIs, you can save the
            piece that will repeat on all your pages separately in its own file and tell the web
            server, with an SSI, to insert that file into all of your pages in the location you
            designate. If you later make a change to the file you call with your include, you just
            make the change in one place, the file to be inserted, and that change will propagate to
            all the pages with an actively configured SSI in place.</p>
        <h3>Creating a file to include in your site pages</h3>
        <p>Here is an example of how to prepare a menu file in one place that you can use in all of
            your webpages on a site. To do this, you create a separate file that contains only the
            menu, which you upload to the server. This is not a complete file and on its own is not
            going to be valid HTML, but when it is included into another HTML file, it will need to
            be valid there (and not make the new page be invalid when the little include file is
            added). For example, a menu might look like:</p>
        <div class="pre-colored">
            <hr />
            <p><span style="color: blue;">Main</span> | <span style="color:blue;">About</span> |
                    <span style="color: blue;">Texts</span> | <span style="color:blue;"
                    >Analysis</span></p>
            <hr />
        </div>
        <p>and be coded as:</p>
        <pre>&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="index.html"&gt;Main&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="about.html"&gt;About&lt;/a&gt; | 
            &lt;a href="texts.html"&gt;Texts&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="analysis.html"&gt;Analysis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;</pre>
        <p>Create this as a separate document and save it with its own filename, perhaps something
            like <q>menu.html</q>.</p>
        <p>About the <q>include file</q>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The <q>include file</q> does not have to be valid or well-formed HTML. For example,
                a boilerplate header might contain an <code>&lt;hi&gt;</code> header and a
                    <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>, with no common root elements. That isn’t well-formed XML
                or HTML (which requires that everything be wrapped in a single root element), but
                it’s fine for a file to be included. The menu above contains three sibling elements,
                two horizontal rule (<code>&lt;hr&gt;</code>) elements with a <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>
                between them.</li>
            <li>The file to be inserted must not include an XML declaration (the line beginning
                    <code>&lt;?xml</code> that &lt;oXygen/&gt; creates at the beginning of regular
                XML or XHTML files) or other HTML boilerplate. <strong>What you are creating is some
                    fragmentary HTML code; it is not an HTML page.</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Create a space in the other HTML pages for the <q>include file</q></h3>
        <p>In each page where you want to insert your <q>include file</q> (in our example, a menu
            named <q>menu.html</q>), insert the following line <em>in the place in the document
                where you want the inclusion to appear</em>:</p>
        <pre>&lt;!--#include virtual="menu.html" --&gt;</pre>
        <p>This is an XML comment, but the hashtag makes it a special type of comment that will be
            understood by the web server as an instruction to insert the contents of some other file
            in place of the instruction. A few important details:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The value in quotation marks should be the path to the file you want to include. If
                it’s in the same directory as the file into which you are going to insert it, the
                path consists of just the filename. If it is in another directory, you have to tell
                the system where to find it. If you put your included files in their own
                subdirectory (called <q>inc</q>) under your main project directory, the value you
                would use is <q>inc/menu.html</q>. You can put your files wherever you want, but you
                have to tell the system how to find them.</li>
            <li>White space matters. There can be no space between the <dfn>comment start tag</dfn>
                    (<code>&lt;!--</code>) and the <dfn>include instruction</dfn>
                    (<code>#include</code>). There must be a space before the <dfn>comment end
                    tag</dfn> (<code>--&gt;</code>).</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Uploading the files to the web server</h3>
        <p>In order for server side includes to work on our newtFire server, we need to save all of
            the files involved with the <code>.html</code> extension (not as .xhtml). That has
            nothing to do with how the file is encoded under the hood, and is simply a matter of
            what file extensions our server recognizes as appropriate for use with SSIs. Once you’ve
            created the HTML file in which you want to insert your <q>include file</q>, as well as
            the <q>include file</q> itself, (<q>menu.html</q> in our example), upload them both to
            your project directory on newtFire the way you usually upload files. If you have a
            separate subdirectory for your included files, put the menu there and be sure that the
            include instruction points to it. You will have to do one more thing to make sure that
            your include is active:</p>
        <h3>Tell the web server about the include</h3>
        <p>By default the web server doesn’t process include instructions for all files, and
            newtFire is configured to process include instructions only for files with a
                <code>.html</code> extension. For your own future reference, how a server knows when to process
            include instructions and when not to can vary from host to host, and it is something to inquire about if you set up web space elsewhere. Our newtFire server
            is configured for your team project directoriees so that you need to set a special permissions configuration for the server to read SSI instsructions.
            To do that for <em>an HTML file that contains an inclusion instruction</em>,
            you need to <strong>set the x bit</strong>, which permits your file to execute a process (the including
            of the HTML for your menu). When a user attempts to load a file with the x bit set, the
            system knows that any include instructions inside it need to be processed. To do
            that:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Use WinSCP or FileZilla or SSH or whatever SFTP program you wish to access your project space on newtFire (see instructions posted on Courseweb). Navigate to your project space, which should involve your climbing a couple of steps above your home directory and then down into
              <code>/var/www/html/projectdir</code>.</li>
          <li>Once you are connected to your project space, upload your HTML file and your <q>include file</q>. Look at the permission attributes on your file in the space: most likely they are set to 
          rw-r--r--, a sequence of nine characters that indicates the file permissions in three sets of three: The first three are for the owner of the directory, the second three are for the group sharing access to the directory, and the third three are for the public:
          They may be set to rwx for the maximum permission, where <q>r</q> means <q>read</q> for reading access, <q>w</q> means <q>write</q> for permission to write or upload files to the directory space, and the last is the x-bit, or the <q>x</q>,
          which means <q>execute</q> and this is the one we need to set for each class of user so that when the webpage in question loads, the server is told that regardless of who is accessing the page it is okay to execute a server instruction (our SSI) indicated in the comment tags 
          within the page.</li>
          <li>Right-click on your file, or (depending on your system and the SFTP software you are using) click on it so that you can access a menu with options to change Properties or File Permissions. Click the three boxes for <q>Execute</q> in Owner, Group, and Public permissions to set the x-bit which now permits the server to execute your SSI commands.
          Here is an screen capture from FileZilla showing how the permissions should be set:
          <img src="xbitset.PNG" alt="setting the x-bit, FileZilla"/>
          </li>
      </ul>
        
  <!--ebb: David's command-line instructions for Obdurodon follow-->      
        <!--        <p>To do that for a file with a different extension that contains an inclusion instruction,
            you need to set the x bit, which permits your file to execute a process (the including
            of the HTML for your menu). When a user attempts to load a file with the x bit set, the
            system knows that any include instructions inside it need to be processed. To do
            that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Create a command-line connection to Obdurodon. On a PC, you can do that with the SSH
                client that you use to upload files. On a Mac, launch the <dfn>Terminal</dfn>
                application, which will open a command-line session on your Mac. Inside that window,
                type <q>ssh -l youruserid -p portnumber obdurodon.org</q> (replacing
                    <q>youruserid</q> with your actual userid on Obdurodon and <q>portnumber</q>
                with the port number you use for file transfers of Obdurodon [which we don’t
                publicize for security reasons]). This will connect you to Obdurodon, where you’ll
                be prompted for your password. If you are asked to accept the session, you should do
                so.</li>
            <li>Once you are connected to Obdurodon, you’ll see a <dfn>command line prompt.</dfn> At
                the prompt, you need to move to your project directory, which you do by typing <q>cd
                    /var/www/html/projectdir</q> and hitting the <q>Enter</q> key (<q>cd</q> stands
                for <q>change directory</q>, and you’ll have to replace <q>projectdir</q> with the
                actual name of your project directory). You can verify that you’ve landed there by
                typing <q>pwd</q> (<dfn>print working directory</dfn>), which should display
                    <q>/var/www/html/projectdir</q>.</li>
            <li>Once you’ve moved to your project directory, type <q>chmod +x filename.html</q>,
                replacing <q>filename.html</q> with the actual name of the file into which you would
                like the system to insert your menu or other text. This step <q>sets the x bit</q>
                on that file, telling the server <q>when someone asks for this page, process any
                    inclusion instructions before you return the page to the user</q>.</li>
        </ul>-->
        <p>Once you’ve uploaded the files, you can test the results by loading the page in a web
            browser. The text from the included file should appear in place of the include
            instruction.</p>
        <h3>Setting up SSIs in HTML files you create with XSLT</h3>
        <p>The preceding strategy is fine when you type up your HTML directly in &lt;oXygen/&gt;,
            but how about when you use XSLT to generate the HTML? You can’t just write the include
            instruction like a literal result because the XSLT that does the processing will think
            (correctly) that it’s a comment, and won’t copy it into the output.</p>
        <p>The way you work around this is with a <dfn>comment constructor</dfn>, along the lines
            of:</p>
        <pre>&lt;xsl:comment&gt;#include virtual="menu.html" &lt;/xsl:comment&gt;</pre>
        <p>The preceding code tells the XSLT processor <q>create an XML comment in the output at
                this location, and set its contents to whatever the contents of the
                    <code>&lt;xsl:comment&gt;</code> element might be</q>.</p>
        <h3>Other SSI functionality, and a note about security</h3>
        <p>The main use we make of SSIs involves inserted HTML fragments, as in the menu example
            above, but SSIs have additional functionality, which you can read about at <a
                href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/howto/ssi.html"
