      <p>Again for this exercise, we'll be working with our XML of Georg Forster's voyage
         				narrative. Download the XML file I have linked here: <a href="ForsterGeorgComplete.xml">ForsterGeorgComplete.xml</a>. Open the file in
         				oXygen and work with the XPath 2.0 Window. Respond to the XPath questions below
         in a
         				text file, and <a href="http://courseweb.pitt.edu">upload to Courseweb</a> for this
         				assignment when you're finished. (Please use an attachment! If you paste your
         answer
         				into the text box, CourseWeb may munch your brackets.) Some of these tasks are
         				thought-provoking, and even difficult. If you get stuck, do the best you can,
         and if
         				you can’t get a working answer, give the answers you tried and explain where they
         				failed to get the results you wanted. Sometimes doing that will help you figure
         out
         				what’s wrong, and even when it doesn’t, it will help us identify the difficult
         				moments.
      </p>
      			
      <p>These tasks require the use of <b>path expressions, predicates, and the functions
            					count(), not(), name(), and distinct-values()</b>, but they should not require
         				any other XPath functions. There may be more than one possible answer. You may
         find
         class notes and our introductory guide <cite class="sub"><a href="explainXPath.html">Follow the
            XPath!</a></cite> a helpful resource as you proceed. With the Georg
         				Forster file open in oXygen and using the XPath 2.0 browser window in oXygen,
         				construct XPath expressions that will do the following. <b>Be sure to give the FULL
            					XPath expression you used in your answer, and don't just report your
            					results.</b> This way, if the answer is incorrect, we can help explain what went
         				wrong.
      </p>
      			
      <p>Georg Forster often took note of when latitude and longitude coordinates were
         				measured during his trip with Captain Cook. We've spent some time capturing and
         				coding these (with help from regular expressions!), and now we can use XPath to
         work
         				with our geographic coordinates. We've used <span class="code">&lt;geo
            					select="lat"&gt;</span> for latitude readings, and <span class="code">&lt;geo
            					select="lon"&gt;</span> for longitude readings.
      </p>
      			
      <ol>
         				
         <li>Write an XPath expression to locate all the geo elements in Book I that contain
            					latitude measurements. How many are there (only in Book I)? Check the number
            in
            					the oXygen result window (Description line) if you like. Be careful if you use
            					the count() function here that you're getting only the count in Book I.
         </li>
         				
         <li>These latitude measurements you've just looked up are all held inside
            					paragraphs, or the <span class="code">&lt;geo select="lat"&gt;</span> element.
            					What would you add to the previous XPath expression to return the paragraphs
            					that hold latitude measurements in Book I? Give your complete XPath expression
            					here. 
         </li>
         				
         <li>Write an XPath expression to find the first paragraph in Book III, Chapter 1
            					that contains a latitude reading. What's the number of this paragraph as coded
            					in the file?
         </li>
         				
         <li>Write an XPath to bring up all the paragraphs in this WHOLE file that contain
            					both latitude AND longitude readings. How many of these paragraphs are
            					there?
         </li>
         				
         <li>Are there any paragraphs in this WHOLE file that do NOT have a latitude
            					measurement, but DO have a longitude? What XPath expression reveals these? And
            					how many of these paragraphs are there? <br /><br /></li>
         
         
         
         				
         <li>Explain why the following two XPath expressions return different results. Run
            					each XPath expression, review the results, and explain what you think each
            					expression is returning. 
            <ul>
               						
               <li><span class="code">//p[geo]/placeName[1]</span></li>
               						
               <li><span class="code">(//p[geo]/placeName)[1]</span><br /><br /></li>
               					
            </ul>
         </li>
         			
      </ol>
