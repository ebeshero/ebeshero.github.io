      <h1><span class="banner">JavaScript Exercise 1</span></h1>
      				
      				
      				
      				
      
      <p>Begin this exercise by carefully reading and testing the examples on Obdurodon’s introductory
         <cite class="sub"><a href="http://dh.obdurodon.org/javascript.html">JavaScript Overview page</a></cite>. When you get the section titled, <q>Okay, Time to Write your First JavaScript</q>, we’d
         like you to do just that: experiment with what you have learned so far by writing
         some JavaScript code to work within an HTML page you have prepared. Your page could
         be an HTML file you have generated for your project, or just a random page you write
         on the fly for the purposes of this assignment, but should not simply be a repetition
         of the model on the Obdurodon intro page. (Adapt what you’ve learned there to experiment
         a little on your own.) For more examples to tinker with, have a look at <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp">the JavaScript tutorial pages at w3schools</a>. Don’t worry too much about making this complicated: We just want to see you achieving
         some functional JavaScript code.
         
      </p>
      			
      				
      
      <p>Note: We don’t expect anyone here to have written <q>angle bracket</q> code before joining
         our class, but some of you may well have come in with some background in JavaScript
         already. If that is the case, go on and <a href="http://dh.obdurodon.org/javascript-assignment-01.xhtml">do this exercise instead</a>, or write some JavaScript for one of your project pages that makes something dynamic
         happen (and note well: we don’t permit the use of JavaScript libraries—just using
         someone else’s JavaScript—because we want you to write your own code independently
         and know what each line of it means). 
         
      </p>
      				
      
      <p><strong>What to upload on Courseweb:</strong> Upload your HTML page with the JavaScript. (For this introductory exercise we expect
         that you’ll probably do this as a single HTML file with JavaScript you’ve written
         inside. However, we welcome you to write your JavaScript as a separate .js file that
         you link to your HTML page if you’re up on this, are reading about it, and want to
         give it a try. We will be showing you how to write JavaScript as a separate file in
         class, and that will be our standard operating procedure for projects.)
