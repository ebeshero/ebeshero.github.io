        <section title="preliminaries"><h3>Preliminaries</h3>
        <p>Before beginning this assignment please thoroughly read our tutorials: "<a
                href="explainHTML.html">Introduction to XHTML (and HTML)</a>" and "<a
                href="explainCSS.html">Introduction to Cascading Stylesheets (CSS)</a>". It will
            benefit you to keep these tutorials open while you work on this assignment. To begin,
            open a new XHTML file in &lt;oXygen/&gt; under <strong>File → New → Framework Templates
                → (scroll to XHTML in the alphabetized list) → XHTML 5</strong>. We do not recommend keeping the xml line at the very top, but just the DOCTYPE and the root html element pointing to the xhtml namespace; therefore, the top of your file should look like this:</p> 
            <pre>
                     &lt;!DOCTYPE html
  SYSTEM "about:legacy-compat"&gt;
&lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;
                      
                  </pre>
            <p>You will also need
            to open a new CSS file in &lt;oXygen/&gt; under <strong>File → New → New Document →
                CSS</strong>.</p></section>
        <section title="analysis_of_task"><h3>Analysis of the task</h3>
        <p>The goal of this assignment is to create a very basic personal webpage. If you <em>view page source</em> on this page you can see examples of how we added headings, paragraphs, lists,  an image, and links to other pages within the same directory. You can also view the corresponding CSS and how we linked our CSS with this page. Mac users to view page source we recommend that you use Firefox or Chrome because Safari will require you to change browser preferences to see the page source. In Firefox and Chrome simply <em>right-click</em> and click <em>view page source</em>.</p>
        <p>The key components of your first basic webpage that we will be looking for are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Heading elements (with any variation of heading levels)</li>
            <li>Paragraph element(s)</li>
            <li>Linking at least one image</li>
            <li>Corresponding styling for the entire content of the page</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We encourage you to go above and beyond these very basic requirements, and indeed in <a href="HTMLExercise2.html">Exercise
            2</a> we will expect to see a more completed web site.</p>
        <h3>Viewing your webpage locally</h3>
        <p>While developing your webpage it is important to consistently check your changes. Follow
            these three simple steps to open your webpage locally in your web browser:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>open your browser</li>
            <li>on Windows: <code>control + o</code>
                <br/>
                on Mac: <code>command + o</code>
            </li>
            <li>browse your local file explorer for your webpage</li>
        </ol></section>
       <section title="how_to_submit"> <h3>Submitting your work</h3>
        <p><em>A note on mindful file management:</em> We recommend you save your CSS stylesheet in
            the same directory with your HTML pages, because then you simply need to indicate the filename in the <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element that sits in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element of each HTML page. The same applies for pages that are linked from other pages. Otherwise, you will need to declare the folder (directory) followed by a <code>/</code> and then the filename. Mindful file management is a key component of creating a well organized website.</p>
        <p>By convention, the first page you place in your website folder is designated your index.html page. You don’t have to have an index.html, but if you do, the main page of your site can be abbreviated to the name of the site directory holding the web files, like this one for Dr. Beshero-Bondar’s personal Pitt homepage: http://www.pitt.edu/~ebb8/ . By default, when given that address, the web browser retrieves the index.html file placed in her account’s space, and if it doesn’t find one it generates an error. (The site address leads to exactly the same place as http://www.pitt.edu/~ebb8/index.html .) By assigning any other name to your homepage someone visiting your site is required to call on that specific file/file path to get to your homepage. For this assignment please name your homepage <code>index.html</code>.</p>
        <p>Access your personal web space accounts at newtFire.org on the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center using your preferred file transfer program. Move all of your developed HTML pages and your CSS file into the <code>public_html</code> folder. Be sure the file permissions on your main folder allow the group and others to Read and Execute. You (the owner) should be the only one able to write to this directory. The following image shows how to access file permissions and our recommended settings using WinSCP on a Windows machine; however, the setup should be similar on other platforms and in other file transfer programs.</p>
