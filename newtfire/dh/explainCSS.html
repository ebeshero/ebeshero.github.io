      <h1><span class="banner">Introduction to Cascading Stylesheets (CSS)</span></h1>
      			
      
      <!--<h3> for subheadings when you need them.</h3>-->
      			
      
      <p>Here we offer a very basic orientation to styling HTML elements with Cascading
         				Stylesheets (CSS), with emphasis on learning how to write the code and associate
         it
         				with an XHTML (or HTML) file. This is designed to follow our <a href="explainHTML.html">Introduction to XHTML (and HTML)</a>. After the basic
         				orientation, we provide links to resources with comprehensive information on CSS
         				code, resources that we rely on as we style our own projects.
         
      </p>
      			
      
      <p>As HTML developed in the 1990s, more and more tags were added to control display and
         				layout: Presentation features like color coding, font size, font weight, etc,
         were
         				built into an increasingly bloated language (as in, HTML 3.2 was ailing from
         				“code bloat”). To resolve the problem <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/">the
            					W3C (World Wide Web Consortium)</a> developed CSS as a form of code designed to
         				be held in a separate file, and to control presentation elements across multiple
         				pages or whole sites. The idea was to streamline HTML, to keep it simple and
         				readable, and also to make it easy to change the style of pages quickly and
         				efficiently. 
         
      </p>
      			
      
      <p>CSS is not the only means to style HTML. We’ll also be learning to write XSLT
         				(eXtensible Stylesheet Language Transformation) which is a powerful XML-based
         				stylesheet system for generating HTML and XML. XSLT has powers that CSS lacks,
         				specifically to remix, extract, and even rename elements from one file to generate
         				entirely new files. By contrast, CSS is fairly simple: You write it to identify
         HTML
         				elements and indicate something to be done with them: to give them a specific
         color,
         				or a width, or a margin, etc. In our projects we use both XSLT and CSS together
         to
         				build and design our sites.
         
      </p>
      			
      
      <h3>How to Write CSS</h3>
      			
      
      <p>To begin a new CSS document in &lt;oXygen/&gt;, <strong>go to File → New → New
            					Document, and choose CSS</strong>. You'll open a blank file into which you can
         				start writing CSS rules as we describe below. Sometimes it helps to start with
         				someone else’s CSS code to get a sense of how it works. Try taking a look at
         					<a href="explain.css">our CSS for this page</a>, and if you like, save the
         				CSS file locally ihe same file directory with this very XHTML page you are reading.
         				You can then play around with altering our CSS rules, and viewing the effects
         				locally in your web browser. (Can you change the background color for a portion
         of
         				the page?)
         
      </p>
      			
      
      <p>First of all, think about your approach, working from the top level elements down:
         				Work from the root “down” through the tree (like how we write schema
         				rules). The difference from writing schemas is that <strong>we don’t have to
            					write rules for every element</strong> and <strong>our rules can be written in
            					any order</strong> (though it helps make the code human-readable to keep it
         				organized in something like the order of the HTML elements). One thing to realize
         is
         				that if you place a style on a top-level element, like, say, to establish a text
         				color on the whole &lt;body&gt; element, that will control ALL the text in all the
         				“children” and “grandchildren” and
         				“great-grandchildren” (etc.) elements nested inside &lt;body&gt;. This
         				is a handy property of CSS called <strong>inheritance</strong>.
         
      </p>
      			
      
      <p>You can always borrow someone else’s stylesheet rules if you admire a color
         				or something of the layout. CSS is often easy to adapt and retool from sites you
         				discover on the web, just by right-clicking to view the page source (or selecting
         				view page source from your browser menu options), because the link to the associated
         				stylesheet makes it available to read and download from the page source view.
         Even
         				more conveniently, CSS resources make default styles available for download, like
      	<a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/">CSS Zen Garden</a>. But as you learn to write
         				CSS, we expect you will find it as addictive as we do, in the fun obsession of
         				designing a lovely site all your own.
         
      </p>
      			
      
      <h3>CSS Statements</h3>
      			
      
      <p>CSS statements take this basic form, with a <span class="red">selector</span>
         				followed a statement in curly braces <span class="code">{ }</span> containing a
         					<span class="purple">property</span>, and a <span class="green">value</span>: 
         
      </p>
      			
      
      <div class="code">
         				<span class="red">body</span> { <br />
         				<span class="purple">background-color:</span>
         				<span class="green">#CC9966</span>;<br />
         				<span class="purple">color:</span>
         				<span class="green">#70003D</span>;<br />
         				<span class="purple">font-family:</span>
         				<span class="green">arial, helvetica, sans-serif</span>;<br /> } 
         
      </div>
      			
      
      <p>Notice how each property and value expression is separated by a mandatory semicolon
         (
         					<strong>;</strong> )! You don't have to stack the curly braces as we did, but
         				it's conventional to do that because it makes it easy to add new properties and
         				values line by line, making it easy to read. We've specified the following
         				properties for the <span class="code">body</span> element (and by the
         					<strong>inheritance</strong> rule) all the descendent elements within <span class="code">body</span>:
         
      </p>
      			
      
      <ul>
         				
         
         <li>The background color will be a particular hexadecimal color value (a value made
            					of three 2-digit numbers in the base-16 hexadecimal system, which combines
            					digits and letters. These designate a color by <strong>RGB</strong> factors: The
            					first two numbers indicate the red values, the second two indicate green values,
            					and the last two indicate blue. and letters representing red, green, and blue
            					(RGB) color values.
            
         </li>
         				
         
         <li>The "color" indicates the font color, again designated with a hexadecimal value
            					here. (Other color value systems are fine, too. We're just used to the
            					hexadecimal system, and working with this <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_colormixer.asp">this handy HTML
               						Color Mixer</a> which generates hexadecimal color values.
            
         </li>
         				
         
         <li>The font is defined, and notice it's a font-family, with a first choice, a
            					second, and a third choice. It's a good practice to designate font families in
            					CSS in case a particular browser doesn't know a font you want to use. The
            					browser can default to another that you specific is part of the same
            					“family.” 
            
         </li>
         			
         
      </ul>
      			
      
      <p>You can fine-tune your selection of elements and attributes together using
         					<strong>pseudo-selectors</strong>. We demonstrate this in the following example,
         				courtesy of Obdurodon. If you wanted a particular rule to style only the <span class="code">&lt;title type="poem"&gt;</span> elements when there are other
         				kinds of title elements present, you would need to specify the <span class="code">@type="poem"</span> in your CSS rule, using a pseudo-selector inside square
         				brackets <span class="code">[ ]</span>. In this handy rule, we specify that the
         				contents of this element be surrounded by typographic (curly) quotation marks
         so we
         				do not have to find the special characters for those in writing the HTML: 
         
      </p>
      			
      
      <div class="code"> title<span class="red">[type = "poem"]</span>: before {<br /> content
         				: "“";<br /> }<br /> title<span class="red">[type = "poem"]</span>: after {<br />
         				content : "”";<br /> } 
         
      </div>
      			
      
      <p>This is an unusual statement for another reason: We can specify what we want to
         				appear <span class="code">before</span> and <span class="code">after</span> an
         				element, using the syntax we’ve modelled here. 
         
      </p>
      			
      
      <p>You can make up your own element and attribute names and decide on acceptable values
         				in your XML schema, but you can’t make up XHTML element names or CSS properties
         or
         				acceptable values. E.g., if you try to set the color of an element to
         				“OutrageousNeonYellow!”, that setting will be ignored. You can look up the legal
         				properties and values from <a href="#resources">our Resources section below</a>.
         
      </p>
      			
      
      <h3>Associating a CSS File with an HTML File</h3>
      			
      
      <p>When we write a separate CSS file to style an HTML file, we need to
         					<strong>associate</strong> it with the HTML by placing a special &lt;:link&gt;
         				element inside the &lt;head&gt; element. The code looks like this, and we recommend
         				simply copying and pasting this into your own &lt;head&gt; element and replacing the
         				dummy.css filename with the name of your own CSS file:
         
      </p>
      			
      
      <div class="code"> &lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css"/&gt; </div>
      			
      
      <p>Here's what the various parts of this element indicate: <span class="code">@rel</span> says what kind of link association this is: stylesheet is but one
         				option. <span class="code">@type</span> indicates the kind of stylesheet, text-based
         				CSS (as, again, there are others in the known web universe). Finally, we have
         the
         					<span class="code">@href</span>, which you might remember as the same attribute
         				used on the HTML element <span class="code">&lt;a&gt;</span> to indicate a link
         				address. This is the part where you specify the name of your file, which depends
         on
         				its location and its name.
         
      </p>
      			
      
      <p><em>A note on mindful file management:</em> We recommend you save your stylesheets in
         				the same directory with your HTML, because then you simply indicate the filename.
         				Sometimes people stash their stylesheets in a subdirectory (a folder within the
         web
         				folder) and name it, for example, css: If you do that, you just need to create
         a
         				path to the file in your link statement, indicating the directory name, a forward
         				slash and the filename: e.g., <span class="code">href="css/style.css"</span>. The
         				value of the @href attribute can also be a URL, that is, a web address, as in
         <span class="code">href="http://www.pitt.edu/~ebb8/index.css"</span> .<span class="smaller">You can actually write CSS to style XML for web presentation! If
            					you want to give it a try, the way you associate the files is a little
            					different: To attach CSS to XML in &lt;oXygen/&gt;, select Document → XML
            					Document → Associate XSLT/CSS Stylesheet and navigate to the CSS file.
            					&lt;oXygen/&gt; then inserts a line near the top of your document to make the
            					file association. </span></p>
