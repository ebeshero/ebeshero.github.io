      <h1><span class="banner">XSLT Exercise 4</span></h1>
      
      
      <h3>The input text</h3>
      
      
      <p>For this assignment we’ll be using an XML file originally prepared by students in
         the Nell Nelson project team last fall. 
         We’ve modified it for use in this XSLT exercise, and the new version
         is available here at <a href="NelsonArticle_1888-07-30.xml">http://newtfire.org/dh/NelsonArticle_1888-07-30.xml</a>. You should
         right-click on this link, download the file, and open it in &lt;oXygen/&gt;.
      </p>
      
      <h3>The usual housekeeping:</h3>       
      
      <p>Because this document is not in a namespace, we do not need the <code>@xpath-default-namespace</code> attribute, and the only thing we need to add to &lt;oXygen&gt;’s default XSLT stylesheet
         template is a namespace for the xhtml output. We also add our usual <code>&lt;xsl:output&gt;</code> line that we use when producing HTML (for making sure we produce valid HTML 5 in
         XHTML format). Here’s what we need:
      </p>
      <pre>
          &lt;xsl:stylesheet xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"
    xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"
    xmlns:math="http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions/math" exclude-result-prefixes="xs math"
    <span style="color:blue;">xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" version="3.0"</span>&gt;
    <span style="color:purple;">&lt;xsl:output method="xhtml" encoding="utf-8" doctype-system="about:legacy-compat"
        omit-xml-declaration="yes"/&gt;</span>
            
        </pre>
      
      <h3>Overview of the assignment</h3>
      
      
      <p>For this assignment we’re going to work with this entire document (on all levels of
         the hierarchy),
         concentrating on processing the in-line elements to style the text. You can use some
         of
         the basic HTML in-line elements, like <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> for emphasis or
         <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> for strong emphasis, but you’ll also want to use CSS to
         set some elements to have different colors or background colors or borders or fonts
         or font
         sizes or font styles (e.g., italic) or font weights (e.g., bold) or text decoration
         (e.g., underlining) or text transformation (e.g., convert to all upper case) … well
         …
         anything else. We describe below how to do that.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>There are several types of in-line elements in the input XML document, for the purposes
         of this assignment we will focus on these few:
      </p>
      
      <ul>
         
         <li><code>&lt;unclear&gt;</code> This element will require special attention (described below)!
         </li>
         
         
         <li><code>&lt;headLine&gt;</code></li>
         
         
         <li><code>&lt;workingConditions&gt;</code> For the purpose of this assignment we only want you to grab this element when it
            appears inside of the <code>&lt;articleBody&gt;</code> element.
         </li>
         
         
         <li><code>&lt;dialogue&gt;</code></li>
         
         
         <li><code>&lt;femVoice&gt;</code> For the purpose of this assignment we only want you to process this element when
            it appears inside of the <code>&lt;dialogue&gt;</code> element. 
         </li>
         
         
         <li><code>&lt;nellVoice&gt;</code> For the purpose of this assignment we only want you to process this element when
            it appears inside of the <code>&lt;dialogue&gt;</code> element.
         </li>
         
         
         <li><code>&lt;mascVoice&gt;</code> For the purpose of this assignment we only want you to process this element when
            it appears inside of the <code>&lt;dialogue&gt;</code> element.
         </li>           
         
         
         <li><code>&lt;company&gt;</code> For the purpose of this assignment only style the company names that have the attribute
            and value <code>@name="identified"</code>.
         </li>
         
      </ul>
      
      
      <p>Some are immediately inside  <code>&lt;articleBody&gt;</code> (like <code>&lt;workingConditions&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;unclear&gt;</code>). While others sit inside other in-line elements like all of the voice tags sitting
         inside of <code>&lt;dialogue&gt;</code> elements or <code>&lt;headLine&gt;</code> elements that sit inside the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element. You may not know at the outset which ones can be inside which other ones,
         or how deeply they can nest. Happily, with XSLT, unlike with many other programming
         languages, you don’t need to care about those questions!
      </p>        
      
      
      <p>An example of possible desired output can be found here <a href="1888-07-30_XSLTresults.html">http://newtfire.org/dh/1888-07-30_XSLTresults.html</a>. It is important to note that the majority of the styling choices on this file are
         controlled with a CSS file. You will make your own CSS and relate it to your XSLT;
         therefore, your stylistic choices might vary greatly from ours and your ouput may
         look completely different. What should look relatively similar is the underlying raw
         HTML, which is generated by running the XSLT. By viewing the page source of our output
         you can review the underlying raw HTML (<a href="view-source:http://newtfire.org/dh/1888-07-30_XSLTresults.html">view-source:http://newtfire.org/dh/1888-07-30_XSLTresults.html</a>).

      <h3>Analysis of the task</h3>
      
      
      <h4>How to process richly mixed content</h4>
      
      
      <p>Prose paragraphs with in-line elements that might contain other in-line elements are
         richly mixed content, with varied and unpredictable combinations of elements and plain
         text. This is the problem that XSLT was designed to solve. With a traditional procedural
         programming language, you’d have to write rules like <q>inside this paragraph, if there’s a <code>&lt;dialogue&gt;</code> do X, and, oh, by the way, check whether there’s a <code>&lt;nellVoice&gt;</code> or a <code>&lt;company&gt;</code> inside the <code>&lt;dialogue&gt;</code>, etc.</q> That is, most programming languages have to tell you what to look for at every step.
         The elegance of XSLT when dealing with this type of data is that all you have to say
         inside paragraphs and other elements is <q>I’m not worried about what I'll find here; just process <strong>(apply templates to)</strong> all my children, whatever they might be.</q></p>
      
      
      <p>The way to deal with mixed content in XSLT is to have a template rule for every element
         and use it to output whatever HTML markup you want for that element and then, inside
         that markup, to include a general <code>&lt;xsl:apply-templates/&gt;</code>, not specifying a <code>@select</code> attribute. For example, if you want your <code>&lt;nellVoice&gt;</code> to be tagged with the HTML <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> tags, which means <q>strong emphasis</q> and which is usually rendered in bold, you could have a template rule like:
      </p>
      
      <pre>&lt;xsl:template match="nellVoice"&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;
      &lt;xsl:apply-templates/&gt;
  &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/xsl:template&gt;</pre>
      
      <p>You don’t know or care whether <code>&lt;nellVoice&gt;</code> has any child nodes or, if it does, what they are. Whatever they are, this rule tells
         the system to try to process them, and as long as there’s a template rule for them,
         they’ll get taken care of properly somewhere else in the stylesheet. If there are
         no child nodes, the <code>&lt;xsl:apply-templates/&gt;</code> will apply vacuously and harmlessly. As long as every element tells you to process
         its children, you’ll work your way down through the hierarchy of the paragraph without
         having to know which elements can contain which other elements or text nodes.
      </p>
      
      
      <h4>Taking stock: when to use <code>@select</code></h4>
      
      
      <p>In an earlier XSLT assignment, where you built HTML tables, you used <code>&lt;xsl:apply-templates select="…"/&gt;</code>, specifying exactly what you wanted to process where. That makes sense when your
         input and output (an HTML table) are very regular in structure. <em>Use the <code>@select</code> attribute when you know exactly what you’re looking for and where you want to put
            it.</em> We will want to use <code>&lt;xsl:apply-templates select="…"/&gt;</code> in order to grab all of the <code>&lt;headline&gt;</code> elements sitting inside of the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element and to output them inside of the HTML elements at the beginning of your XSLT
         transformation separate from the <code>&lt;articleBody&gt;</code> text. We will also want to use the <code>&lt;xsl:apply-templates select="…"/&gt;</code> in order to place the rest of the source text sitting inside of <code>&lt;articleBody&gt;</code> into a <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element. By setting up these very specific selections of some of the elements we
         are deciding the placement of where the headlines of the source document sit in relation
         to the rest of the text found in <code>&lt;articleBody&gt;</code> for our HTML output. It would also be logical to add heading elements in the HTML
         portion of our XSLT to indicate placement of the <code>&lt;newspaperTitle&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;seriesTitle&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;date&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;byline&gt;</code> elements. Consider where each of these elements' placements make sense in relation
         to the <code>&lt;headline&gt;</code> elements and the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element containing the text from the <code>&lt;articleBody&gt;</code> element. It is important to note that the <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> element inside of the HTML <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element of your XSLT will not appear on the HTML page like the heading elements do;
         there is a difference!
      </p>
      
      
      <p>For the rest of this assignment, you don’t know (and don’t need to know) the order
         and nesting hierarchy of whatever salad of elements and plain text you might find
         inside <code>&lt;articleBody&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> or its subelements. You just want to process whatever comes up whenever it comes
         up. <code>&lt;xsl:apply-templates/&gt;</code> without the <code>@select</code> attribute says <q>apply templates to whatever you find.</q> <em>Omit the <code>@select</code> attribute where you don’t want to have to think about and cater to every alternative
            individually.</em> (You can still treat them all differently because you’ll have different template
         rules to <q>catch</q> them, but when you assert that they should be processed, you don’t have to know what
         they actually are.)
      </p>
      
      
      <h4>What should the output look like</h4>
      
      
      <p>HTML provides a limited number of elements for styling in-line text, which you can
         read about at <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_formatting.asp">http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_formatting.asp</a>. You can use any of these in your output, but note that presentational elements,
         the kind that describe how text looks (e.g., <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> for <q>italic</q>), are generally regarded as less useful than descriptive tags, which describe what
         text means (e.g., <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> for <q>emphasis</q>). Both of the preceding are normally rendered in italics in the browser, but the
         semantic tag is more consistent with the spirit of XML than the presentational one.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>The web would be a dull world if the only styling available were the handful of presentational
         tags available in vanilla HTML. In addition to those options, there are also ways
         to assign arbitrary style to a snippet of in-line text, changing fonts or colors or
         other features in mid-stream. To do that:
      </p>
      
      
      <ol>
         
         <li>
            <p>Before you read any further in this page, read Obdurodon's <a href="http://dh.obdurodon.org/class-and-span.html">Using
                  <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> and <code>@class</code> to style your HTML</a>
               page.
            </p>
         </li>
         
         
         <li>
            <p>To use the strategies described at that page, create an XSLT template rule that
               transforms the element you want to style to an HTML <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>
               element with a <code>@class</code> attribute. For example, you might transform
               <code>&lt;nellVoice&gt;</code> in
               the input XML to 
               
               <code>&lt;span
                  class="nellVoice"&gt;</code>...text node...<code>&lt;/span&gt;</code>
               
               in the output HTML. You can then specify CSS styling by reference to the <code>@class</code> attribute,
               as described in the page we link to above.
            </p>
            
            
            <ul>
               
               <li>Note that you can make your transformations very specific. For example,
                  instead of setting all <code>&lt;workingConditions&gt;</code> elements to the same
                  HTML <code>@class</code>, you can create separate template rules to match on
                  workingConditions according to their attribute values. For example,
                  <code>&lt;xsl:template match="workingConditions[@category='positive']"&gt;</code> is
                  a normal XPath expression to match <code>&lt;workingConditions&gt;</code> elements
                  only if they have a <code>@category</code> attribute with the value
                  <q>positive</q>.
               </li>
               
               
               <li>To really exercise your XPath skills try this:
                  
                  <p>Note that directly inside of the <code>&lt;root&gt;</code> element in the <code>&lt;toneElements&gt;</code> the working conditions are described (with an <code>@tone</code> attribute) with values of <q>good</q>, <q>bad</q>, or <q>neutral</q>. You can write a <strong>matching rule</strong> that will <dfn>dereference</dfn> the <code>@category</code> attribute on, say, <code>&lt;workingConditions category="positve"&gt;...text node...&lt;/workingConditions&gt;</code>, look up whether this is a good, bad, or neutral tone, and set the <code>@class</code> value accordingly. You could make all good working Conditions one color and all bad
                     working conditions a different color, letting XPath look up the tone reference for
                     you.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>A similar <dfn>dereference</dfn> can be made with the <code>@connotation</code> attribute on the variety of voice tags (<code>&lt;femVoice&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;nellVoice&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;mascVoice&gt;</code>).
                  </p>
                  
               </li>
               
            </ul>
            
         </li>
         
         <li>
            <p>Setting the <code>@class</code> attributes in the output HTML makes it possible
               to style the various <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> elements differently according to
               the value of those attributes, but you need to create a CSS stylesheet to do
               that. Create the stylesheet (just as you‘ve created CSS in the past), and
               specify how you want to style your <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> elements. Link the
               CSS stylesheet to the XSLT by creating the appropriate
               <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element inside of the HTML  <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element of your XSLT (you can remind
               yourself of the <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element format by referencing the bottom of Obdurodon's <a href="http://dh.obdurodon.org/css-intro.xhtml">Introduction to
                  CSS</a>).
            </p>
         </li>
         
         <li>
            <p>Besides wrapping your <code>&lt;xsl:apply-templates/&gt;</code> in <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> elements and other HTML elements (Hint: including HTML heading elements say if you
               want each of your <code>&lt;headLine&gt;</code> elements to appear as individual headings instead of block text) you might consider
               adding extra spaces or text outside some of these as well. For example, in our HTML
               output note that each of the voice tags have some added words appearing in front of
               each of the quoted speeches (where the sex of the speaker or if Nelson was the speaker
               is indicated). Also we added double <code>&lt;br/&gt;</code> elements to add space around the blocks of dialogue. Use what looks best for you
               and provides the most readable HTML output.                
               
            </p>
         </li>
         
      </ol>
      
      
      <p>The element <code>&lt;unclear&gt;</code> will need a slightly different rule <strong>matching</strong> on it. If you refer back to the source document and XPath your way to the empty self-closing
         <code>&lt;unclear/&gt;</code> elements, you might notice that the purpose of this element in the original document
         was to take place for word(s) that our project team was unable to transcribe from
         the bad imaging of the original source. We do not want to lose the information that
         there are words missing when we transform this document into HTML. Like all other
         elements the <code>&lt;unclear&gt;</code> element will disappear and therefore we will no longer have the marker telling the
         reader that there is a word missing here! Since <code>&lt;unclear&gt;</code> is an empty element, it contains no text of its own to process, so if we want to
         output anything in our HTML for it, we need to generate that text ourselves. To remedy
         this we want to write a template rule <strong>matching on <code>&lt;unclear&gt;</code></strong> and inside of that rule we want to include text to indicate there is a word missing,
         like this: <code>&lt;xsl:text&gt;</code>THEN TYPE WHATEVER TEXT/CHARACTERS TO INDICATE THE MISSING WORD(S)... we chose to
         write [missing word]...<code>&lt;/unclear&gt;</code>.  Check out our output to see the result of that template rule more clearly.
      </p>
      
      
      <h3>Your Final Results</h3>
      
      
      <p>What you should produce, then, is:</p>
      
      
      <ul>
         
         <li>An XSLT stylesheet that transforms the contents of the source document into HTML.
            Including placing the <code>&lt;headline&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;newspaperTitle&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;seriesTitle&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;date&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;byline&gt;</code> elements in relation to the <code>&lt;articleBody&gt;</code> text using HTML heading elements (<code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>, etc.) and a <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element.
         </li>
         
         
         <li>The resulting HTML should also style the eight different types of in-line elements
            listed above and at
            least some of those styles should be set using <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> elements
            with the <code>@class</code> attribute.
         </li>
         
         
         <li>You need to create a CSS file, linked to your output HTML, that specifies how to style
            the output document. You can look up the most useful of the available CSS properties
            at <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/">http://www.w3schools.com/css/</a>. We’d suggesting following the links on the left under <q>CSS styling</q> for styling backgrounds, text, and fonts, as well as the link for borders under <q>CSS box model</q>.
         </li>
         
         
         <li>We will be checking that you transform the <code>&lt;unclear&gt;</code> element. Your transformation shoud indicate the presence of missing text for every
            instance of the <code>&lt;unclear&gt;</code> element. 
         </li>
         
         
         <li>To complete the challenge question: <strong>FOR BONUS</strong>: you could test your XPath skills and link the tones of the voice elements <code>@connotation</code> attribute and/or the tones of the <code>&lt;workingConditions&gt;</code> <code>@category</code> attribute to produce <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> <code>@class</code> attributes that link to the three tones provided in the <code>&lt;toneElements&gt;</code> table at the top of the XML source document.

         <li><em>Before submitting your homework, you must run the transformation at home</em> to
            make sure the results are what you expect them to be. There’s a guide to running
            XSLT transformations inside &lt;oXygen/&gt; on Obdurodon at <a href="http://dh.obdurodon.org/oxygen-xslt-configuration.html" title="How to run a transformation in oXygen">http://dh.obdurodon.org/oxygen-xslt-configuration.html</a>. If you don’t get
            the results you expect and can’t figure out what you’re doing wrong, remember that
            you can post a query to our <a href="https://github.com/ebeshero/DHClass-Hub/issues">DHClass-Hub Issues board</a>. You can’t just ask for the answer,
            though; you need to describe what you tried, what you expected, what you got, and
            what you think the problem is. We often find, just as we’re preparing to post our
            own queries to coding discussion boards, that having to write up a description
            of the problem helps us think it through and solve it ourselves. We’re also
            encouraging you to discuss the homework on the discussion boards because that’s also
            helpful for the person who responds. Answering someone else’s
            inquiry and troubleshooting someone else’s problem often helps us clarify matters
            for
            ourselves!
         </li>
         
         
         <li>When you complete this assignment, you need to submit your XSLT file and CSS file
            to Courseweb, following our usual homework file-naming conventions. We will run your
            XSLT transformation to see what output it generates, so you do not need to submit
            your output file. However, it is important that you include your CSS so we can locally
            link it to your XSLT and see your final output. You should link the CSS in the XSLT
            for us!
