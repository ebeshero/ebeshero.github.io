                <!-- Construction & Decomission -->
                <p>Space Shuttle Discovery (Designated OV-103) was the third shuttle orbiter to join the fleet. It is the oldest shuttle still around (only two in service prior to Discovery were Columbia and Challenger) and has thus recorded the most spaceflights of any shuttle at 39. Discovery has spent over a year in space at a total spaceflight time of 1 year, 22 hours, 39 minutes, and 33 seconds. </p>
                <!-- Service Life & Noteable Missions-->
                <p>Discovery first launched in August 1984 and was retired in March of 2011. Discovery's noteable achievements include the Hubble Space Telescope, flying the 100th shuttle mission, being the first shuttle to dock with the International Space Station among many more. John Glenn Marine aviator, senator, astronaut, first American to orbit the Earth, and the oldest man to fly into space set the latter record aboard STS-95 at age 77 </p>
