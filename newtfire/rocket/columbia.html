                <p>Space Shuttle Columbia (Designated OV-102) was the first space-rated shuttle and the first orbiter to launch. STS-1 took off on April 12th, 1981 signaling the start of a new era in space flight. Columbia has a lot of firsts under her belt including but not limited to first mission, first re-use of a crewed space vehicle, first and only landing at White Sands, first flight with an unpainted external tank, and many more. On STS-107 durning launch part of the foam insulation from the external tank fell off and damaged protective heat tiles on the leading edge of the left wing resulting in loss of control and loss of the vehicle upon re-entry on Feburary 1st, 2003.
