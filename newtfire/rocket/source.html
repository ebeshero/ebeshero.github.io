            <p>The goal of this project was to create something that could catalog and what the shuttle was for and it's history. The goals were ambitious and still are. This represents only a fraction of what the countless men and women sacrificed in order to advance the entire world into a new era of space travel. Sadly though the era of the Space Shuttle has come to an end, and (at the time of writing) we approach the 10 year anniversery of the final flight returning home it is important to remeber the names of the 14 astronauts that lost their lives in the action of serving the greater world community as well as remebering all the astronauts and cosmonauts that have paid the ultimate price. Two pieces of art are on display to commerate these brave men and women, the first being placed on the moon in 1971 by the crew of Apollo 15 detailed <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/there-is-a-sculpture-on-the-moon-commemorating-fallen-astronauts-358909/">here</a>. Along with a second dedicated in 1991 that has been updated with every life lost in the ever forward pursuit of spaceflight detailed <a href="https://www.kennedyspacecenter.com/explore-attractions/all-attractions/space-mirror-memorial">here</a>.</p>
