                    I am a commuter student at the University of Pittsburgh at Greensburg persuing a degree in Information Technology. You can acess my GitHub <a href="https://github.com/robftg">here</a>. <br/><br/> This project was only made possibly by the help of everyone in the DHClass who had input or assistance to offer, aswell as the occassional sleepless night to get to the finish line.
