            <h3>Preliminaries</h3>
            <p>Before beginning this assignment please thoroughly read our tutorials: "<a
                    href="explainHTML.html">Introduction to XHTML (and HTML)</a>" and "<a
                    href="explainCSS.html">Introduction to Cascading Stylesheets (CSS)</a>". It will
                benefit you to keep these tutorials open while you work on this assignment. To
                begin, open a new HTML file in &lt;oXygen/&gt; by clicking on the icon that looks like a piece of paper in the top left (or going to <strong>File → New</strong>, entering <code>HTML</code> in the search bar, and clicking on the HTML result. Paste in the highlighted meta elements below at the appropriate place in the <code>head</code> element at the start of your file:</p>
            <pre>
                &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;
            &lt;head&gt;
                  &lt;title&gt;&lt;!--title of your page here--&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
                 <code>&lt;meta charset="UTF-8" /&gt;
                  &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" /&gt;</code>
                &lt;!--Add your &lt;link&gt; element to associate your CSS file here once you have created it.-->
             &lt;/head&gt;
                 &lt;body&gt;
                 &lt;!--Code the viewable portion of your page here.--&gt;
                 &lt;/body&gt;
                  </pre>
            <p>You will also need to open a new CSS file in &lt;oXygen/&gt; under <strong>File → New
                    → New Document → CSS</strong>.</p>

            <h3>Analysis of the task</h3>
            <p>The goal of this assignment is to create a very basic personal webpage. If you
                    <em>view page source</em> on this page you can see examples of how we used
                headings, paragraphs, lists, an image, and links to other pages within the same
                directory. You can also view the corresponding CSS and <strong>take note of how we linked
                our CSS with this page</strong>. Mac users to view page source we recommend that you use
                Firefox or Chrome because Safari will require you to change browser preferences to
                see the page source. In Firefox or Chrome simply <em>right-click</em> and select
                    <em>view page source</em>.</p>
            <p>The key components of your first basic webpage that we will be looking for are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Heading elements (with any variation of heading levels)</li>
                <li>Paragraph element(s)</li>
                <li>Linking at least one image</li>
                <li>Corresponding styling for the entire content of the page</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We encourage you to go above and beyond these very basic requirements, and indeed in
                    <a href="HTMLExercise2.html">Exercise 2</a> we will expect to see a more
                completed web site.</p>
            <h3>Viewing your webpage locally</h3>
            <p>While developing your webpage it is important to consistently check your changes.
                Follow these three simple steps to open your webpage locally in your web
                browser:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>open your browser</li>
                <li>on Windows: <code>control + o</code>
                    <br /> on Mac: <code>command + o</code>
                </li>
                <li>browse your local file explorer for your webpage</li>
            </ol>
        </section>
        <section title="how_to_submit">
            <h3>Submitting your work</h3>
            <p>You are required to save your HTML page(s) and CSS file in your <q>personal
                    webpage</q> Git repository AND move them to your personal web space accounts at
                newtFire.org using the FTP client that we showed you how to configure (see Courseweb for configuration instructions if you need to configure your FTP client). Be sure to
                    <em>add</em>, <em>commit</em>, and <em>push</em> your files from your local Git
                repository to your remote GitHub repository.</p>
            <p><em>A note on mindful file management:</em> We recommend you save your CSS stylesheet
                in the same directory with your HTML pages, because then you simply need to indicate
                the filename in the <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element that sits in the
                    <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element of each HTML page. The same applies for pages
                that are linked from other pages. Otherwise, you will need to declare the folder
                (directory) followed by a <code>/</code> and then the filename. Mindful file
                management is a key component of creating a well organized website.</p>
            <p>By convention, the first page you place in your website folder is designated your
                index.html page. You don’t have to have an index.html, but if you do, the main page
                of your site can be abbreviated to the name of the site directory holding the web
                files, like this one for Dr. Beshero-Bondar’s personal Pitt homepage:
                http://www.pitt.edu/~ebb8/ . By default, when given that address, the web browser
                retrieves the index.html file placed in her account’s space, and if it doesn’t find
                one it generates an error. (The site address leads to exactly the same place as
                http://www.pitt.edu/~ebb8/index.html .) By assigning any other name to your homepage
                someone visiting your site is required to call on that specific file/file path to
                get to your homepage. <strong>For this assignment please name your homepage
                        <code>index.html</code>.</strong></p>
            <p>Access your personal web space accounts at newtFire.org using your preferred file transfer program (FTP client). Move
                all of your developed HTML pages and your CSS file into the <code>public_html</code>
                folder. Be sure the file permissions on your main folder allow the group and others
                to <q>Read</q> and <q>Execute</q>. You (the owner) should be the only one able to
                write to this directory. The following image shows how to access file permissions
                and our recommended settings using WinSCP on a Windows machine; however, the setup
                should be similar on other platforms and in other file transfer programs.</p>
