            <h3>Preliminaries</h3>
            <p>First complete <a href="GitExercise1.html">Git Exercise 1</a>. It will benefit you to
                keep this <a href="explainGitShell.html" target="_blank">tutorial</a> open while you
                work on this assignment. Also, you should complete this assignment on a computer you
                will likely be using the most this semester, because you will be configuring it to
                get it working routinely with Git and GitHub and navigating your own file
                directories. (You can always set up Git on other computers when you need to and
                access GitHub wherever you are.)</p>

            <h3>Analysis of the task</h3>
            <p>The goals of this assignment are:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Clone and navigate locally our <a target="_blank"
                        href="https://github.com/ebeshero/DHClass-Hub">DHClass-Hub</a>
                    repository</li>
                <li>Create a personal remote repository on GitHub via website</li>
                <li>Make a local clone of your personal remote repository</li>
                <li>Add a file to a repository using Git and push it to your remote repository.</li>
                <li>Comment and/or create an Issue on GitHub.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Upon completion of this assignment you should feel confident about <dfn>pushing</dfn>
                and <dfn>pulling</dfn> files using Git and interacting on GitHub. Our courses
                require weekly, even daily, Git activity; therefore, if you still feel uncertain on
                how to use Git or GitHub after completing this assignment please meet with an
                instructor. We will gladly assist you so that you feel comfortable using Git and
                GitHub on a regular basis.</p>

        <section title="step_by_step">
            <h3>Step By Step</h3>
            <p> First navigate to our <a target="_blank"
                    href="https://github.com/ebeshero/DHClass-Hub">DHClass-Hub</a> repository and
                    <dfn>clone</dfn> the DHClass-Hub to your local computer. Follow our <a
                    href="explainGitShell.html#cloning" target="_blank">tutorial steps on
                    cloning</a>.</p>
            <p>Once you have the DHClass-Hub cloned navigate to the repo on your local computer.
                Search through the directory and find the folder called <q>sandbox</q>. The sandbox
                directory is a space for you to practice adding, committing, and pushing files to.
                Go ahead and add ANY file to the sandbox by dragging a file into that directory or
                saving a file from &lt;oXygen&gt; there. Notice others have added pictures, text
                files, and a variety of code files. You can open any of these files, but try not to
                delete any files you have not created yourself. You will only be able to push your new
                file if we haved added you as a collaborator (which should have been done with
                completion of <a href="GitExercise1.html">Git Exercise 1</a>).</p>
            <p>Use command line to <a href="explainGitShell.html#working" target="_blank">add,
                    commit, and push</a> your sandbox file to the DHClass-Hub.</p>
            <p>Next, we want you to create your own repository. Later in this course you will be
                creating a personal website; therefore, we are having you create a Git repo that
                will correlate with the development of said site. To create a new repo go to your
                GitHub profile, select the <q>Repositories</q> tab, and click <q>New</q>.</p>
            <p><img src="NewRepo_GitEx1.jpg" alt="GitHub Create Repo" /></p>
            <p>Give your repo a logical name (i.e. my_page), a brief description, and select
                    <q>public</q>. During this course we ask you to keep this repo public so we can
                view each otherâ€™s site development without everyone in the course having to be added
                as a collaborator; however, you can switch this to private in the future.</p>
            <p>Now that you have created the repo on GitHub you need to <dfn><a
                        href="explainGitShell.html#cloning" target="_blank">clone</a></dfn> it to
                your local computer (just like you cloned the DHClass-Hub above). After you have the
                repo cloned you can make some edits to your README.md file using markdown and/or add
                more files. Feel free to reference my <a
                    href="https://github.com/RJP43/personalWebpage" target="_blank">GitHub repo</a>
                used for the development of my <a href="http://newtfire.org/~rjp43/" target="_blank"
                    >personal website</a>.</p>
            <p>Your final task is to navigate on GitHub to your personal page repo, and follow our
                    <a href="explainGitShell.html#collaborators" target="_blank">tutorial steps to
                    add a collaborator</a>. Add your instructor(s) to your repo. After the
                completion of this course you can remove any unwanted collaborators; however, for
                this assignment we want you to practice adding at least one collaborator. Also when
                creating your own repo you may need to change the settings to include an issues
                board; follow these <a target="_blank"
                    href="https://help.github.com/articles/managing-projects-with-issues/"
                    >help.github.com directions</a> to do so if the <q>Issues</q> tab is not automatically there.</p>

            <p>Welcome to the Git community! You have successfully completed the basic tasks of
