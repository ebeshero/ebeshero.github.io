			<b><a href="http://www.pitt.edu/%7eebb8/DHDS/syllfa2013.html">Fall 2013 Digital Humanities Class at Pitt-Greensburg</a></b>
			
			<h2>Course Projects for Digital Humanities/Digital Studies</h2>
			<div align="center">
				<p><b>Due Dates:</b> Weekly reporting by each group to instuctors, Finals Week Deadline for Projects.</p></div>
			
			<p>This project involves the class as whole engaged generally in two kinds of activities:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Preparing new files to publish on “Digital Archives and Pacific
 Cultures”: 18th-century texts connected with Pacific cultural contact, 
and analysis of their content, and</li>
					<li>Writing consistent markup for indexing the whole archive, following and adapting our TEI system and coding guidelines.</li>
				</ol>
					
			<p>In small groups, each of you will be engaged in a range of 
research and coding activities which you’ll need to break into stages. 
Your work will involve document analysis, reading and researching about 
people, places, and events, as well as markup in XML, and transforming 
that markup to HTML (with SVG or KML), styled with CSS (and, as needed, 
some Javascript we’ll prepare to help with dynamic activities.)</p>
			<hr/>
			<p><b>Group 1:</b> Captain Cook’s First Voyage and Culture I:  3+ people: (Ashley Necciai, Tyler Roble, Natalie Skinner)</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Prepare a new TEI XML file of an important voyage narrative. 
Structural and content markup of Hawkesworth’s account of Cook’s first 
voyage (from a good, clean copy at <a href="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/tcp-ecco/">ECCO TCP</a>).
				<ul>
					<li>Structural markup: Put two files together: Hawkesworth <a href="http://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/ecco/004846500.0001.002?cite1=Hawkesworth;cite1restrict=author;cite2=Voyages;cite2restrict=title;rgn=full+text;view=toc;q1=Southern+Hemisphere">“Part 2”</a> and <a href="http://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/ecco/004846500.0001.003?cite1=Hawkesworth;cite1restrict=author;cite2=Voyages;cite2restrict=title;rgn=full+text;view=toc;q1=Southern+Hemisphere">“Part 3”</a> (both are of Cook’s first voyage).</li>
					<li>Content markup of significant passages on Tahiti and/or other 
Pacific cultures: Book I, chs. VII – XX, Book II, chs. I – X? (Choose 
passages to focus on) Autotag proper names, dates, places, geo.</li>
				</ul>
				
				</li>
				<li>Work on site indexing, prosopography development (see below)</li>
				<li>Transforms for web: a) reading views, b) interesting info to graph/ chart.</li>
			</ol>
		<hr/>
			<p><b>Group 2:</b> Cook’s 2nd Voyage and Culture II: 3+ people: (Emily Stark, Sara Fortini, Kathryn Baker, Mayi Himayapsill)</p>	
			<ol>
				<li>Content markup our TEI XML file of Cook’s second voyage: Autotag proper names, dates, places.</li>
				<li>Select new material, or passages from texts to transcribe and 
code. Some of these are marked in ECCO TCP—and won’t require new 
transcription. </li>
				<li>Recommended texts: One is a play called <a href="http://www.pitt.edu/%7Eebb8/DHDS/Omai.html"><i>Omai, or a Trip Around the World</i></a>
 that we began coding last year, and can continue with content markup. 
This semester’s ECCO location turned up another interesting epilogue to a
 play in the voice of Queen Oberea, scorning English culture.</li>
				<li>Transforms for web: a) reading views, b) interesting info to graph/ chart.</li>
				<li>Prosopography Development (see below).</li>
			</ol>
			<hr/>
			<p><b>Group 3:</b> The Forster Files and KML mapping to Google Earth /
 Google Maps: 3+ people: (Greg Gismondi, Ki Cardonick, Joe Renfro, Alec 
Bartman)</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Content markup of our TEI XML of Johann Forster's and Georg 
Forster’s voyage narratives: Autotag proper names, dates, places, geo. </li>
				<li>KML coding and mapping of Georg Forster's voyage account (Johann Forster does not have day-by-day coordinates)</li>
				<li>Expansion of KML coding of Cook’s second voyage.</li>
				<li><b>Coordinating with Group 1’s markup</b>, do KML mapping of Cook’s first voyage.</li>
				<li>Experiment with Google Earth and/or other mapping software, 
connecting to text markup: Can we connect time and place? Can we 
position map views in alternate ways on the site? </li>
				<li>Prosopography Development (see below).</li>
			</ol>
			<hr/>
			<p><b>Group 4:</b> ECCO Bibliography, Notes, and Scrapbook of English
 Pacific References: 3+ people: (Michelle Dempsey, Carrie Hood, Brittany
 Williams)</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Prepare a single official bibliography of relevant material 
we’ve found through “ECCOlocation” this semester, for HTML publication. </li>
				<li>Add content markup to our notes (people, places, dates, cultural info)</li>
				<li>Prepare a new TEI XML file or files: an assembly (in one file or
 multiple files) of interesting  short “snippets” from a selection of 
ECCO / ECCO TCP texts <b>not directly about the Pacific, but featuring Tahitian / Pacific cultural references</b>. Apply structure and content markup. </li>
				<li>Transforms for web: a) reading views, b) interesting info to graph/ chart.</li>
				<li>Prosopography Development (see below).</li>
			</ol>
			<hr/>
			
			<p><b>Prosopography Development:</b> Go to <a href="https://pitt.box.com/s/pbfdhdv0ukdwrwrew6of">our Prosopography Folder in Box</a> for model lists 
				and detailed instructions on how to prepare this from your persName and placeName tagging.</p>
			<p>All Groups will need to run 
queries on our archive to keep track of and develop lists of people, 
places, and dates in use in the archive. We’ll need to start with this, 
and as we proceed, we’d like each group to identify and research 
specific people and events, and to write brief descriptions to help 
build a central “prosopography” file. <b>Prosopography</b> is the study 
of how people are connected by events, and in building an archive we 
effectively collect lots of prosopography data: In coding TEI archives, 
we refer to building “personographies,” “placeographies,” as well as 
bibliographies and lists of events, etc. We need to work on this aspect 
of our project—and it involves the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Establishing a searchable list of each distinct person (place, event) that matters in our archive</li>
				<li>Defining the best spelling of proper names—and referring all 
variations on that name back to a central standard. We’ll work out a 
system for doing this, which involves defining a distinct <span class="code">@xml:id</span> in our prosopography list for each distinct person and event. Then we can go back and use that id value in <span class="code">@ref</span> attributes throughout the site to make connections, build links, and make it possible to find that person. </li>
				<li>We’re at the beginning stage of this process, so your work is 
groundbreaking here! By the end of our course, we hope to prepare a 
partial prosopography file for web viewing, and begin linking it to your
 coding of specific texts. </li>
				<li>This work is ultimately connected with a Site Overhaul of 
“Digital Archives and Pacific Cultures”! (Instructors will work on this,
 with input from groups: As we prepare new material to add, we’ll need 
to reformat the site (change our CSS etc.) to better connect our files 
and to accommodate a new system of searching.) </li>
			</ul>
