            <h3>Preliminaries</h3>
            <p>Before beginning this assignment, please thoroughly read <a
                    href="http://newtfire.org/dh/explainSchematron.html">our introduction to
                    Schematron</a>. This tutorial will be useful to you during this assignment and
                the <a href="http://newtfire.org/dh/SchematronExercise2.html">Schematron Exercise
                    2</a>. To begin this assignment, you will need to open a new Schematron document
                in &lt;oXygen/&gt; under <strong>File &#8594; New &#8594; New Document &#8594;
                    (scroll to Schematron in the alphabetized list) &#8594; Schematron</strong>.
                Once opened, you will keep the default xml line at the top, but you will delete
                everything from <code>&lt;sch:schema&gt;</code> down. You will then replace this
                with:</p>
            <pre>&lt;schema xmlns:sch="http://purl.oclc.org/dsdl/schematron" queryBinding="xslt2"
    xmlns:sqf="http://www.schematron-quickfix.com/validator/process"
    xmlns="http://purl.oclc.org/dsdl/schematron"&gt;
       
        
        &lt;/schema&gt;</pre>
            <p><span class="smaller">You will be writing your Schematron <strong>inside</strong> the
                        <code>&lt;schema&gt;</code> root element.</span></p>

            <section title="background">
                <h4>Background:</h4>
                <p>For this assignment, we are looking at votes for what place the Pitt-Greensburg
                    DH Class will go for Spring Break. The options include: New York City, Mexico,
                    London, and Rome. Each place gets between 0% to 100% of the votes. Assume here
                    that this is the final voting poll, and there are no other options. This means
                    that when you add the four percentages together, the result must be exactly
                    100%. Also assume that this is recording the already calculated percentage of
                    the votes, not the raw count of the votes. All of these percentages are to be
                    integer values.</p>
                <p>Here is a Relax NG schema for the results of the Spring Break votes:</p>
                <pre>start = results
results = element results {place+}
place = element place {name, xsd:int}
name = attribute name {"NYC" | "Mexico" | "London" | "Rome"}</pre>
                <p>Here is a sample XML document that is valid against the above schema:</p>
                <pre>&lt;results&gt;
    &lt;place name="NYC"&gt;34&lt;/place&gt;
    &lt;place name="Mexico"&gt;24&lt;/place&gt;    
    &lt;place name="Rome"&gt;30&lt;/place&gt;
    &lt;place name="London"&gt;12&lt;/place&gt;
&lt;/results&gt;</pre>
                <p>Our Relax NG schema is a little sloppy and doesn’t constrain the XML as
                    thoroughly as it could have been better written (as we will discuss below). It
                    lets us set a rule that the content of the element <code>&lt;place&gt;</code>
                    must be a number (or xsd:int for integer), but the rule isn’t really good enough
                    as we will see from the from the following example:</p>
                <div class="badCode">&lt;results&gt;<br/>
                    <span class="indent">&lt;place name="NYC"&gt;27&lt;/place&gt;</span><br />
                    <span class="indent">&lt;place name="Mexico"&gt;39&lt;/place&gt;</span><br />
                    <span class="indent">&lt;place name="Rome"&gt;12&lt;/place&gt;</span><br />
                    <span class="indent">&lt;place name="London"&gt;15&lt;/place&gt;</span><br />
                    &lt;/results&gt;</div>
                <p>Do you see the problem? The four percentage values only total 93%! No matter how
                    good our coding is, it is not possible to keep this type of error from happening
                    by using Relax NG alone. That is why we use Schematron.</p>
            </section>
            <section title="task">
                <h4>Task:</h4>
                <p>First, re-create the Relax NG schema file and the XML document by copying and
                    pasting the <strong>blue sample code above</strong> into files with the
                    appropriate file extensions. Associate your newly created Schematron and the
                    Relax NG schema with your XML. As you write the following rules, "munge" (aka
                    mess up) the XML to verify your rules are firing by entering correct and
                    incorrect values into the XML.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Write a Schematron rule that verifies the four percentages always equal
                        100%.</li>

                    <li>Write a Schematron rule that fires an error when any location’s voting
                        percentage sits outside of the 0 to 100 range. There should be no negative
                        integers and no integers greater than 100. <span class="smaller">(Hint: the
                            Relax NG schema states that these values must be integers, so you will
                            not have to worry about making sure of that; however, the computer
                            parser will not recognize the values in each <code>&lt;place&gt;</code>
                            as integers and instead will try to process them as strings of text. Use
                            the <code>number()</code> function so the computer parses the values as
                            numbers.)</span></li>
                    <!--2017-02-22 ebb: We notice that we need the number() function when the content of an element is a number like this, but we DON'T need it when the  number is pulled from an attribute. We should investigate this further.  -->

                    <li>Write a Schematron rule that tests there are only ever four place elements in our list of locations to visit for Spring Break.</li>

                    <li>Write a Schematron rule that tests if any of the <code>@name</code> values
                        are repeated. It should not be possible for there to be any places that
                        appear more than once in the XML. <span class="smaller">(Hint: Think about using the <code>count()</code> function for this. How many different values for <code>@name</code> should there be? How would you make sure each value is not repeated?</span></li>
                </ol>
                <h4>Optional Task:</h4>

                    <p>Write a Schematron rule that tests whether the places are listed in
                        order from greatest to least number of votes. <span class="smaller">(Hint: You will need to
                            check the <strong>numerical</strong> value of each place with their
                                <strong>sibling</strong> place’s <strong>numerical</strong>
                            value. Depending on your rule context you may need to clarify the position of the immediate sibling using the [1] position notation.)</span></p>
