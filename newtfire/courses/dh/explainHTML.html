      <h3>Introduction: HTML in Context</h3>
      <p>In our course, at the point we expect you’ll be reading this, you have been writing and
         planning XML documents. By now you’re accustomed to writing well-formed XML code, as well
         as writing rules to constrain what elements, attributes, and content you want an XML file
         to contain. So far, your writing of code has followed <strong>syntax</strong> rules for
         well-formedness, leaving the naming and content of your elements and attributes up to you,
            <a href="explainRNG.html">to control with your own schema rules</a>. We now turn to
         orient you to <strong>HTML</strong> (or <strong>H</strong>yper <strong>T</strong>ext
            <strong>M</strong>arkup <strong>L</strong>anguage), which has its origins in the concept
         of “hypertexts” as <strong>linkable</strong> (or “hyperlinked”) documents, and developed
         into markup controlling the presentation of pages to be networked and shared on the World
         Wide Web (W3). </p>
      <p>In writing HTML, we work within a standardized set of element and attribute names designed
         to be read by web browsers. XHTML (and the other forms of HTML that we’ll tell you about)
         all rely on standards formulated by the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/">World Wide
            Web Consortium</a> (abbreviated <strong>W3C</strong>), an organization founded in 1994
         to develop open-source, platform-independent schema for coding and best practices around
         the world for sharing and displaying in web browsers. A web browser is software designed to
         share and display documents and other resources on the World Wide Web accessed through the
         internet. A web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, Safari) is considered “standards-compliant”
         when it supports the coding approved by the W3C for the creation of web pages, their
         styling, their linking to other sites, their representation of metadata, and their dynamic
         features to be customized by site visitors. Those curious to read about the history of HTML
         and the origins of the World Wide Web (and the much earlier origins of the Internet) can
         read more at <a href="http://www.livinginternet.com/">LivingInternet.com</a> (a wonderfully
         extensive resource), or this concise and witty walk through: <a
            href="http://www.rackspace.com/blog/internet-history-html-evolution/">“Internet History:
            HTML Code Evolution 1.0 to 5.0.”</a></p>
      <p>This guide orients you to <strong>XHTML</strong> (or e<strong>X</strong>tensible
            <strong>H</strong>yper <strong>T</strong>ext <strong>M</strong>arkup
         <strong>L</strong>anguage), which at the time of this writing is the most strictly defined
         content model for hypertexts. XHTML requires XML syntax using the hierarchical, nested
         elements and the start and end tags that you are familiar with from writing XML. XHTML is
         the form of HTML used by the W3C on their site pages, and it has served as the long-term
         recommendation for precise code designed to be <strong>interoperable</strong> with other
         XML data formats, such as SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics—which you’ll later be learning to
         draw and code). <strong>Interoperability</strong> is term referring to a technology’s
         capacity to communicate effectively with a different kind of technology. HTML and the World
         Wide Web were first developed in the early 1990s in an attempt to make various information
         retrieval structures speak to each other in an interoperable way, and XHTML, due to its
         strict syntax control, effectively maximizes the interoperability of HTML, which is
         especially important for those of us developing XML-based projects with a public face on
         the World Wide Web. </p>
      <h3>Basic Requirements of XHTML</h3>
      <p><strong>Valid XHTML syntax</strong> requires the following basic structure, beginning
         with a <span class="code">&lt;!DOCTYPE&gt;</span> declaration: </p>
      <div class="code"> &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;<br /> &lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;<br />
         <span class="indent">&lt;head&gt;</span><br />
         <span class="indentMore">&lt;title&gt;A Title Here&lt;/title&gt;</span><br />
         <span class="indent">&lt;/head&gt;</span><br />
         <span class="indent">&lt;body&gt;<br /></span>
         <span class="indent">&lt;/body&gt;</span><br /> &lt;/html&gt;<br />
      </div>
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> We will make some modifications to this in the next section to adapt
         it to newtFire’s server environment.</p>
      <p>The <span class="code">&lt;!DOCTYPE&gt;</span> and namespace declarations tell the web
         browser what version of HTML you’re working with. &lt;oXygen/&gt; inserts this declaration
         for us when we choose it from the “Framework Template” list: To open a new (X)HTML file with
         the current doctype and namespace declarations in &lt;oXygen/&gt;, open a new file (under <strong>File
            → New ), and enter HTML in the search bar. This will open an HTML document that follows our XHTML syntax rules.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>You’ll recognize our root element, which is always <span class="code">&lt;html&gt;</span>
         and must always indicate an XML name space as an attribute: the <span class="code"
            >xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"</span> part. Literally, this points from your root
         &lt;html&gt; element to the published standards set by the W3 consortium for XHTML. <span
            class="smaller">Note: &lt;oXygen/&gt; comes with up-to-date W3 schemas to validate that
            the code you’re writing is good, strict XHTML, but if you weren’t working in
            &lt;oXygen/&gt;, or if you’re just curious about whether a site you find on the web is
            valid, you can always use the <a href="http://validator.w3.org/">W3C Markup Validation
               Service</a>.</span>
      </p>
      <p>The <span class="code">head</span> element is always required and must contain a <span
            class="code">title</span> element, but note that this does not display on the browser
         page (though it often appears in the tabs above the browser window). <strong>The part of
            your web page that displays in the browser is coded within the <span class="code"
               >body</span> element.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>You really don’t need many elements to build a website, so we are introducing a simple
         selection that we find ourselves always using in our pages (including the course pages
         you’re reading). For more, we recommend the <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/"
            >w3schools site</a> as a useful ready reference to look up HTML elements, see how they
         display in browsers, as well as how to style them using <a
            href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp">Cascading Stylesheets (CSS)</a> code
         which we’ll be covering, too, in our <a href="explainCSS.html">Introduction to CSS</a>. </p>
      <p>To get a view of how most of the elements we’re discussing fit together on a web page, try
         selecting “View Page Source” (by right-clicking in your browser window, or locating it in
         your browser menu options.

      <h3>How to Save Your Work for Your Server Environment (with newtFire Protocols)</h3>
      <p>Note that different server environments have different protocols and ways of handling XHTML
         Doctype declaration and file extensions, so you want to find out the specific protocols for
         file extensions and posting files from your network administrator. You may save HTML files
         with either of the following extensions: <code>.xhtml</code> or <code>.html</code>. On the NewtFire server we tend to prefer the more commonly used <code>.html</code> extension, and we also add code to ensure that UTF-8 characters are always served in every
         browser, and to help make the HTML page fully responsive on a wide range of screens (from mobile devices to wide-screen monitors). <strong>If you are developing a newtFire project,</strong> then we recommend that you
         save your work as <code>.html</code> and apply the following setup for your <code>Doctype
            declaration</code> and <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element:</p>
      <pre> &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; 
         &lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;
            &lt;head&gt; 
               &lt;title&gt;Your page title here &lt;!--to appear in the browser tab, but not on the page--&gt; &lt;/title&gt;
               <span class="code">&lt;meta charset="UTF-8" /&gt; 
               &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" /&gt;</span>
               &lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="explain.css"/&gt;  
           &lt;/head&gt; 
           &lt;body&gt; &lt;!--Code the viewable part of your site here.--&gt;
           &lt;/body&gt;
         &lt;/html&gt;  
      </pre>
      <h3>Block-Level Body Elements</h3>
      <p><strong>Block-level</strong> elements are the major structural components of an XHTML page,
         and usually we do not nest these inside each other: They are discrete “blocks” formatted
         for distinct display on a page. Each of these elements opens on its own line and closes
         before the next block-level element opens. Block-level elements are the only permitted
         children of the HTML root element, and they include headings, paragraphs, lists, and
         tables. </p>
      <h4>Headings</h4>
      <p>Heading elements are for title and section headings throughout your page. HTML defines six
         levels of headings, with the idea that the first level is usually the largest and
         strongest, and others get smaller and smaller. The heading tags are: <span class="code"
            >&lt;h1&gt;</span>, <span class="code">&lt;h2&gt;</span>, <span class="code"
            >&lt;h3&gt;</span>, <span class="code">&lt;h4&gt;</span>, <span class="code"
            >&lt;h5&gt;</span>, and <span class="code">&lt;h6&gt;</span>. The idea is to use these
         in order, so that you typically only use <span class="code">&lt;h1&gt;</span> once to give
         the title of the whole page, and then use <span class="code">&lt;h2&gt;</span> for major
         sections and <span class="code">&lt;h3&gt;</span> for subsections (etc.) Have a look at <a
            href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_headings">this visual
            example from w3schools</a> to see how these six elements typically display in a browser. </p>
      <h4>Paragraphs</h4>
      <p>Body paragraphs are simply coded with <span class="code">&lt;p&gt;</span> elements. See <a
            href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_paragraphs1">w3schools
            visual example</a> of code and browser display. </p>
      <h4>Lists</h4>
      <p>Lists are made with two elements, one nested inside the other: A list needs a “wrapper” (or
         container) element that indicates it’s a list and what kind of list (and that’s the block
         level part): The wrapper element is either &lt;ol&gt; for an “ordered” (or numbered) list,
         or &lt;ul&gt; for an “unordered” or bulleted list. (Whether your list is numbered or
         bulleted depends entirely on the wrapper element.) Inside that single wrapper we have
         multiple “items” coded with <span class="code">&lt;li&gt;</span> elements (for “list
         item”). Here’s a sample of coding for an unordered list, followed by an example of its
         visual display in the browser: </p>
      <div class="code"> &lt;ul&gt;<br />
         <span class="indent">&lt;li&gt;apples&lt;/li&gt;<br /></span>
         <span class="indent">&lt;li&gt;oranges&lt;/li&gt;<br /></span>
         <span class="indent">&lt;li&gt;bananas&lt;/li&gt;<br /></span> &lt;/ul&gt; </div>
      <p>Here’s the browser display of the coding above:</p>
      <ul>

         <li>apples</li>

         <li>oranges</li>

         <li>bananas</li>

      </ul>
      <p>If I change my wrapper element from &lt;ul&gt; to &lt;ol&gt;, I generate an ordered
         (numbered) list: </p>
      <ol>

         <li>apples</li>

         <li>oranges</li>

         <li>bananas</li>

      </ol>
      <p>(You’re probably noticing how much extra spacing I have in my unordered list: That’s
         because I have styled my unordered lists with CSS code to be “padded” with extra spaces on
         my course pages. Here’s <a
            href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_lists_unordered">a visual
            example from w3schools</a> so you can see a default (unstyled) browser view. Try editing
         the code on the w3schools page to turn the unordered list into an ordered list! </p>
      <h4>Tables</h4>
      <p>Tables are a little more complicated: These are made with three nested elements:</p>
      <ol>

         <li><span class="code">&lt;table&gt;</span>: This is the “wrapper” block-level element on
            the outside that defines the table. We can place an attribute called "border" on table
            to outline it and each of its internal cells: <span class="code">&lt;table
               border="1"&gt;</span>
         </li>

         <li><span class="code">&lt;tr&gt;</span>: Table row elements which define each horizontal
            row of a table. </li>

         <li><span class="code">&lt;td&gt;</span> or <span class="code">&lt;th&gt;</span>: Inside
            each table row are individual table cells (called “td” for “table data”). You can
            designate “heading” cells, which is styled with a little more emphasis, using <span
               class="code">&lt;th&gt;</span> (or “table header” cell). </li>

      </ol>
      <p>This may seem odd, but there isn’t an element for wrapping columns in a table. Instead,
         columns are created by stacking the individual <span class="code">td</span> cells inside
         their <span class="code">tr</span> rows. If a table row has five cells inside, you have a
         table with five columns. </p>
      <p>Here is a sample of code for an HTML table, outlined with a border, and containing three
         rows and three columns. In the first row, we’ve designated the table cells to be ( <span
            class="code">th</span> ) for headings, followed by a couple of rows containing ordinary
            <span class="code">td</span> cells. </p>
      <div class="code"> &lt;table border="1"&gt;<br />
         <span class="indent">&lt;tr&gt;</span><br />
         <span class="indentMore">&lt;th&gt;Row 1, left column (heading cell)&lt;/th&gt;</span><br />
         <span class="indentMore">&lt;th&gt;Row 1, middle column (heading cell)&lt;/th&gt;</span><br />
         <span class="indentMore">&lt;th&gt;Row 1, right column (heading cell)&lt;/th&gt;</span><br />
         <span class="indent">&lt;/tr&gt;</span><br />
         <span class="indent">&lt;tr&gt;</span><br />
         <span class="indentMore">&lt;td&gt;Row 2, left column&lt;/td&gt;</span><br />
         <span class="indentMore">&lt;td&gt;Row 2, left column&lt;/td&gt;</span><br />
         <span class="indentMore">&lt;td&gt;Row 2, left column&lt;/td&gt;</span><br />
         <span class="indent">&lt;/tr&gt;</span><br />
         <span class="indent">&lt;tr&gt;</span><br />
         <span class="indentMore">&lt;td&gt;Row 3, left column&lt;/td&gt;</span><br />
         <span class="indentMore">&lt;td&gt;Row 3, left column&lt;/td&gt;</span><br />
         <span class="indentMore">&lt;td&gt;Row 3, left column&lt;/td&gt;</span><br />
         <span class="indent">&lt;/tr&gt;</span><br /> &lt;/table&gt; </div>
      <p>Here’s a visual display of the table coding above:</p>
      <table>

         <tr>

            <th>Row 1, left column (heading cell)</th>

            <th>Row 1, middle column (heading cell)</th>

            <th>Row 1, right column (heading cell)</th>

         </tr>

         <tr>

            <td>Row 2, left column</td>

            <td>Row 2, left column</td>

            <td>Row 2, left column</td>

         </tr>

         <tr>

            <td>Row 3, left column</td>

            <td>Row 3, left column</td>

            <td>Row 3, left column</td>

         </tr>


      </table>
      <p>For more examples of tables including styling you might want to try applying to their
         borders, see <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asp">w3schools’ assortment
            of tables</a>. </p>
      <h3>In-line Body Elements</h3>
      <p>In-line elements are used inside the block-level elements, to set apart certain passages
         with emphasis, or to link out to other pages, or display an image or render a multimedia
         file in the browser. We use the following in-line elements most frequently in our work: </p>
      <ul>

         <li><strong>Bolding:</strong> Two choices: <span class="code">&lt;b&gt;</span> or <span
               class="code">&lt;strong&gt;</span>. One of these simply indicates bold, while the
            other is an example of a <strong>semantic</strong> element, which we like to use when we
            want to convey emphasis. </li>

         <li><b><em>Italics:</em></b> Again, two choices (with similar significance): <span
               class="code">&lt;i&gt;</span> or <span class="code">&lt;em&gt;</span>. The semantic
            element here is <span class="code">&lt;em&gt;</span>, again to indicate real
               <em>emphasis</em>. We use the <span class="code">&lt;i&gt;</span> element for titles
            of books, movies, etc, where we would typically italicize a title, as in Mary Shelley’s
            novel, <i>Frankenstein</i>. The output is really the same, but the underlying code can
            carry some meaning behind the presentational display. </li>

         <li><b>Links:</b> Use the “anchor” element <span class="code">&lt;a&gt;</span> to wrap text
            to make a clickable link, and define the target of the link with the <span class="code"
               >@href</span> attribute, like this (code view followed by browser display):<br /><br />
            <div class="code"> &lt;p&gt;Here’s some text inside a paragraph with a &lt;a
               href="http://www.pitt.edu/~ebb8/DHDS/"&gt;clickable link to our course
               homepage&lt;/a&gt;. And then some more text.&lt;/p&gt; </div>
            <p>Here’s some text inside a paragraph with a <a href="http://www.pitt.edu/~ebb8/DHDS/"
                  >clickable link to our course homepage</a>. And then some more text. </p>
         </li>

         <li><b>Images:</b>
            <span class="code">&lt;img/&gt;</span> with its required <span class="code">@src</span>
            and <span class="code">@alt</span> attributes. Image elements are distinct from other
            in-line elements because they are <strong>empty</strong> (or self-closing) elements:
            they contain only attribute content, not textual content. <div class="code"> &lt;img
               src="sandbox.jpg" alt="image of a sandbox"/&gt; </div>
            <p>To make an image display in your web page is a little like coding a link: You have to
               point to a target using the <span class="code">@src</span> attribute and set its
               value to indicate a separate image file, and you have to set the <span class="code"
                  >@alt</span> attribute to some text that serves as a stand-in for the image, a W3C
               requirement in case the image does not display in the browser, as for example in
               braille browsers or browsers with text to speech recognition for the visually
               impaired. The image file might be sitting in the same local directory with your web
               page, as in the example above. Or we can point to an image at some other file or
               address on the World Wide Web, like this: </p>
            <div class="code"> &lt;img src="wolf_and_eagle.jpg" alt="Leonardo Da Vinci’s drawing of
               the Allegory of the Wolf and the Eagle"/&gt; </div>
            <p>Sources like Wikimedia Commons provide public domain images with information on their

      <h3>Generic Block and Inline Body Elements: (div and span)</h3>
      <p>You should know about two more extremely versatile HTML elements. These are used to block
         off portions of your document to format in a precise way, such as to create boxes sitting
         side by side on your page (as we did above to set a text next to an image). These are
         extremely useful for styling with CSS, as <a href="explainCSS.html">you’ll be learning
            shortly</a>. Here are the generic elements that we frequently use: </p>
      <ul>

         <li><span class="code">&lt;div&gt;</span>: The div element lets you wrap a portion of your
            page in a block-level division, perhaps to style in a particular way or locate in a
            particular space on your page. We’ve used <span class="code">div</span> elements all
            over this page to organize it visually. We typically use an <span class="code"
               >@class</span> attribute to designate particular kinds of divs, to designate divs
            that hold images, or divs that hold blocks of display code, for example. Example: <span
               class="code">&lt;div class="inner-box"&gt;</span>
         </li>

         <li><span class="code">&lt;span&gt;</span>: The span element is our in-line generic element
            for grabbing and highlighting significant spans of text that we want to stand out,
            perhaps with color coding. We’ve used the <span class="code">&lt;span&gt;</span> element
            on this page and on our other guide pages to highlight the code snippets we show you
            in-line, and again we typically use an <span class="code">@class</span> attribute to
            classify different kinds of spans. Example: <span class="code">&lt;span
               class="code-snippet"&gt;</span></li>

      </ul>
      <h3>Editing and Uploading Your XHTML Pages: Working with Server Space</h3>
      <p>You can edit XHTML pages and save them, together with their associated image and stylesheet
         (and other) files, in a directory all together to be viewed in a web browser. That
         directory could be on your own personal computer (and while you are first developing pages
         you might simply save files on your local computer even disconnected from the internet to
         view in a web browser while you’re drafting, though of course any content you have linked
         to on remote locations on the World Wide Web will not load if you are not online).
         Typically we create web pages to have a public-facing presence on the World Wide Web, or at
         least to have a community presence on an intranet (shared within a firewall while a site is
         under development). To make our pages available to others to access requires uploading them
         to a web server using <strong>F</strong>ile <strong>T</strong>ransfer
         <strong>P</strong>rotocol (FTP), a standard rule system for exchanging files between
         computers over a network. Various security measures have been developed to guard web
         servers from invasive hacking attacks, so that many web servers require
         <strong>S</strong>ecure <strong>F</strong>ile <strong>T</strong>ransfer
         <strong>P</strong>rotocol (SFTP) and nearly always require registration and authentication
         with a username and password. SFTP can be accessed <a
            href="http://www.computerhope.com/jargon/c/commandi.htm">from command line</a>, though
         more frequently people tend to use one of several freely available SFTP software clients
         with a GUI (Graphical User Interface) that stores your site connection information and, on
         connection, shows the files in your computer and the files on the remote server, making it
         easy to upload and download. (We’ve posted information on <a href="CDASyll.html">a few good
            SFTP clients </a>on our course syllabus.) When HTML pages are uploaded on a web server,
         they are given a specific <strong>URL</strong>, or <strong>U</strong>niform
            <strong>R</strong>esource <strong>L</strong>ocator, otherwise known as a website
         address, and it usually begins with <strong>http://</strong> followed by a a distinct
         locator for the web browser and your directories and files on it, as in
            <strong>http://newtfire.org/dh/CDASyll.html</strong>. </p>
      <p>By convention, the first page you place in a particular website folder is designated your
            <strong>index.html</strong> page. You don’t have to have an index.html, but if you do,
         the main page of your site can be abbreviated to the name of the site directory holding the
         web files, like this one for my personal Pitt homepage: <strong><a
            href="http://www.pitt.edu/~ebb8/">http://www.pitt.edu/~ebb8/</a></strong>, or these from our newtFire server for <a href="http://newtfire.org/~jmh237/">Jon Horanic</a>, <a href="http://newtfire.org/~set37/">Stacey Triplette</a>, <a href="http://newtfire.org/~bstewart/">Brooke Stewart</a>, and <a href="http://newtfire.org/~rjp43/">Becca Parker</a>. By
         default, when given that address, the web browser retrieves the index.html file I have
         placed in that space, and if it doesn’t find one it generates an error. (The site address
         leads to exactly the same place as <strong>http://www.pitt.edu/~ebb8/index.html</strong> .) </p>
      <p>If you are a student enrolled in our course at Pitt-Greensburg, we have shown you (or are
         about to show you) how to access our class’s newtfire web server together with <a
            href="https://courseweb.pitt.edu">SFTP (instructions posted on Courseweb
            Announcements)</a> so that you can access your personal folder to upload files through
         an SFTP client and then view those files in a web browser. As with most colleges and
         universities, students, faculty, and staff across the Pitt system have access to
         public-facing personal web space, which we encourage you to learn about and set up on your
         space following <a href="http://technology.pitt.edu/support/creating-your-own-web-site"
            >Pitt’s posted instructions</a>. Enrolled students in our course will post files to <a
            href="http://newtfire.org/">our newtFire server</a> for HTML related homework exercises and for
         course project website development, and we provide information to you privately on how to access your assigned web space.</p>
      <h3>Setting up XSLT to Make HTML</h3>
      <p>When you learn to write XSLT to transform XML into HTML, you will need to configure some settings and create a template rule that matches on the document node. The stylesheet should start out something like this:</p>
      <pre>
         &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
         &lt;xsl:stylesheet <span class="code">xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"</span>
         xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform" version="2.0"&gt;
         &lt;xsl:output <span class="code">method="xhtml" encoding="utf-8" doctype-system="about:legacy-compat" omit-xml-declaration="yes"</span> /&gt;
         &lt;xsl:template match="/"&gt;
         &lt;html&gt;
         &lt;head&gt;
         &lt;title&gt;&lt;!-- title will go here --&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
         &lt;meta charset="UTF-8" /&gt;<br /> 
         &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" /&gt;
         &lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="whatever.css"/&gt;<br />
         &lt;/head&gt;
         &lt;body&gt;
         &lt;!-- you'll normally use one or more &lt;xsl:apply-templates&gt; rules here --&gt;
         &lt;/body&gt;
         &lt;/html&gt;
         &lt;/xsl:template&gt;
         &lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt;
      </pre>
      <p>Basically, we map out the <q>skeleton</q> of the HTML file, all its basic structural components within a first  template rule matching on the document node. One oddity is the <code>@doctype-system</code> attribute: We have to set this to "about:legacy-compat" because XSLT otherwise will not generate the HTML DOCTYPE line that it needs to be valid. The output HTML document will have a longer doctype line (<code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html SYSTEM "about:legacy-compat"&gt;</code> instead of just <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code>), but it basically indicates the same thing to a web browser.
         <span class="smaller">XSLT can only output the longer form of the doctype line, based on the way it parses code. The indication of <q>legacy</q> compatibility basically indicates that the XSLT technology producing the HTML is a legacy system, maintaining compatibility with current HTML standards.</span></p>
