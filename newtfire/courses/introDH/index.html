               <strong>Fall 2020:</strong>
               Classes meet M W F 3:35 - 4:25pm over Zoom and in Kochel 77. Zoom attendance is required for all students. The classroom is optional, but even in the classroom you will be connecting to Zoom to team up with your classmates.
               We may need to divide into groups to rotate attendance in the physical classroom. Group assignments will be made in <a href="http://canvas.psu.edu">Canvas</a>.
               For in-class meetings, we must all wear masks and maintain a safe social distance. Remember: <em>Your mask protects me, my mask protects you</em>.

            <h2>Introduction to Digital Humanities: Course Description</h2>
            
            <p>This course is designed to provide students an immersive introductory experience of digital humanities, as an area of serious investigation, reflection, and creative play. Digital activities are central to everything we do in this course. We will explore how digital tools can change how we read and mediate what we see of the world.  We will consider how controversies that deeply divide our society have a bearing on the devices append to ourselves, as well as allow us to shape new experiences of community. We have never been so aware of technology and its limits in testing our experience of shcool classrooms, and yet we may become aware of ourselves as present virtually in a ways that are fascinatingly distinct from our so-called "real" lives. Our course will give us scope to explore serious issues like compromised data and racial disparities cultivated by supposedly color-blind technology. We will also explore engaging creative immersive realities by artist-designers on the public web. We will, finally, explore what a free public web might mean in our time, and what shaping powers we might have in an age of bots and ads. </p>

            <h2>Grading:</h2>
            
    
           <h3>Digital Readings, Online Discussions and Online Annotation Assignments (20%)</h3>
            <p>Throughout the course,  we will be working on actively responding to readings using online annotation. Annotations will lead us to curate a collection of related materials and contexts we find relevant to digital humanities. 
            Hypothes.is annotations can themselves be searched, filtered, and processed digitally. We will use hypothes.is as a connection between traditional reading (with a highlighter or pen) and digital enhancement.
            Annotations will be evaluated for clarity, accuracy, and and thoroughness in responding to the assignment. </p>
            
            
            <h3>Website Development and Critique (20%)</h3>
            <p>You will be experimenting with developing a website in two different formats, one using GitHub, widely used by coders and developers, and the other a more conventional developing medium. This will involve developing content, based on your choice of digital humanities topics we explore in the course, as well as critique of the mode of designing a web resource.  This also represents a significant introductory foray in coding and development, familiarizing yourself with digital systems of media pubilication.</p>
            
            <h3>Digital Visualization and Reflection Assignments (20%)</h3> 
            <p>This grouping of assignments involves processing data to produce visualizations that we explore in this class. Each of these will be accompanied by written reflection of the strengths and limits of the visualization.</p>
            <h3>Game Analysis (20%)</h3><p>You will play an "indie" game based on a selection I will provide the class from itch.io, and write a detailed critique </p>
            <h3>Midterm Take-Home Exam (10%) and Final Take-Home Exam (10%)</h3> <p>Exams will involve review of key terms and concepts in digital humanities that we encounter throughout the course, as well as reflective synthesis of the course experiences and material. </p>
   
            
  
            
            <h3>Grading Scale:</h3>
            
            <p>Grades for the course are calcuated and posted on Canvas, and follow this standard
               scale: A: 93-100%, A-:
               90-92%, B+: 87-89%, B: 83-86%, B-: 80-82%, C+: 77-79%, C: 70-76%, D: 60-69%, F: 59% and below. In taking the course on a S / NC (pass-fail)
               basis, students must earn a C to receive Satisfactory credit.

         <div id="policies">
               <h2>Course Policies:</h2>
               <p>Each day we are covering material that builds on earlier material and assignments,
                  so your success depends upon regular attendance and completing each assignment on
                  time. </p>
               <!--    <h3>Attendance:</h3>-->
               <p><!--We strictly require your attendance, as it is not only a setback to yourself but
               to the entire class and the success of our projects if students are repeatedly
               absent. Students must attend at least 90% of our class meetings in order <strong>to pass</strong> the course (that is, a maximum of four absences for any reason). Late arrival—particularly
               a pattern of
               repeated late arrivals—may be counted as absences at our discretion. To be considered
               attending for a class period, you
               must be present in the classroom by the beginning of class and until class is
               dismissed. For your own sanity, do not miss two consecutive classes. If you are
               experiencing a genuine emergency or crisis, alert us and provide documentation.
               (We do not want you to attend class if you have a fever or flu-like symptoms! If
               you wish to be excused from two or more consecutive class
               meetings due to your own
               documented illness, please contact one of the following: the Office of the Vice
               President for Academic Affairs, Prof. Jackie Horrall (724-836-7482 or jhorrall at
               pitt.edu), our Campus Health Center (Pamela Reed, 724-836-9947 or
               pmr20 at pitt.edu), or the Director of Counseling, Gayle Pamerleau (gaylep at
               pitt.edu), who can then officially alert all of your professors.--></p>
               <h3>Due dates and why we need them:</h3>
               <p> Your daily homework for this course is time-sensitive! Coding assignments,
                  response papers, and other homework exercises must be uploaded to Canvas (or
                  GitHub or our web server as specified), by the due date and time indicated on the
                  class schedule. Homework assignments will be posted online to our class website
                  and linked from our schedule, so students who miss class are nevertheless expected
                  to consult the schedule and submit assignments on time. Because we post and share
                  answers to homework exercises after submission deadlines, we will usually not
                  accept late homework submissions. </p>
               <h3>Exam Policy:</h3>
               <p>The exams will be take-home, to do on your own time, with submissions due in
                  Canvas  </p>
               <h3>Attendance and Classroom Courtesy:</h3>
               <p>I am not calculating your attendance, but I will expect your active presence and
                  interaction with me and your classmates this semester, as we need to rely on each
                  other to learn and develop projects.</p>
               <p>Our class is fast paced and requires that we all be making the best use we can of
                  our in-person class sessions. Arriving late and leaving early (physically or
                  remotely!) disrupts the important collective mental activity of class. So does
                  in-class texting and checking your cell phone. Whether you are joining over Zoom
                  or in the physical classroom, I ask that you put mobile devices in Do Not Disturb
                  mode. While class is in progress, talking disruptively, leaving the classroom,
                  texting or using a cell phone or computer, reading a newspaper, or other
                  distracting behavior will be actively discouraged. </p>
               <h4>Covid and Attendance</h4>
               <p>When present on campus together this semester, whether in the classroom or
                  elsewhere, <em>always</em> wear a mask and wear it appropriately (over your mouth
                  and nose). We are being provided with some personal protective equipment (PPE) in
                  the form of plastic face shields to be worn <em>in addition to masks</em> if we
                  need to look at each other's computer screens. It is a good idea to bring hand
                  sanitizer with you to campus and sponge off your work area in class. I will ask
                  you to put on your mask if I see you without one, or to fix your mask if you are
                  not wearing it correctly. Non-compliance by any of us means we have to leave the
                  classroom immediately for our own safety, and I have to report anyone not masking
                  or distancing as a violation of the Student Code of Conduct. Remember, <em>My mask
                     protects you; your mask protects me.</em>
               </p>
               <p>Please do not attend our physical class if you are not feeling healthy! This is
                  not the semester to suffer through a fever or chills heroically to attend class in
                  person. Stay home, report symptoms, get tested. This applies to me as your
                  professor as well as to you!</p>
               <p> If you need to miss classes for health reasons, make arrangements with me and
                  your peers to catch up. We will always be meeting on line (via chat and GitHub
                  asynchronously and via Zoom for class meetings) and we will find ways to keep you
                  looped in.</p>
               <p><strong>Our Covid Mixed Mode</strong>: I am planning for the class to be meeting
                  in mixed ways, with some of you attending in Zoom and some of you in the
                  classroom. I hope we can maintain class meetings so we see each other in person
                  once per week before Thanksgiving, but we are ready to be fully remote when
                  needed. I am preparing much course material to be recorded and watched and read on
                  your own time. In-class meetings are paired with synchronized Zoom sessions so you
                  all, wherever you are, can talk to me live. Think of the in-class sessions as live
                  conversations where we share screens and discuss homework, tests, and
                  projects.</p>
               <p>Finally, if I feel as if we are risking our health with in-class meetings, I will
                  simply move us all to Zoom to protect our group. Our health comes first! </p>
               <h4>Student (and Faculty) Health and Wellness Services</h4>
               <p>If any of us, you students or me, are feeling sick, with COVID or flu-like, or
                  other serious ailments this semester, please contact Behrend Student Health &amp;
                  Wellness Services at <b>814-898-6217</b>. None of us can be sure what will happen
                  with the COVID pandemic, and we are taking on a great risk this semester.
                  Reporting in when you do not feel well is not shameful; it is responsible and
                  important to protect yourself and our community.</p>
               <p>Also, this semester may be more stressful than usual with so much uncertainty!
                  Many students at Penn State face personal challenges or have psychological needs
                  that may interfere with their academic progress, social development, or emotional
                  wellbeing. Seek help! The university offers a variety of confidential services to
                  help you through difficult times, including individual and group counseling,
                  crisis intervention, consultations, online chats, and mental health screenings.
                  These services are provided by staff who welcome all students and embrace a
                  philosophy respectful of clients’ cultural and religious backgrounds, and
                  sensitive to differences in race, ability, gender identity and sexual orientation.
                  Counseling and Psychological services are available through the Personal
                  Counseling Office in Reed Union Bldg. Rm 1: <strong>814-898-6504</strong>. </p>
               <h3>Equity</h3>
               <p>Penn State takes great pride to foster a diverse and inclusive environment for
                  students, faculty, and staff. Acts of intolerance, discrimination, or harassment
                  due to age, ancestry, color, disability, gender, gender identity, national origin,
                  race, religious belief, sexual orientation, or veteran status are not tolerated
                  and can be reported through Educational Equity via the Report Bias webpage (<a
                     href="http://equity.psu.edu/reportbias/"
                  >http://equity.psu.edu/reportbias/</a>).</p>
               <h3>E-mail:</h3>
               <p>Each student is issued a University email address (username@psu.edu) upon
                  admission. This email address may be used by the University for official
                  communication with students. Students are expected to read email sent to this
                  account on a regular basis. Failure to read and react to University communications
                  in a timely manner does not absolve the student from knowing and complying with
                  the content of the communications. The University provides an email forwarding
                  service that allows students to read their email via other service providers
                  (e.g., Hotmail, AOL, Yahoo). Students who choose to forward their email from their
                  psu.edu address to another address do so at their own risk. If email is lost as a
                  result of forwarding, it does not absolve the student from responding to official
                  communications sent to their University email address. To forward email sent to
                  your University account, go to http://accounts.psu.edu, log into your account,
                  click on Edit Forwarding Addresses, and follow the instructions on the page. Be
                  sure to log out of your account when you have finished. </p>
               <h3>Academic Integrity</h3>
               <p> Penn State Erie, The Behrend College, puts a very high value on academic
                  integrity, and violations are not tolerated. Academic integrity is the pursuit of
                  scholarly activity in an open, honest and responsible manner. Academic integrity
                  is a basic guiding principle for all academic activity at The Pennsylvania State
                  University, and all members of the University community are expected to act in
                  accordance with this principle. Consistent with this expectation, the University’s
                  Code of Conduct states that all students should act with personal integrity;
                  respect other students’ dignity, rights and property; and help create and maintain
                  an environment in which all can succeed through the fruits of their efforts.
                  Academic integrity includes a commitment by all members of the University
                  community not to engage in or tolerate acts of falsification, misrepresentation or
                  deception. Such acts of dishonesty violate the fundamental ethical principles of
                  the University community and compromise the worth of work completed by others.”
                  (Senate Policy 49-20 and G-9 Procedures. Any violation of academic integrity will
                  receive academic and possibly disciplinary sanctions, including the possible
                  awarding of an XF grade which is recorded on the transcript and states that
                  failure of the course was due to an act of academic dishonesty. All acts of
                  academic dishonesty are recorded so repeat offenders can be sanctioned
                  accordingly. More information on academic integrity can be found at: <a

                  <strong>Source Citation and Plagiarism:</strong> One goal of our course is to
                  reflect on how best to cite sources in digital contexts. We will consider how and
                  why such citations differ from documenting printed texts. We will also consider
                  the ease and frequency with which digital texts and graphics are plagiarized on
                  the worldwide web, and discuss how the omission of source citations detracts from
                  the authority of a digital information resource. We expect you to practice mindful
                  source citation, and plagiarism on your part will have very serious consequences. </p>
               <p>Representing the voice of another individual as your own voice constitutes
                  plagiarism, however generous that person may be in “helping” you with an
                  assignment. Turning in an assignment generated collectively under the name of a
                  single individual is considered plagiarism. <strong>When instructed to collaborate
                     on a project, project collaborators share collective authorship and should
                     identify themselves directly as a team.</strong> To avoid plagiarism, cite your
                  sources whenever you quote, paraphrase, or summarize material, or use digital
                  images from any outside source (including websites, articles, books, course
                  readings, Courseweb or GitHub postings, or someone else’s notes). When using the
                  “copy” and “paste” features as you read and research, be sure that you are
                  carefully marking that these passages are unprocessed from their source, so that
                  you know to process it later. Forgetting to do so not only produces sloppy work
                  but (whether you intended it or not) results in a false representation. As long as
                  you make a good faith and clear effort to cite your sources, you will not be
                  faulted for plagiarism, but your work will be penalized if citations are
                  inaccurate, unclear, or lack important information. </p>
               <p>That said, the coding and digital development we do encourages collaboration, and
                  for that reason we adopt our colleague David Birnbaum's <a
                     href="http://dh.obdurodon.org/collaboration.xhtml">Collaboration policy</a>,
                  since his course is very similar to ours. This policy specifies that students
                  identify collaborators in a comment on submitted asignments and take care on
                  projects that all students contribute equally (and no student is contributing
                  excessively more than what everyone else has done). When joining a group homework
                  session, always work on the assignment by yourself first so you can be an equal
                  participant, and write up the assignment <em>by yourself, after</em> the session
                  is over so you take care not to copy from the other students. While we want you to
                  consult with each other, you are responsible for doing all your writing and coding
                  by yourself, using your own words. </p>
               <h3>Disability Services:</h3>
               <p>Penn State welcomes students with disabilities into the University’s educational
                  programs. Every Penn State campus has an office for students with disabilities.
                  Student Disability Resources (SDR) website provides contact information for every
                  Penn State campus (<a href="http://equity.psu.edu/sdr/disability-coordinator"
                     >http://equity.psu.edu/sdr/disability-coordinator</a>). For further
                  information, please visit Student Disability Resources website (<a
                     href="http://equity.psu.edu/sdr/disability-coordinator"
                     >http://equity.psu.edu/sdr/</a>). In order to receive consideration for
                  reasonable accommodations, you must contact the appropriate disability services
                  office at the campus where you are officially enrolled, participate in an intake
                  interview, and provide documentation: See documentation guidelines (<a
                     href="http://equity.psu.edu/sdr/guidelines"
                     >http://equity.psu.edu/sdr/guidelines</a>). If the documentation supports your
                  request for reasonable accommodations, your campus disability services office will
                  provide you with an accommodation letter. Please share this letter with your
                  instructors and discuss the accommodations with them as early as possible. You
                  must follow this process for every semester that you request accommodations. Penn
                  State Behrend’s Disability Services Coordinator is Stacey Walbridge (<a
