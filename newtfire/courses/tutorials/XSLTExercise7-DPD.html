        <h1><span class="banner">XSLT Exercise 7</span></h1>
        <h3>The texts</h3>
        <p>For this assignment, we set you free to write XSLT on your own project XML files. You may select XML <a href="../studentProjects.html">from any of the project teams this semester</a>, but we will be especially pleased to see you do something interesting with your own project files to begin building interesting and useful website material for your projects.</p>
        <h3>The assignment</h3>
        <p>You may use your own XML
            files or someone else’s. Select an XML file and take some time to review it to make sure you understand its overall structure. (Notice whether it’s in a namespace and change your stylesheet template accordingly!)
            If you are not working with your own project code, visit the project site to learn more about the general project.  Download an XML file from whichever project you choose into
            &lt;oXygen/&gt;.</p>
        <h3>Advice in case you need it: Downloading files from other teams' GitHub repos</h3>
        <p>The easiest way to download a file from GitHub is to clone the project onto your own
            machine, which will copy all files, and then open the file you need. If you want to
            download just one file (which is all you need for this assignment), <em>you can’t just
                right-click and download</em> because you’ll download a version with extraneous
            GitHub specific markup mixed into the file, which will render the file unusable for your
            purposes. What you can do instead is</p>
      <ol>  <li>Connect to the repo in a browser;</li> 
          <li>Click on the file you want, which will display its contents;</li>
          <li>Click on the button labeled <q>Raw</q> at the top of the code window, which will display its contents without
            any extraneous GitHub-specific material; and</li> 
          <li>Either right-click and do a <q>Save as</q> or select all the text in the window, copy it to the clipboard, and paste it
            into a new XML document in &lt;oXygen/&gt;.</li></ol>
        <h3>What to do with the file or collection once you’ve downloaded it</h3>
        <p>Transform the XML into some form of HTML using XSLT, whether that’s a reading view or
            some sorts of lists or tables or other reports. You should decide yourself on the type
            of output you would find interesting or useful, but so that you’ll gain practice with
            some of the techniques we’ve introduced recently, your transformation must require
            meaningful use of <strong>at least two of the following:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Conditional: an <code>&lt;xsl:if&gt;</code> and/or <code>&lt;xsl:choose&gt;</code>
                statement(s) (see <a href="http://dh.obdurodon.org/xslt-basics-2.xhtml">XSLT, part 2: conditionals and push
                    and pull</a>)</li>
            <li>An <code>&lt;xsl:for-each&gt;</code> statement (see <a href="http://dh.obdurodon.org/xslt-basics-2.xhtml"
                >XSLT, part 2: conditionals and push and pull</a>)</li>
            <li>Attribute value templates (see <a href="http://dh.obdurodon.org/avt.xhtml">Attribute value templates
                (AVT)</a>)</li>
            <li>Modal XSLT (see <a href="http://dh.obdurodon.org/modal-xslt.html">Modal XSLT</a>)</li>
            <li>Linking (see <a href="http://newtfire.org/dh/XSLTExercise6.html">XSLT Exercise 6</a>)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Please upload your input XML, your XSLT, your output HTML, and (if applicable), your CSS to CourseWeb. If your HTML is styled with CSS be sure
            that your XSLT generates the necessary &lt;link&gt; element inside HTML document, and upload the CSS file along with the XSLT.</p>
