   	  <h3>The task</h3>
       <p>We begin with a plain-text file, <a
           href="stoker-dracula.txt">the Project Gutenberg EBook of <cite>Dracula</cite></a>, by Bram Stoker. Download the file and save it to your computer, so you can open it locally in &lt;oXygen/&gt; (where it will open as a plain text file). 
            We want to convert this file to XML
            but we don’t want to type all of the angle brackets manually. So what can we tag
            automatically, with global find-and-replace operations? For certain kinds of projects we might actually want to wrap tags around every word of the text,
            but, at a minimum, we can autotag chapters, chapter titles, paragraphs, and quotations
            using regex tools, and that’s the goal of the present assignment. Here is <a href="stoker-dracula.xml">an example of the finished XML</a> we want to create with this exercise.</p>
        <h3>Preliminaries</h3>
       <p>Prepare a Step File: open a <strong>new, separate text file</strong>, in which you will record each step you take in up-converting this document to XML. This needs to be a plain text (<code>*.txt</code>) or markdown (<code>*.md</code>) file and not something you write in a word processor (<em>not</em> a Microsoft Word document) so you do not have to struggle with autocorrections of the regex patterns you are recording. In this file you will record each step you take and paste in the patterns you apply in the Find and Replace windows in &lt;oXygen/&gt;. (Save your Step file following our standard homework filenaming conventions for homework submitted on Canvas.)</p>
       <h3>Overview of the conversion process</h3>
       We will try to do this conversion in a set order just to guide you as you are learning. 
       In reality, you can do some of these tasks in a different sequence, but if you want to follow our tutorial guide below, try to stick to this order.
       Each step in this overview is linked to a detailed explanation of how to approach the task.
       <ol>
           <li>Start your record each of your steps in a markdown file, that you save as <code>.md</code>. Record your steps like this, using tic marks to wrap the regular expressions you use:
               <pre>
                  First I looked for blah blah...
                     Find: `&amp;`
                     Replace `&amp;amp;`
                  
                  Then I tried to blah blah... 
               </pre>
           </li>
           <li><a href="#reserv">Search and replace reserved characters</a>: <code>&amp;</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code></li>
           <li><a href="#blanks">Set up regex find &amp; replace in oXygen, and remove extra blank lines</a> (Replace with just two blanks in a row so you can see the chapter and paragraph divisions.)</li>
           <li><a href="#paras">Find and mark all long lines of text as paragraphs inside `<code>&lt;p&gt;....&lt;/p&gt;</code> tags</a>.</li>
           <li><a href="#heads">Find all chapter titles and wrap them in <code>&lt;heading&gt;</code> start and end tags.</a>
               <ul><li>You will need a regular expression pattern that isolates just the chapter headings.</li>
                   <li>Your replace will need to remove the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tags around the chapter lines. (Use capturing groups in your find, and refer to them in your replace.)</li>
               </ul>
           </li>
           <li><a href="#chaps">Wrap whole chapters with <code>&lt;chapter&gt;</code> start and end tags</a>. (Use our <q>close-open</q> strategy.)
               After this, the chapter titles and body paragraphs will be nested inside chapter elements in your XML hierarchy. 
               Here is a simple view of the hierarchy you are building:
               <pre>
               &lt;xml&gt; 
                   &lt;chapter&gt;
                       &lt;heading&gt;.....&lt;/heading&gt;
                       &lt;p&gt;....&lt;/p&gt;
                       &lt;p&gt;.....&lt;/p&gt;
                       &lt;p&gt;.....&lt;/p&gt;
                       ...
                   &lt;/chapter&gt; 
                   &lt;chapter&gt;
                       &lt;heading&gt;....&lt;/heading&gt;
                       &lt;p&gt;........&lt;/p&gt;
                       &lt;p&gt;....&lt;/p&gt;
                       &lt;p&gt;.....&lt;/p&gt;
                       &lt;p&gt;.....&lt;/p&gt;
                       ...
                   &lt;/chapter&gt;
                  ...
  
               &lt;/xml&gt;
           </pre>
           </li>
           <li><a href="#quotes">Find and auto-tag the spoken passages inside single lines</a>.
               Try setting the <code>?</code> as a <q>don't-be-greedy</q> check on the <code>.+</code> pattern. 
               Replace the quotation marks with <code>&lt;q&gt;</code> start and end tags.</li>
           <li><a href="#cleanup">Manually clean up the XML you have created</a>: look for extra close tags from the times you used the <q>close-open</q> strategy on paragraphs and chapters for example.

           </li>
           <li><a href="#check">Check if your work is well-formed XML</a>: Save the file as XML with a <code>.xml</code> file extension. Close it and re-open it in oXygen and make sure it is well-formed. </li>
           <li><a href="#dateTime">See if you can autotag dates and times in the novel.</a> Try starting searches for digits in the docume with <code>\d</code> and get a sense of the distinct patterns for dates and times.</li>
           <li><a href="#submit">Submit your work</a>: We need to see your Markdown file where you recorded your steps, and you may also submit the XML file you created on Courseweb. </li>
       </ol>
        <h3>Step by step</h3>
        <p>There’s more than one way to accomplish this task, but one way to approach the problem is
            as follows:</p>
        <h4 id="reserv">Reserved characters</h4>
       <p>The plain text file could, at least in principle, contain characters that have special
           meaning in XML: the ampersand and the angle brackets. You need to search for those and
           replace them with their corresponding XML entities. (These are those character strings that start with an <code>&amp;</code> character.) 
           You can read some detailed information about entity strings and what they are for on Obdurodon’s <q>Entities and numerical character references</q>
           section of <a href="http://dh.obdurodon.org/what-is-xml.xhtml"
               >http://dh.obdurodon.org/what-is-xml.xhtml</a>, but for just a quick list, see <q>Special Reserved Characters</q> at the bottom of our <a href="explainXML.html">Introducing XML tutorial</a>. Note that you need to process them
           in the correct order, because of the ampersand (<code>&amp;</code>) in each one! 
           Think about this carefully: You <strong>always</strong> want to replace the &amp; characters first. (Why? Explain in your homework write-up.)</p>
     
        <h4 id="blanks">Extra blank lines</h4>
        <p>The blank lines are pseudo-markup that tell us where titles and paragraphs begin and end,
            but in some cases there are multiple blank lines in a row (for example, there are two
            blank lines between the title and the word <q>by</q>). Those extra blank lines don’t
            tell us anything useful, so we’ll start by getting rid of them. We want to retain one blank line (two newline characters) between titles and paragraphs, etc., but not more than that.</p>
        <p>To perform regex searching, you need to check the box labeled <q>Regular expression</q>
            at the bottom of the &lt;oXygen/&gt; find-and-replace dialog box, which you open with
            Control-f (Windows) or Command-f (Mac). If you don’t check the <q>Regular expression</q>
            box, &lt;oXygen/&gt; will just search for what you type literally, and it won’t
            recognize that some characters in regex have special meaning. You don’t have to check
            anything else yet.</p>
        <p>The regex escape code that matches a new line is <code>\n</code>, so you want to search
            for more than two of those in succession, and you want to replace them with exactly two.
            You can search for three blank lines and replace them with two and then keep repeating
            the process until there are no instances of three blank lines left, or, more elegantly
            and efficiently, you can search for <code>\n{3,}</code>, which matches three or more new
            line characters in succession (see the <q>Limiting repetition</q> section of <a
                href="http://www.regular-expressions.info/repeat.html"
                >http://www.regular-expressions.info/repeat.html</a>) and replace them with
                <code>\n\n</code> (the quantifiers work only in the Find window, but not in replacements, so
            you have to write it this way).</p>
        <p>Note that a transformation that searches for a sequence of two end-of-line characters
            depends on their being immediately adjacent to each other. If what looks like a blank
            line to you actually has (invisible) spaces or tabs, the pattern won’t match and the
            replacement won’t happen because there will be spaces or tabs between the end-of-line
            characters, which is to say that they won’t be adjacent. If you think that might be the
            case, you can make those characters visible by going into the &lt;oXygen/&gt;
            preferences (Preferences → Editor) and checking the boxes labeled <q>Show
                TAB/NBSP/EOL/EOF marks</q> and <q>Show SPACE marks</q> under Whitespaces. If you do
            have whitespace characters interfering with your ability to find a blank line (that is,
            two consecutive new line characters), you can use regex processing to replace them: the
            pattern <code>\t</code> matches a tab character, a space matches a space, and
                <code>\s+</code> matches one or more white-space characters of any sort (including
            new lines). You can use the <q>Find</q> or <q>Find all</q> options in the
            find-and-replace dialog to explore the document and make sure that you’re matching what
            you want to match before you use <q>Replace all</q> to make the changes.</p>
        <h4 id="paras">Paragraphs</h4>
        <p>We are working from the inside out, starting by wrapping tags around every line of text content. Make sure Dot matches all is turned off, and then 
        search for one or more of any character between the start of a line and the end of a line. Remember the <code>^</code> signals the start of a line, and <code>$</code> signals the end of the line. Hint: You can replace by referring to the whole match and wrapping <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> start and <code>&lt;/p&gt;</code> end tags around it.</p>
        <h4 id="heads">Chapter titles</h4>
        <p>The title of the first chapter within the body looks like:</p>
        <pre>&lt;p&gt;CHAPTER I&lt;/p&gt;</pre>
        <p>the second looks like:</p>
       <pre>&lt;p&gt;CHAPTER II&lt;/p&gt;</pre>
        <p>and we can see easily, from the list of chapter titles at the top, that there are
            27 chapter titles, each of which begins with the word CHAPTER. If we can write a regex that matches chapter headings and only chapter
            headings, then, we can replace the paragraph markup with heading markup, retaining the part
            in the middle.</p>
        <p>We’re not going to write that regex for you, but we will tell you the pieces we used. Try
            building a regex and running <q>Find all</q> to verify that it is matching all of the
            chapter titles and nothing else. When you can match what you need, then you can think
            about how to craft the replacement string. Here are the pieces:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>First make sure that, under <q>Options</q>, <q>Case sensitive</q> is checked and
                        <q>Dot matches all</q> is unchecked. You want to do case sensitive matching
                    because the Roman numeral characters here are all upper case, so you want to be
                    able to distinguish those from lower case <q>i</q>, <q>v</q>, <q>x</q>, etc.
                    We’ll discuss when to use <q>Dot matches all</q> below, but for now, make sure
                    that it’s unchecked.</p></li>
           
            <li><p>A chapter heading is (now) wrapped (misleadingly) in <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tags
                    and fills a single line. You can take advantage of
                    that fact by searching for lines that begin with <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> and end
                    with <code>&lt;/p&gt;</code>. How can  you quickly isolate all 27 chapters? What pattern do they all share in common?</p></li>
           
            <li><p>You now need to
                    replace the paragraph tags with <code>&lt;heading&gt;</code> tags. To do that we
                    need to <dfn>capture</dfn> the part of the title line that’s between the
                    paragraph tags and write that captured text into the replacement. To capture
                    part of a regex, you wrap it in parentheses; this doesn’t match parenthesis
                    characters, but it does make the part of the regex that’s between the
                    parentheses available for reuse in the replacement string. For example,
                        <code>a(b)c</code> would match the sequence <q>abc</q> and capture the
                        <q>b</q> in the middle, so that it could be written into the replacement.
                    Capturing a single literal character value isn’t very useful because you could
                    have just written the <q>b</q> into the replacement literally, but you can also
                    capture wildcard matches. For example, <code>a(.)c</code> matches a sequence of
                    a literal <q>a</q> character followed by any single character except a new line
                    followed by a literal <q>c</q> character. To get more than a single character, you need a repetition indicator.
                You can use that information to
                    capture everything between the paragraph tags in the matched string. To write a
                    captured pattern into the replacement, use a backslash followed by a digit,
                    where <code>\1</code> means the first capture group, <code>\2</code> means the
                    second, etc. In this case you’re capturing only one group, so you can build a
                    replacement string that starts with <code>&lt;heading&gt;</code>, ends with
                        <code>&lt;/heading&gt;</code>, and puts <code>\1</code> between them. You
                    don’t need to do anything about the line start and line end anchors; since
                    you’ve matched an entire line, the replacement will automatically be an entire
                    line.</p></li>
            <li>Putting this all together, you should be able to retag your headings automatically,
                removing their <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tags and replacing them with <code>&lt;heading&gt;</code> tags. Try it.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="chaps">Chapters</h4>
        <p>A book isn’t just a series of paragraphs with titles strewn among them; the book has
            logical chapters, which must begin with a title, and you want to represent this part of
            the logical document hierarchy in your markup by inserting <code>&lt;chapter&gt;</code>
            tags. Much as you used blank lines as <dfn>milestone</dfn> delimiters between paragraphs
            earlier, you can now use your <code>&lt;heading&gt;</code> elements as delimiters between
            chapters. Use a find-and-replace operation to do this; you’ll have to clean up the
            markup before the first chapter and after the last one manually, since in those cases
            the <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> element doesn’t have the same milestone function as
            elsewhere.</p>
        <h4 id="quotes">Quotes</h4>
        <p>How are quotations represented in the plain text? How would you find the text of a
            quotation, that is, how would you find where it starts, where it ends, and what goes
            between the start and the end? Files on the Internet sometimes have errors and
            inconsistencies; if you’re relying on cues in the text to identify the beginnings and
            ends of quotations, what can happen if you miss one?</p>
        <p>Quotation marks in the Dracula document are all straight quotation marks instead of the curly quotes. 
           Matching and tagging the spoken passages inside quotation marks raises a few concerns:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A line may have more than one quotation. If we write a regex like <code>".+"</code>
                (including the quotation marks), will we match each quotation individually, or will
                we match the first quotation mark on the line and the last, erroneously gobbling up
                everything between into one spurious quotation? Try it and see.</li>
            <li>Some quotations span multiple lines. Since the dot matches any character except a
                new line, if we write <code>".+"</code> and the start and end quotation marks are on
                different lines, we’ll fail to match those quotations, and we may erroneously match
                material between ending and starting quotation marks, instead of only between
                starting and ending ones. Try it and see.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Let’s address the second problem first. There’s a line in the text that reads:</p>
        <pre>&lt;p&gt;"But, Count," I said, "you know and speak English thoroughly!" He bowed gravely.&lt;/p&gt;</pre>
        <p>This passage shows two split up quotes. If we write <code>".+"</code> (with Dot matches all turned OFF), we will match <em>too far</em> from the start of the 
            first quote to the end of the last quote. Uh oh! This means we have made a <dfn>greedy match</dfn> and missed the inner set of quotation marks. 
We can resolve the problem by specifying that the match should be
                <dfn>non-greedy</dfn>, that is, that we should make the <em>shortest</em> possible
            match (instead of the longest, which is the default), and we do this by following the
            repetition indicator (the plus sign) with a question mark. (Note that the question mark
            you met earlier is a repetition indicator that means <q>zero or one instance</q> of
            whatever it follows. Here is isn’t a repetition indicator, though; here it means
                <q>don’t be greedy</q>. So if the same symbol can have two such different meanings,
            how does a regex processor know which meaning to apply?) In other words
                <code>".+?"</code> will correctly treat two full quotations on the same line as
            separate quotations. Try it. You should now correctly be matching each quotation fully,
            regardless of whether it spans a new line character and regardless of the number of
            quotations on a line.</p>
        <p>Once you can do that, you can capture the text between the quotation marks and write it
            into the output between <code>&lt;quote&gt;</code> tags. Don’t include the quotation
            mark characters themselves in the capture group; those are plain-text pseudo-markup, and
            now that you’re going to be tagging quotations with real markup, you don’t want the
            quotation mark characters included.</p>
        <h4 id="cleanup">Cleanup</h4>
        <p>At this point you can fix the title at the top manually, and you need to wrap the entire document in
            a root element (such as <code>&lt;book&gt;</code>). Check to see if you need to move stray close tags at the top of the document and missing close tags at the bottom from your chapter tagging.</p>
        <h4 id="check">Checking your results</h4>
        <p>Although you’ve added XML markup to the document, &lt;oXygen/&gt; remembers that you
            opened it as plain text, which means that you can’t check it for well-formedness. To fix
            that, save it as XML with File → Save as and give it the extension <code>.xml</code>. Even
            that doesn’t tell &lt;oXygen/&gt; that you’ve changed the file type, though; you have to
            close the file and reopen it. When you do that, &lt;oXygen/&gt; now knows that it’s XML,
            so you can verify that it’s well formed in the usual way: Control+Shift+W on Windows,
            Command+Shift+W on Mac, or click on the arrow next to the red check mark in the icon bar
            at the top and choose <q>Check well-formedness</q>. If &lt;oXygen/&gt; signals green for well-formed, go ahead and pretty-print the file to see the hierarchy you created.</p>
       <h4 id="dateTime">Autotagging dates and times</h4>
       <p>You can continue applying regular expression Find and Replace after you save the document as well-formed XML, since XML is made out of patterned text after all. Since <cite>Dracula</cite> contains journal entries, we can see dates as well as times of day mentioned throughout the file. Continue practicing your regex skills to see if you figure out a pattern for matching the dates and/or times. Try searching first for any digit <code>\d</code> to get a quick look at the different ways numbers are formatted, and see if you can identify distinctive patterns for dates vs. times. Even if you do not match all of them,  see how many you can find. (You may want to do a few different passes to capture times with and without a colon for example.)</p>
        <h3 id="submit">What to submit</h3>
       <p>On Canvas, upload two things (or a zip directory containing the following):</p>
       <ol>
           <li>a step file in markdown or txt (a step-by-step description of what you did), and</li>
           <li>your results file (the XML document)</li>
       </ol>
       
       <p>If you don’t get all the way to a solution, just upload the description of what you did,
           what the output looked like, and why you were not able to proceed any further. As you are working on this,
           post any questions on our class GitHub Issues board!</p>
