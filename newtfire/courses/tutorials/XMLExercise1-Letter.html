            <h3>Before you begin</h3>
            <p>Before beginning this assignment, you should prepare your workspace: Where 
                do you want to do your coding homework this semester? You will be doing most of
                your coding work for this course in the &lt;oXygen/&gt; XML Editor. This is
                installed in the campus computer labs, and you may also install it on any other
                computer(s) you plan to work with this semester. Also, before beginning homework
                assignments, you need to read the related tutorials we have posted (plus notes you
                took in class) and keep these open and handy to consult as you are working. For the
                very first assignment, here is what you will need:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Install the &lt;oXygen/&gt; software on your own computer(s) Follow the <a
                        href="http://canvas.psu.edu">instructions and apply the license key we
                        have posted on Canvas</a>.</li>
                <li>Read our <a href="explainXML.html"><q>Introduction to XML</q></a></li>
                <li>Read <a href="explainFileNames.html"><q>File Conventions for Canvas
                            Assignments</q></a>, so you will know how to name this and most other
                    homework files you submit on Canvas.</li>

            </ul>

            <h3>Goals</h3>
            <p>This assignment should give you experience with:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Writing <dfn>well-formed</dfn> XML using elements and attributes.</li>
                <li>Making decisions in how to write XML so that it binds related kinds of
                    information together by: <ul>
                        <li>Thinking of elements and attributes working together (like file folders
                            with labels attached).</li>
                        <li><dfn>Nesting</dfn> elements that relate to each other.</li>
                        <li>Thinking about the relationship between your markup and the source document.</li>
                    </ul></li>
                <li>Using basic features of the &lt;oXygen/&gt; software environment.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>
        <section title="scenario">
            <h3>Scenario</h3>
            <p>Imagine yourself as a curator of historical letters by a famous writer from a past century, and you are building a digital resource that makes this author's personal letters available to read and search for interesting kinds of information, and to help <q>bring the past to life</q> for your readers. 
                The kinds of information you choose to mark up in XML are up to you, but think of the code you apply as <em>the basis for coding many more letters written by the same person</em>.</p>
        </section>
        <section title="step_by_step">
            <h3>Choose a letter</h3>
            <p>Choose the text of one letter linked on one of
                the following websites (click through until you see a complete letter with a writer and a recipient), and
                copy all relevant text into a new XML document in &lt;oXygen/&gt;. Then, mark it up in well-formed XML, using your own
                system of tagging, as seems appropriate, to code the structure and the
                content of the document. <strong>Important:</strong> Save and name your XML document according to the
                <a href="explainFileNames.html">File Conventions</a> and be sure it as the proper <code>.xml</code> file extension before you upload to Courseweb!</p>
            <h3>Options:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="http://glc.yale.edu/harriet-jacobs-selected-writings-and-correspondence-documents">Harriet Jacobs (choose one of the letters: this is a selection of letters between people involved in Harriet Jacobs' flight from slavery and writing of her autobiography before the Civil War).</a>
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    <a href="http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/wilde/lettersfromwilde.html">Oscar Wilde (choose one of the letters used as evidence in a famous English court trial of 1895).</a>
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Coding the letter in &lt;oXygen/&gt;</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>First, highlight and copy the text of the document that is relevant for representing the historic letter you have selected. (Consider including information surrounding the letter, as well as the letter itself.)</li>

                <li>Open a new XML document in &lt;oXygen/&gt;. Click on the icon at top left that
                    looks like a piece of paper with a folded corner (or go to File and New...),
                    type <code>XML</code> in the filter window, and click the <code>Create</code>
                    button to launch a new XML document.</li>
                <li>Paste in the text you intend to mark up, and begin marking it to apply <dfn>elements</dfn> and add
                        <dfn>attributes</dfn>.</li>
                <li>Tips: Watch the color of the square in the upper right corner: if it is green,
                    your code is well-formed, but if it turns <q>angry red</q>, you will know there
                    is an error, perhaps <dfn>tangled tags</dfn> or a missing angle bracket, or a
                    missing <dfn>root element</dfn>. Notice how &lt;oXygen/&gt; generates a closing
                    tag every time you type your own start tag. One handy trick is to you use your
                    mouse to highlight text you want to wrap in an element, and use Control+E in
                    Windows (or Command+E on a Mac) to bring up a window to enter an element name.
                    (You have to add the attributes after you set an element name.)</li>
                <li>Save your work frequently, and name your file using our <a
                        href="explainFileNames.html">standard form for homework names</a>.</li>
            </ul>

        <section title="suggestions">
            <h3>Curating the document: Suggestions for XML markup</h3>
            <p>Frequently the XML code we write is designed for <dfn>digital curation</dfn>, for
                preserving and collecting resources. We would certainly not rewrite the<dfn>base
                    text</dfn> of a writer's personal correspondence, but we would apply markup <em>around</em> passages, so
                that our markup supplies some information in a more systematic way. For example,
                spaces and formatting on the page tell our human eyes something about the document,
                like how to distinguish each item on a list. That formatting information is
                    <strong>not preserved</strong> in XML, and so one of the first things we mark
                are the structural <q>pieces</q>. What are the important parts of this document that
                you need to distinguish from other parts? Use XML markup to <q>tag</q> those. Then,
                what is the important information that you can label with markup?</p>
            <h4>Tips: </h4><ul><li>Try not to code
                element and attributes that copy the same words and phrases in the text. think of categories, 
                standard units, or simple identifiers you can supply so that your markup <em>adds new value</em> to the
                text. </li>
                <li>Try to use elements and attribute names that you imagine <em>repeating</em> if you were coding many letters in a project. Think about how to keep the coding manageable and not too complicated for others to continue.</li>
                <li>Consider adding elements (perhaps a note with your own text inside) to annotate the document or represent some of the contextual information available with the text. 
                How do you separate your voice, or others' voices from the original letter-writer's voice?</li></ul>
   
            <p>There is no single way to do this exercise, but we want you to think about how you
                nest levels of information (elements within elements), and the relationship between
                elements and attributes in XML.</p>
