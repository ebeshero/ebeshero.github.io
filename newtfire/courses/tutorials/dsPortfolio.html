      <h1><span class="banner">Web Portfolio Standards for DIGIT Students</span></h1>
      			
      			
     <p>The following are standards for the development of digital portfolios to satisfy completion requirements for <a href="https://bulletins.psu.edu/undergraduate/colleges/behrend/digital-media-arts-technology-ba">the DIGIT major</a> or <a href="https://bulletins.psu.edu/undergraduate/colleges/liberal-arts/digital-humanities-minor/#programrequirementstext">the Digital Humanities Minor</a> at <a href="https://behrend.psu.edu/">Penn State Erie, The Behrend College</a>. </p>		
      			
     <ul>
        
        
       <li>Portfolios may be developed in any personally manageable web space that the student chooses, though we recommend the students use their individual web directory on <a href="http://newtfire.org">NewtFire.org</a> (used in DIGIT 400 and other DIGIT courses), Penn State University's personal web space at either <a href="https://personal.psu.edu">https://personal.psu.edu</a> or <a href="https://sites.psu.edu/">sites.psu.edu</a>, or <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages, free to set up on a GitHub repository</a>. </li>
        <li>Web portfolios must meet the following standards:
        <ul>
          
           <li>Brief (paragraph-length) descriptions and links to each publically-accessible digital project to which you have contributed in your courses connected with the DIGIT program. (If you worked on a project that you cannot link to because it is not available for public view, provide a title and description and, if available, links for further information on the course, the project, or your work.)</li>
           <li>For each project featured, include information on the semester (Fall 2020), course title and number (DIGIT 400: Digital Project Design), and the professor(s) and students with whom you worked.</li>
          <li>Descriptions of group projects must highlight your contributions to the project. Point out what you worked on, and feature it in some way.</li>
          <li>Your projects should feature a Creative Commons License appropriate for your work, and/or make clear any proprietary restrictions, that is, any work that is owned by another party. 
          <ul>
            <li>Be mindful of proprietary restrictions and whether your work is entirely your own to share. You are responsible for requesting and securing permission from the appropriate parties who own copyright on material you worked on or featured, and following their instructions (such as a link and clear reference to the source site).</li>
            <li>Any faculty member on the Digital Studies committee will be happy to guide and assist you with this process.</li>
          </ul>
          </li>
         <li>Content on the portfolio page must be organized in some clear way, perhaps to separate different kinds of projects and technologies applied. Some prefacing explanation is useful to introduce and reflect on your work.</li>  
           <li>The portfolio page must include a linked online résumé, that should be prepared for web searching. Ideally this should be prepared in HTML and not PDF or Word form. </li>
           <li>The portfolio page or the résumé must contain a list of computing technologies and skills you have learned as a student. </li>
           
           
        </ul>
        
        
        
        </li>
        <li>Web Portfolio pages must pass W3C Validation for the standard form of HTML (currently HTML 5). You can check your portfolio's validity in the &lt;oXygen/&gt; editing software or through the <a href="http://validator.w3.org/">World Wide Web Consortiums's Markup Validation Service</a>.
        </li>
