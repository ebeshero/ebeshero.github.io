         <head rend="h2">PREFACE.</head>
         <p>The First Volume of these Poems has already been submitted to general perusal. It was
            published, as an experiment which, I hoped, might be of some use to ascertain, how far,
            by fitting to metrical arrangement a selection of the real language of men in a state of
            vivid sensation, that sort of pleasure and that quantity of pleasure may be imparted,
            which a Poet may rationally endeavour to impart. </p>

         <p> I had formed no very inaccurate estimate of the probable effect of those Poems: I
            flattered myself that they who should be pleased with them would read them with more
            than common pleasure: and on the other hand I was well aware that by those who should
            dislike them they would be read with more than common dislike. The result has differed
            from my expectation in this only, that I have pleased a greater number, than I ventured
            to hope I should please. </p>

         <p>For the sake of variety and from a consciousness of my own weakness I was induced to
            request the assistance of a Friend, who furnished me with the Poems of the ANCIENT
            MARINER, the FOSTER-MOTHER’S TALE, the NIGHTINGALE, the DUNGEON, and the Poem entitled
            LOVE. I should not, however, have requested this assistance, had I not believed that the
            poems of my Friend would in a great measure have the same tendency as my own, and that,
            though there would be found a difference, there would be found no discordance in the
            colours of our style; as our opinions on the subject of poetry do almost entirely
            coincide. </p>

         <p>Several of my Friends are anxious for the success of these Poems from a belief, that if
            the views, with which they were composed, were indeed realized, a class of Poetry would
            be produced, well adapted to interest mankind permanently, and not unimportant in the
            multiplicity and in the quality of its moral relations: and on this account they have
            advised me to prefix a systematic defence of the theory, upon which the poems were
            written. But I was unwilling to undertake the task, because I knew that on this occasion
            the Reader would look coldly upon my arguments, since I might be suspected of having
            been principally influenced by the selfish and foolish hope of reasoning him into an
            approbation of these particular Poems: and I was still more unwilling to undertake the
            task, because adequately to display my opinions and fully to enforce my arguments would
            require a space wholly disproportionate to the nature of a preface. For to treat the
            subject with the clearness and coherence, of which I believe it susceptible, it would be
            necessary to give a full account of the present state of the public taste in this
            country, and to determine how far this taste is healthy or depraved; which again could
            not be determined, without pointing out, in what manner language and the human mind act
            and react on each other, and without retracing the revolutions not of literature alone
            but likewise of society itself. I have therefore altogether declined to enter regularly
            upon this defence; yet I am sensible, that there would be some impropriety in abruptly
            obtruding upon the Public, without a few words of introduction, Poems so materially
            different from those, upon which general approbation is at present bestowed. </p>

         <p>It is supposed, that by the act of writing in verse an Author makes a formal engagement
            that he will gratify certain known habits of association, that he not only thus apprizes
            the Reader that certain classes of ideas and expressions will be found in his book, but
            that others will be carefully excluded. This exponent or symbol held forth by metrical
            language must in different aeras of literature have excited very different expectations:
            for example, in the age of Catullus Terence and Lucretius, and that of Statius or
            Claudian, and in our own country, in the age of Shakespeare and Beaumont and Fletcher,
            and that of Donne and Cowley, or Dryden, or Pope. I will not take upon me to determine
            the exact import of the promise which by the act of writing in verse an Author in the
            present day makes to his Reader; but I am certain it will appear to many persons that I
            have not fulfilled the terms of an engagement thus voluntarily contracted. I hope
            therefore the Reader will not censure me, if I attempt to state what I have proposed to
            myself to perform, and also, (as far as the limits of a preface will permit) to explain
            some of the chief reasons which have determined me in the choice of my purpose: that at
            least he may be spared any unpleasant feeling of disappointment, and that I myself may
            be protected from the most dishonorable accusation which can be brought against an
            Author, namely, that of an indolence which prevents him from endeavouring to ascertain
            what is his duty, or, when his duty is ascertained prevents him from performing it. </p>

         <p>The principal object then which I proposed to myself in these Poems was to make the
            incidents of common life interesting by tracing in them, truly though not
            ostentatiously, the primary laws of our nature: chiefly as far as regards the manner in
            which we associate ideas in a state of excitement. Low and rustic life was generally
            chosen because in that situation the essential passions of the heart find a better soil
            in which they can attain their maturity, are less under restraint, and speak a plainer
            and more emphatic language; because in that situation our elementary feelings exist in a
            state of greater simplicity and consequently may be more accurately contemplated and
            more forcibly communicated; because the manners of rural life germinate from those
            elementary feelings; and from the necessary character of rural occupations are more
            easily comprehended; and are more durable; and lastly, because in that situation the
            passions of men are incorporated with the beautiful and permanent forms of nature. The
            language too of these men is adopted (purified indeed from what appear to be its real
            defects, from all lasting and rational causes of dislike or disgust) because such men
            hourly communicate with the best objects from which the best part of language is
            originally derived; and because, from their rank in society and the sameness and narrow
            circle of their intercourse, being less under the action of social vanity they convey
            their feelings and notions in simple and unelaborated expressions. Accordingly such a
            language arising out of repeated experience and regular feelings is a more permanent and
            a far more philosophical language than that which is frequently substituted for it by
            Poets, who think that they are conferring honour upon themselves and their art in
            proportion as they separate themselves from the sympathies of men, and indulge in
            arbitrary and capricious habits of expression in order to furnish food for fickle tastes
            and fickle appetites of their own creation.<note resp="#WW" anchored="true" n="1"
               >[Footnote 1: It is worth while here to observe that the affecting parts of Chaucer
               are almost always expressed in language pure and universally intelligible even to
               this day.]</note>
         </p>


         <p> I cannot be insensible of the present outcry against the triviality and meanness both
            of thought and language, which some of my contemporaries have occasionally introduced
            into their metrical compositions; and I acknowledge that this defect where it exists, is
            more dishonorable to the Writer’s own character than false refinement or arbitrary
            innovation, though I should contend at the same time that it is far less pernicious in
            the sum of its consequences. From such verses the Poems in these volumes will be found
            distinguished at least by one mark of difference, that each of them has a worthy
            purpose. Not that I mean to say, that I always began to write with a distinct purpose
            formally conceived; but I believe that my habits of meditation have so formed my
            feelings, as that my descriptions of such objects as strongly excite those feelings,
            will be found to carry along with them a purpose. If in this opinion I am mistaken I can
            have little right to the name of a Poet. For all good poetry is the spontaneous overflow
            of powerful feelings; but though this be true, Poems to which any value can be attached,
            were never produced on any variety of subjects but by a man who being possessed of more
            than usual organic sensibility had also thought long and deeply. For our continued
            influxes of feeling are modified and directed by our thoughts, which are indeed the
            representatives of all our past feelings; and as by contemplating the relation of these
            general representatives to each other, we discover what is really important to men, so
            by the repetition and continuance of this act feelings connected with important subjects
            will be nourished, till at length, if we be originally possessed of much organic
            sensibility, such habits of mind will be produced that by obeying blindly and
            mechanically the impulses of those habits we shall describe objects and utter sentiments
            of such a nature and in such connection with each other, that the understanding of the
            being to whom we address ourselves, if he be in a healthful state of association, must
            necessarily be in some degree enlightened, his taste exalted, and his affections
            ameliorated. </p>

         <p> I have said that each of these poems has a purpose. I have also informed my Reader what
            this purpose will be found principally to be: namely to illustrate the manner in which
            our feelings and ideas are associated in a state of excitement. But speaking in less
            general language, it is to follow the fluxes and refluxes of the mind when agitated by
            the great and simple affections of our nature. This object I have endeavoured in these
            short essays to attain by various means; by tracing the maternal passion through many of
            its more subtle windings, as in the poems of the IDIOT BOY and the MAD MOTHER; by
            accompanying the last struggles of a human being at the approach of death, cleaving in
            solitude to life and society, as in the Poem of the FORSAKEN INDIAN; by shewing, as in
            the Stanzas entitled WE ARE SEVEN, the perplexity and obscurity which in childhood
            attend our notion of death, or rather our utter inability to admit that notion; or by
            displaying the strength of fraternal, or to speak more philosophically, of moral
            attachment when early associated with the great and beautiful objects of nature, as in
            THE BROTHERS; or, as in the Incident of SIMON LEE, by placing my Reader in the way of
            receiving from ordinary moral sensations another and more salutary impression than we
            are accustomed to receive from them. It has also been part of my general purpose to
            attempt to sketch characters under the influence of less impassioned feelings, as in the
            OLD MAN TRAVELLING, THE TWO THIEVES, &amp;c. characters of which the elements are
            simple, belonging rather to nature than to manners, such as exist now and will probably
            always exist, and which from their constitution may be distinctly and profitably
            contemplated. I will not abuse the indulgence of my Reader by dwelling longer upon this
            subject; but it is proper that I should mention one other circumstance which
            distinguishes these Poems from the popular Poetry of the day; it is this, that the
            feeling therein developed gives importance to the action and situation and not the
            action and situation to the feeling. My meaning will be rendered perfectly intelligible
            by referring my Reader to the Poems entitled POOR SUSAN and the CHILDLESS FATHER,
            particularly to the last Stanza of the latter Poem. </p>

         <p> I will not suffer a sense of false modesty to prevent me from asserting, that I point
            my Reader’s attention to this mark of distinction far less for the sake of these
            particular Poems than from the general importance of the subject. The subject is indeed
            important! For the human mind is capable of excitement without the application of gross
            and violent stimulants; and he must have a very faint perception of its beauty and
            dignity who does not know this, and who does not further know that one being is elevated
            above another in proportion as he possesses this capability. It has therefore appeared
            to me that to endeavour to produce or enlarge this capability is one of the best
            services in which, at any period, a Writer can be engaged; but this service, excellent
            at all times, is especially so at the present day. For a multitude of causes unknown to
            former times are now acting with a combined force to blunt the discriminating powers of
            the mind, and unfitting it for all voluntary exertion to reduce it to a state of almost
            savage torpor. The most effective of these causes are the great national events which
            are daily taking place, and the encreasing accumulation of men in cities, where the
            uniformity of their occupations produces a craving for extraordinary incident which the
            rapid communication of intelligence hourly gratifies. To this tendency of life and
            manners the literature and theatrical exhibitions of the country have conformed
            themselves. The invaluable works of our elder writers, I had almost said the works of
            Shakespeare and Milton, are driven into neglect by frantic novels, sickly and stupid
            German Tragedies, and deluges of idle and extravagant stories in verse.—When I think
            upon this degrading thirst after outrageous stimulation I am almost ashamed to have
            spoken of the feeble effort with which I have endeavoured to counteract it; and
            reflecting upon the magnitude of the general evil, I should be oppressed with no
            dishonorable melancholy, had I not a deep impression of certain inherent and
            indestructible qualities of the human mind, and likewise of certain powers in the great
            and permanent objects that act upon it which are equally inherent and indestructible;
            and did I not further add to this impression a belief that the time is approaching when
            the evil will be systematically opposed by men of greater powers and with far more
            distinguished success. </p>

         <p>Having dwelt thus long on the subjects and aim of these Poems, I shall request the
            Reader’s permission to apprize him of a few circumstances relating to their style, in
            order, among other reasons, that I may not be censured for not having performed what I
            never attempted. Except in a very few instances the Reader will find no personifications
            of abstract ideas in these volumes, not that I mean to censure such personifications:
            they may be well fitted for certain sorts of composition, but in these Poems I propose
            to myself to imitate, and, as far as possible, to adopt the very language of men, and I
            do not find that such personifications make any regular or natural part of that
            language. I wish to keep my Reader in the company of flesh and blood, persuaded that by
            so doing I shall interest him. Not but that I believe that others who pursue a different
            track may interest him likewise: I do not interfere with their claim, I only wish to
            prefer a different claim of my own. There will also be found in these volumes little of
            what is usually called poetic diction; I have taken as much pains to avoid it as others
            ordinarily take to produce it; this I have done for the reason already alleged, to bring
            my language near to the language of men, and further, because the pleasure which I have
            proposed to myself to impart is of a kind very different from that which is supposed by
            many persons to be the proper object of poetry. I do not know how without being culpably
            particular I can give my Reader a more exact notion of the style in which I wished these
            poems to be written than by informing him that I have at all times endeavoured to look
            steadily at my subject, consequently I hope it will be found that there is in these
            Poems little falsehood of description, and that my ideas are expressed in language
            fitted to their respective importance. Something I must have gained by this practice, as
            it is friendly to one property of all good poetry, namely good sense; but it has
            necessarily cut me off from a large portion of phrases and figures of speech which from
            father to son have long been regarded as the common inheritance of Poets. I have also
            thought it expedient to restrict myself still further, having abstained from the use of
            many expressions, in themselves proper and beautiful, but which have been foolishly
            repeated by bad Poets till such feelings of disgust are connected with them as it is
            scarcely possible by any art of association to overpower. </p>

         <p>If in a Poem there should be found a series of lines, or even a single line, in which
            the language, though naturally arranged and according to the strict laws of metre, does
            not differ from that of prose, there is a numerous class of critics who, when they
            stumble upon these prosaisms as they call them, imagine that they have made a notable
            discovery, and exult over the Poet as over a man ignorant of his own profession. Now
            these men would establish a canon of criticism which the Reader will conclude he must
            utterly reject if he wishes to be pleased with these volumes. And it would be a most
            easy task to prove to him that not only the language of a large portion of every good
            poem, even of the most elevated character, must necessarily, except with reference to
            the metre, in no respect differ from that of good prose, but likewise that some of the
            most interesting parts of the best poems will be found to be strictly the language of
            prose when prose is well written. The truth of this assertion might be demonstrated by
            innumerable passages from almost all the poetical writings, even of Milton himself. I
            have not space for much quotation; but, to illustrate the subject in a general manner, I
            will here adduce a short composition of Gray, who was at the head of those who by their
            reasonings have attempted to widen the space of separation betwixt Prose and Metrical
            composition, and was more than any other man curiously elaborate in the structure of his
            own poetic diction. </p>

         <p>It will easily be perceived that the only part of this Sonnet which is of any value is
            the lines printed in Italics: it is equally obvious that except in the rhyme, and in the
            use of the single word “fruitless” for fruitlessly, which is so far a defect, the
            language of these lines does in no respect differ from that of prose. </p>

         <p>Is there then, it will be asked, no essential difference between the language of prose
            and metrical composition? I answer that there neither is nor can be any essential
            difference. We are fond of tracing the resemblance between Poetry and Painting, and,
            accordingly, we call them Sisters: but where shall we find bonds of connection
            sufficiently strict to typify the affinity betwixt metrical and prose composition? They
            both speak by and to the same organs; the bodies in which both of them are clothed may
            be said to be of the same substance, their affections are kindred and almost identical,
            not necessarily differing even in degree; Poetry <note resp="#WW" anchored="true" n="2"

               opposed to the word Prose, and synonomous with metrical composition. But much
               confusion has been introduced into criticism by this contradistinction of Poetry and
               Prose, instead of the more philosophical one of Poetry and Science. The only strict
               antithesis to Prose is Metre.]</note> sheds no tears “such as Angels weep,” but
            natural and human tears; she can boast of no celestial Ichor that distinguishes her
            vital juices from those of prose; the same human blood circulates through the veins of
            them both. </p>


         <p>If it be affirmed that rhyme and metrical arrangement of themselves constitute a
            distinction which overturns what I have been saying on the strict affinity of metrical
            language with that of prose, and paves the way for other distinctions which the mind
            voluntarily admits, I answer that the distinction of rhyme and metre is regular and
            uniform, and not, like that which is produced by what is usually called poetic diction,
            arbitrary and subject to infinite caprices upon which no calculation whatever can be
            made. In the one case the Reader is utterly at the mercy of the Poet respecting what
            imagery or diction he may choose to connect with the passion, whereas in the other the
            metre obeys certain laws, to which the Poet and Reader both willingly submit because
            they are certain, and because no interference is made by them with the passion but such
            as the concurring testimony of ages has shewn to heighten and improve the pleasure which
            co-exists with it. It will now be proper to answer an obvious question, namely, why,
            professing these opinions have I written in verse? To this in the first place I reply,
            because, however I may have restricted myself, there is still left open to me what
            confessedly constitutes the most valuable object of all writing whether in prose or
            verse, the great and universal passions of men, the most general and interesting of
            their occupations, and the entire world of nature, from which I am at liberty to supply
            myself with endless combinations of forms and imagery. Now, granting for a moment that
            whatever is interesting in these objects may be as vividly described in prose, why am I
            to be condemned if to such description I have endeavoured to superadd the charm which by
            the consent of all nations is acknowledged to exist in metrical language? To this it
            will be answered, that a very small part of the pleasure given by Poetry depends upon
            the metre, and that it is injudicious to write in metre unless it be accompanied with
            the other artificial distinctions of style with which metre is usually accompanied, and
            that by such deviation more will be lost from the shock which will be thereby given to
            the Reader’s associations than will be counterbalanced by any pleasure which he can
            derive from the general power of numbers. In answer to those who thus contend for the
            necessity of accompanying metre with certain appropriate colours of style in order to
            the accomplishment of its appropriate end, and who also, in my opinion, greatly
            under-rate the power of metre in itself, it might perhaps be almost sufficient to
            observe that poems are extant, written upon more humble subjects, and in a more naked
            and simple style than what I have aimed at, which poems have continued to give pleasure
            from generation to generation. Now, if nakedness and simplicity be a defect, the fact
            here mentioned affords a strong presumption that poems somewhat less naked and simple
            are capable of affording pleasure at the present day; and all that I am now attempting
            is to justify myself for having written under the impression of this belief. </p>

         <p>But I might point out various causes why, when the style is manly, and the subject of
            some importance, words metrically arranged will long continue to impart such a pleasure
            to mankind as he who is sensible of the extent of that pleasure will be desirous to
            impart. The end of Poetry is to produce excitement in coexistence with an overbalance of
            pleasure. Now, by the supposition, excitement is an unusual and irregular state of the
            mind; ideas and feelings do not in that state succeed each other in accustomed order.
            But if the words by which this excitement is produced are in themselves powerful, or the
            images and feelings have an undue proportion of pain connected with them, there is some
            danger that the excitement may be carried beyond its proper bounds. Now the co-presence
            of something regular, something to which the mind has been accustomed when in an
            unexcited or a less excited state, cannot but have great efficacy in tempering and
            restraining the passion by an intertexture of ordinary feeling. This may be illustrated
            by appealing to the Reader’s own experience of the reluctance with which he comes to the
            re-perusal of the distressful parts of Clarissa Harlowe, or the Gamester. While
            Shakespeare’s writings, in the most pathetic scenes, never act upon us as pathetic
            beyond the bounds of pleasure—an effect which is in a great degree to be ascribed to
            small, but continual and regular impulses of pleasurable surprise from the metrical
            arrangement.—On the other hand (what it must be allowed will much more frequently
            happen) if the Poet’s words should be incommensurate with the passion, and inadequate to
            raise the Reader to a height of desirable excitement, then, (unless the Poet’s choice of
            his metre has been grossly injudicious) in the feelings of pleasure which the Reader has
            been accustomed to connect with metre in general, and in the feeling, whether chearful
            or melancholy, which he has been accustomed to connect with that particular movement of
            metre, there will be found something which will greatly contribute to impart passion to
            the words, and to effect the complex end which the Poet proposes to himself. </p>

         <p>If I had undertaken a systematic defence of the theory upon which these poems are
            written, it would have been my duty to develope the various causes upon which the
            pleasure received from metrical language depends. Among the chief of these causes is to
            be reckoned a principle which must be well known to those who have made any of the Arts
            the object of accurate reflection; I mean the pleasure which the mind derives from the
            perception of similitude in dissimilitude. This principle is the great spring of the
            activity of our minds and their chief feeder. From this principle the direction of the
            sexual appetite, and all the passions connected with it take their origin: It is the
            life of our ordinary conversation; and upon the accuracy with which similitude in
            dissimilitude, and dissimilitude in similitude are perceived, depend our taste and our
            moral feelings. It would not have been a useless employment to have applied this
            principle to the consideration of metre, and to have shewn that metre is hence enabled
            to afford much pleasure, and to have pointed out in what manner that pleasure is
            produced. But my limits will not permit me to enter upon this subject, and I must
            content myself with a general summary. </p>

         <p> I have said that Poetry is the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings: it takes its
            origin from emotion recollected in tranquillity: the emotion is contemplated till by a
            species of reaction the tranquillity gradually disappears, and an emotion, similar to
            that which was before the subject of contemplation, is gradually produced, and does
            itself actually exist in the mind. In this mood successful composition generally begins,
            and in a mood similar to this it is carried on; but the emotion, of whatever kind and in
            whatever degree, from various causes is qualified by various pleasures, so that in
            describing any passions whatsoever, which are voluntarily described, the mind will upon
            the whole be in a state of enjoyment. Now if Nature be thus cautious in preserving in a
            state of enjoyment a being thus employed, the Poet ought to profit by the lesson thus
            held forth to him, and ought especially to take care, that whatever passions he
            communicates to his Reader, those passions, if his Reader’s mind be sound and vigorous,
            should always be accompanied with an overbalance of pleasure. Now the music of
            harmonious metrical language, the sense of difficulty overcome, and the blind
            association of pleasure which has been previously received from works of rhyme or metre
            of the same or similar construction, all these imperceptibly make up a complex feeling
            of delight, which is of the most important use in tempering the painful feeling which
            will always be found intermingled with powerful descriptions of the deeper passions.
            This effect is always produced in pathetic and impassioned poetry; while in lighter
            compositions the ease and gracefulness with which the Poet manages his numbers are
            themselves confessedly a principal source of the gratification of the Reader. I might
            perhaps include all which it is necessary to say upon this subject by affirming what few
            persons will deny, that of two descriptions either of passions, manners, or characters,
            each of them equally well executed, the one in prose and the other in verse, the verse
            will be read a hundred times where the prose is read once. We see that Pope by the power
            of verse alone, has contrived to render the plainest common sense interesting, and even
            frequently to invest it with the appearance of passion. In consequence of these
            convictions I related in metre the Tale of GOODY BLAKE and HARRY GILL, which is one of
            the rudest of this collection. I wished to draw attention to the truth that the power of
            the human imagination is sufficient to produce such changes even in our physical nature
            as might almost appear miraculous. The truth is an important one; the fact (for it is a
            fact) is a valuable illustration of it. And I have the satisfaction of knowing that it
            has been communicated to many hundreds of people who would never have heard of it, had
            it not been narrated as a Ballad, and in a more impressive metre than is usual in
            Ballads. </p>

         <p>Having thus adverted to a few of the reasons why I have written in verse, and why I have
            chosen subjects from common life, and endeavoured to bring my language near to the real
            language of men, if I have been too minute in pleading my own cause, I have at the same
            time been treating a subject of general interest; and it is for this reason that I
            request the Reader’s permission to add a few words with reference solely to these
            particular poems, and to some defects which will probably be found in them. I am
            sensible that my associations must have sometimes been particular instead of general,
            and that, consequently, giving to things a false importance, sometimes from diseased
            impulses I may have written upon unworthy subject; but I am less apprehensive on this
            account, than that my language may frequently have suffered from those arbitrary
            connections of feelings and ideas with particular words, from which no man can
            altogether protect himself. Hence I have no doubt that in some instances feelings even
            of the ludicrous may be given to my Readers by expressions which appeared to me tender
            and pathetic. Such faulty expressions, were I convinced they were faulty at present, and
            that they must necessarily continue to be so, I would willingly take all reasonable
            pains to correct. But it is dangerous to make these alterations on the simple authority
            of a few individuals, or even of certain classes of men; for where the understanding of
            an Author is not convinced, or his feelings altered, this cannot be done without great
            injury to himself: for his own feelings are his stay and support, and if he sets them
            aside in one instance, he may be induced to repeat this act till his mind loses all
            confidence in itself and becomes utterly debilitated. To this it may be added, that the
            Reader ought never to forget that he is himself exposed to the same errors as the Poet,
            and perhaps in a much greater degree: for there can be no presumption in saying that it
            is not probable he will be so well acquainted with the various stages of meaning through
            which words have passed, or with the fickleness or stability of the relations of
            particular ideas to each other; and above all, since he is so much less interested in
            the subject, he may decide lightly and carelessly. </p>

         <p>Long as I have detained my Reader, I hope he will permit me to caution him against a
            mode of false criticism which has been applied to Poetry in which the language closely
            resembles that of life and nature. Such verses have been triumphed over in parodies of
            which Dr. Johnson’s Stanza is a fair specimen. </p>

         <lg>

            <l n="15">“I put my hat upon my head, </l>

            <l n="16">And walk’d into the Strand, </l>

            <l n="17">And there I met another man </l>

            <l n="18">Whose hat was in his hand.” </l>

         </lg>

         <p>Immediately under these lines I will place one of the most justly admired stanzas of the
            “Babes in the Wood.” </p>

         <lg>

            <l n="19">“These pretty Babes with hand in hand </l>

            <l n="20">Went wandering up and down; </l>

            <l n="21">But never more they saw the Man </l>

            <l n="22">Approaching from the Town.” </l>

         </lg>

         <p>In both of these stanzas the words, and the order of the words, in no respect differ
            from the most unimpassioned conversation. There are words in both, for example, “the
            Strand,” and “the Town,” connected with none but the most familiar ideas; yet the one
            stanza we admit as admirable, and the other as a fair example of the superlatively
            contemptible. Whence arises this difference? Not from the metre, not from the language,
            not from the order of the words; but the matter expressed in Dr. Johnson’s stanza is
            contemptible. The proper method of treating trivial and simple verses to which Dr.
            Johnson’s stanza would be a fair parallelism is not to say this is a bad kind of poetry,
            or this is not poetry, but this wants sense; it is neither interesting in itself, nor
            can lead to any thing interesting; the images neither originate in that sane state of
            feeling which arises out of thought, nor can excite thought or feeling in the Reader.
            This is the only sensible manner of dealing with such verses: Why trouble yourself about
            the species till you have previously decided upon the genus? Why take pains to prove
            that an Ape is not a Newton when it is self-evident that he is not a man. </p>

         <p> I have one request to make of my Reader, which is, that in judging these Poems he would
            decide by his own feelings genuinely, and not by reflection upon what will probably be
            the judgment of others. How common is it to hear a person say, “I myself do not object
            to this style of composition or this or that expression, but to such and such classes of
            people it will appear mean or ludicrous.” This mode of criticism so destructive of all
            sound unadulterated judgment is almost universal: I have therefore to request that the
            Reader would abide independently by his own feelings, and that if he finds himself
            affected he would not suffer such conjectures to interfere with his pleasure. </p>

         <p>If an Author by any single composition has impressed us with respect for his talents, it
            is useful to consider this as affording a presumption, that, on other occasions where we
            have been displeased, he nevertheless may not have written ill or absurdly; and,
            further, to give him so much credit for this one composition as may induce us to review
            what has displeased us with more care than we should otherwise have bestowed upon it.
            This is not only an act of justice, but in our decisions upon poetry especially, may
            conduce in a high degree to the improvement of our own taste: for an accurate taste in
            Poetry and in all the other arts, as Sir Joshua Reynolds has observed, is an acquired
            talent, which can only be produced by thought and a long continued intercourse with the
            best models of composition. This is mentioned not with so ridiculous a purpose as to
            prevent the most inexperienced Reader from judging for himself, (I have already said
            that I wish him to judge for himself;) but merely to temper the rashness of decision,
            and to suggest that if Poetry be a subject on which much time has not been bestowed, the
            judgment may be erroneous, and that in many cases it necessarily will be so. </p>

         <p> I know that nothing would have so effectually contributed to further the end which I
            have in view as to have shewn of what kind the pleasure is, and how the pleasure is
            produced which is confessedly produced by metrical composition essentially different
            from what I have here endeavoured to recommend; for the Reader will say that he has been
            pleased by such composition and what can I do more for him? The power of any art is
            limited and he will suspect that if I propose to furnish him with new friends it is only
            upon condition of his abandoning his old friends. Besides, as I have said, the Reader is
            himself conscious of the pleasure which he has received from such composition,
            composition to which he has peculiarly attached the endearing name of Poetry; and all
            men feel an habitual gratitude, and something of an honorable bigotry for the objects
            which have long continued to please them: we not only wish to be pleased, but to be
            pleased in that particular way in which we have been accustomed to be pleased. There is
            a host of arguments in these feelings; and I should be the less able to combat them
            successfully, as I am willing to allow, that, in order entirely to enjoy the Poetry
            which I am recommending, it would be necessary to give up much of what is ordinarily
            enjoyed. But would my limits have permitted me to point out how this pleasure is
            produced, I might have removed many obstacles, and assisted my Reader in perceiving that
            the powers of language are not so limited as he may suppose; and that it is possible
            that poetry may give other enjoyments, of a purer, more lasting, and more exquisite
            nature. But this part of my subject I have been obliged altogether to omit: as it has
            been less my present aim to prove that the interest excited by some other kinds of
            poetry is less vivid, and less worthy of the nobler powers of the mind, than to offer
            reasons for presuming, that, if the object which I have proposed to myself were
            adequately attained, a species of poetry would be produced, which is genuine poetry; in
            its nature well adapted to interest mankind permanently, and likewise important in the
            multiplicity and quality of its moral relations. From what has been said, and from a
            perusal of the Poems, the Reader will be able clearly to perceive the object which I
            have proposed to myself: he will determine how far I have attained this object; and,
            what is a much more important question, whether it be worth attaining; and upon the
            decision of these two questions will rest my claim to the approbation of the public. </p>

            <head rend="h2">INDIAN WOMAN.</head>


            <note resp="#WW" anchored="false">[When a Northern Indian, from sickness, is unable to
               continue his journey with his companions; he is left behind, covered over with
               Deer-skins, and is supplied with water, food, and fuel if the situation of the place
               will afford it. He is informed of the track which his companions intend to pursue,
               and if he is unable to follow, or overtake them, he perishes alone in the Desart;
               unless he should have the good fortune to fall in with some other Tribes of Indians.
               It is unnecessary to add that the females are equally, or still more, exposed to the
               same fate. See that very interesting work, Hearne’s Journey from Hudson’s Bay to the
               Northern Ocean. In the high Northern Latititudes, as the same writer informs us, when
               the Northern Lights vary their position in the air, they make a rustling and a
               crackling noise. This circumstance is alluded to in the first stanza of the following
               poem.] </note>

               <l n="3"> A healthy man, a man full grown, </l>

               <l n="4">Weep in the public roads alone. </l>

               <l n="5">But such a one, on English ground, </l>

               <l n="6">And in the broad high-way, I met; </l>

               <l n="7">Along the broad high-way he came, </l>

               <l n="8">His cheeks with tears were wet. </l>

               <l n="9">Sturdy he seemed, though he was sad; </l>

               <l n="10">And in his arms a lamb he had. </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="11">He saw me, and he turned aside, </l>

               <l n="12">As if he wished himself to hide: </l>

               <l n="13">Then with his coat he made essay </l>

               <l n="14">To wipe those briny tears away. </l>

               <l n="15"> I follow’d him, and said, “My friend </l>

               <l n="16">What ails you? wherefore weep you so?” </l>

               <l n="17">—“Shame on me, Sir! this lusty lamb, </l>

               <l n="18">He makes my tears to flow. </l>

               <l n="19">To-day I fetched him from the rock; </l>

               <l n="20">He is the last of all my flock.” </l>

               <l n="21">When I was young, a single man, </l>

               <l n="22">And after youthful follies ran. </l>

               <l n="23">Though little given to care and thought, </l>

               <l n="24">Yet, so it was, a ewe I bought; </l>

               <l n="25">And other sheep from her I raised, </l>

               <l n="26">As healthy sheep as you might see, </l>

               <l n="27">And then I married, and was rich </l>

               <l n="28">As I could wish to be; </l>

               <l n="29">Of sheep I numbered a full score, </l>

               <l n="34">As sweet a flock as ever grazed! </l>

               <l n="35">Upon the mountain did they feed; </l>

               <l n="36">They throve, and we at home did thrive. </l>

               <l n="37">—This lusty lamb of all my store </l>

               <l n="38">Is all that is alive; </l>

               <l n="39">And now I care not if we die, </l>

               <l n="40">And perish all of poverty. </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="41">Six children, Sir! had I to feed, </l>

               <l n="42">Hard labour in a time of need! </l>

               <l n="43">My pride was tamed, and in our grief, </l>

               <l n="44"> I of the parish ask’d relief. </l>

               <l n="45">They said I was a wealthy man; </l>

               <l n="46">My sheep upon the mountain fed, </l>

               <l n="47">And it was fit that thence I took </l>

               <l n="49">“Do this; how can we give to you,” </l>

               <l n="50">They cried, “what to the poor is due?” </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="51"> I sold a sheep as they had said, </l>

               <l n="52">And bought my little children bread, </l>

               <l n="53">And they were healthy with their food; </l>

               <l n="54">For me it never did me good. </l>

               <l n="55"> A woeful time it was for me, </l>

               <l n="57">The pretty flock which I had reared </l>

               <l n="58">With all my care and pains, </l>

               <l n="59">To see it melt like snow away! </l>

               <l n="63">It was a vein that never stopp’d, </l>

               <l n="64">Like blood-drops from my heart they dropp’d. </l>

               <l n="65">Till thirty were not left alive </l>

               <l n="66">They dwindled, dwindled, one by one, </l>

               <l n="67">And I may say that many a time </l>

               <l n="68"> I wished they all were gone: </l>

               <l n="69">They dwindled one by one away; </l>

            <lg>

               <l n="71">To wicked deeds I was inclined, </l>

               <l n="73">And every man I chanc’d to see, </l>

               <l n="74"> I thought he knew some ill of me. </l>

               <l n="75">No peace, no comfort could I find, </l>

               <l n="77">And crazily, and wearily </l>

               <l n="78"> I went my work about. </l>

               <l n="79">Oft-times I thought to run away; </l>

               <l n="4">What if these barren boughs the bee not loves; </l>

               <l n="8">——————————————Who he was </l>

               <l n="9">That piled these stones, and with the mossy sod </l>

               <l n="10">First covered o’er and taught this aged tree </l>

               <l n="11">With its dark arms to form a circling bower, </l>

               <l n="12"> I well remember.—He was one who owned </l>

               <l n="13">No common soul. In youth by science nursed </l>

               <l n="14">And led by nature into a wild scene </l>

               <l n="15">Of lofty hopes, he to the world went forth, </l>

               <l n="16"> A favored being, knowing no desire </l>

               <l n="17">Which genius did not hallow, ’gainst the taint </l>

               <l n="18">Of dissolute tongues, and jealousy, and hate </l>

               <l n="19">And scorn, against all enemies prepared. </l>

               <l n="20">All but neglect. The world, for so it thought, </l>

               <l n="21">Owed him no service: he was like a plant </l>

               <l n="22">Fair to the sun, the darling of the winds, </l>

               <l n="23">But hung with fruit which no one, that passed by, </l>

               <l n="24">Regarded, and, his spirit damped at once, </l>

               <l n="25">With indignation did he turn away </l>

               <l n="26">And with the food of pride sustained his soul </l>

               <l n="27">In solitude.—Stranger! these gloomy boughs </l>

               <l n="28">Had charms for him; and here he loved to sit, </l>

               <l n="29">His only visitants a straggling sheep, </l>

               <l n="30">The stone-chat, or the glancing sand-piper; </l>

               <l n="31">And on these barren rocks, with juniper, </l>

               <l n="32">And heath, and thistle, thinly sprinkled o’er, </l>

               <l n="33">Fixing his downcast eye, he many an hour </l>

               <l n="34"> A morbid pleasure nourished, tracing here </l>

               <l n="35">An emblem of his own unfruitful life: </l>

               <l n="36">And lifting up his head, he then would gaze </l>

               <l n="37">On the more distant scene; how lovely ’tis </l>

               <l n="38">Thou seest, and he would gaze till it became </l>

               <l n="39">Far lovelier, and his heart could not sustain </l>

               <l n="40">The beauty still more beauteous. Nor, that time </l>

               <l n="41">When Nature had subdued him to herself </l>

               <l n="42">Would he forget those beings, to whose minds, </l>

               <l n="43">Warm from the labours of benevolence, </l>

               <l n="44">The world, and man himself, appeared a scene </l>

               <l n="45">Of kindred loveliness: then he would sigh </l>

               <l n="46">With mournful joy, to think that others felt </l>

               <l n="47">What he must never feel: and so, lost man! </l>

               <l n="48">On visionary views would fancy feed, </l>

               <l n="49">Till his eye streamed with tears. In this deep vale </l>

               <l n="50">He died, this seat his only monument. </l>

            </lg>

               <l n="53">Stranger! henceforth be warned; and know, that pride, </l>

               <l n="54">Howe’er disguised in its own majesty, </l>

               <l n="55">Is littleness; that he, who feels contempt </l>

               <l n="56">For any living thing, hath faculties </l>

               <l n="57">Which he has never used; that thought with him </l>

               <l n="59">Is ever on himself, doth look on one, </l>

               <l n="60">The least of nature’s works, one who might move </l>

               <l n="61">The wise man to that scorn which wisdom holds </l>

               <l n="62">Unlawful, ever. O, be wiser thou! </l>

               <l n="63">Instructed that true knowledge leads to love, </l>

               <l n="64">True dignity abides with him alone </l>

               <l n="65">Who, in the silent hour of inward thought, </l>

               <l n="66">Can still suspect, and still revere himself, </l>

               <l n="6">He was a woodman, and could fell and saw </l>

               <l n="9">Beneath that tree, while yet it was a tree </l>
               <l n="10">He found a baby wrapt in mosses, lined </l>
               <l n="11">With thistle beards, and such small locks of wool </l>
               <l n="12">As hang on brambles. Well, he brought him home, </l>
               <l n="13">And reared him at the then Lord Velez’ cost. </l>
               <l n="14">And so the babe grew up a pretty boy, </l>
               <l n="15"> A pretty boy, but most unteachable— </l>
               <l n="16">And never learnt a prayer, nor told a bead. </l>
               <l n="17">But knew the names of birds, and mocked their notes, </l>
               <l n="18">And whistled, as he were a bird himself: </l>
               <l n="19">And all the autumn ’twas his only play </l>
               <l n="20">To get the seeds of wild flowers, and to plant them </l>
               <l n="21">With earth and water, on the stumps of trees. </l>
               <l n="22"> A Friar, who gathered simples in the wood, </l>
               <l n="23"> A grey-haired man—he loved this little boy, </l>
               <l n="24">The boy loved him—and, when the Friar taught him, </l>
               <l n="25">He soon could write with the pen: and from that time, </l>
               <l n="26">Lived chiefly at the Convent or the Castle. </l>
               <l n="27">So he became a very learned youth. </l>
               <l n="28">But Oh! poor wretch!—he read, and read, and read, </l>
               <l n="29">Till his brain turned—and ere his twentieth year, </l>
               <l n="30">He had unlawful thoughts of many things: </l>
               <l n="31">And though he prayed, he never loved to pray </l>
               <l n="32">With holy men, nor in a holy place— </l>
               <l n="33">But yet his speech, it was so soft and sweet, </l>
               <l n="34">The late Lord Velez ne’er was wearied with him. </l>

               <l n="38">That the wall tottered, and had well-nigh fallen </l>
               <l n="39">Right on their heads. My Lord was sorely frightened; </l>
               <l n="40"> A fever seized him, and he made confession </l>
               <l n="41">Of all the heretical and lawless talk </l>
               <l n="42">Which brought this judgment: so the youth was seized </l>
               <l n="43">And cast into that cell. My husband’s father </l>
               <l n="44">Sobbed like a child—it almost broke his heart: </l>
               <l n="45">And once as he was working in the cellar, </l>
               <l n="46">He heard a voice distinctly; ’twas the youth’s </l>
               <l n="47">Who sang a doleful song about green fields, </l>
               <l n="48">How sweet it were on lake or wild savannah, </l>
               <l n="49">To hunt for food, and be a naked man, </l>
               <l n="50">And wander up and down at liberty. </l>
               <l n="51">Leoni doted on the youth, and now </l>
               <l n="52">His love grew desperate; and defying death, </l>
               <l n="53">He made that cunning entrance I described: </l>
               <l n="54">And the young man escaped. </l>
            </sp>

               <l n="58">With those bold voyagers, who made discovery </l>

               <l n="62">Soon after they arrived in that new world, </l>
               <l n="63">In spite of his dissuasion, seized a boat, </l>

            <head rend="h3">A TRUE STORY.</head>


            <lg>

               <l n="1">Oh! what’s the matter? what’s the matter? </l>

               <l n="2">What is’t that ails young Harry Gill? </l>

               <l n="3">That evermore his teeth they chatter, </l>

               <l n="4">Chatter, chatter, chatter still. </l>

               <l n="5">Of waistcoats Harry has no lack, </l>

               <l n="6">Good duffle grey, and flannel fine; </l>

               <l n="7">He has a blanket on his back, </l>

               <l n="8">And coats enough to smother nine. </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="9">In March, December, and in July, </l>

               <l n="10">’Tis all the same with Harry Gill; </l>

               <l n="11">The neighbours tell, and tell you truly, </l>

               <l n="12">His teeth they chatter, chatter still. </l>

               <l n="13">At night, at morning, and at noon, </l>

               <l n="14">’Tis all the same with Harry Gill; </l>

               <l n="15">Beneath the sun, beneath the moon, </l>

               <l n="16">His teeth they chatter, chatter still. </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="17">Young Harry was a lusty drover, </l>

               <l n="18">And who so stout of limb as he? </l>

               <l n="19">His cheeks were red as ruddy clover, </l>

               <l n="20">His voice was like the voice of three. </l>

               <l n="21">Auld Goody Blake was old and poor, </l>

               <l n="22">Ill fed she was, and thinly clad; </l>

               <l n="23">And any man who pass’d her door, </l>

               <l n="24">Might see how poor a hut she had. </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="25">All day she spun in her poor dwelling, </l>

               <l n="26">And then her three hours’ work at night! </l>

               <l n="27">Alas! ’twas hardly worth the telling, </l>

               <l n="28">It would not pay for candle-light. </l>

               <l n="29">—This woman dwelt in Dorsetshire, </l>

               <l n="30">Her hut was on a cold hill-side, </l>

               <l n="31">And in that country coals are dear, </l>

               <l n="32">For they come far by wind and tide. </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="33">By the same fire to boil their pottage, </l>

               <l n="34">Two poor old dames as I have known, </l>

               <l n="35">Will often live in one small cottage, </l>

               <l n="36">But she, poor woman, dwelt alone. </l>

               <l n="37">’Twas well enough when summer came, </l>

               <l n="38">The long, warm, lightsome summer-day, </l>

               <l n="39">Then at her door the canty dame </l>

               <l n="40">Would sit, as any linnet gay. </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="41">But when the ice our streams did fetter, </l>

               <l n="42">Oh! then how her old bones would shake! </l>

               <l n="43">You would have said, if you had met her, </l>

               <l n="44">’Twas a hard time for Goody Blake. </l>

               <l n="45">Her evenings then were dull and dead; </l>

               <l n="46">Sad case it was, as you may think, </l>

               <l n="47">For very cold to go to bed, </l>

               <l n="48">And then for cold not sleep a wink. </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="49">Oh joy for her! whene’er in winter </l>

               <l n="50">The winds at night had made a rout, </l>

               <l n="51">And scatter’d many a lusty splinter, </l>

               <l n="52">And many a rotten bough about. </l>

               <l n="53">Yet never had she, well or sick, </l>

               <l n="54">As every man who knew her says, </l>

               <l n="55"> A pile before hand, wood or stick, </l>

               <l n="56">Enough to warm her for three days. </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="57">Now when the frost was past enduring, </l>

               <l n="58">And made her poor old bones to ache, </l>

               <l n="59">Could any thing be more alluring, </l>

               <l n="60">Than an old hedge to Goody Blake? </l>

               <l n="61">And now and then, it must be said, </l>

               <l n="62">When her old bones were cold and chill, </l>

               <l n="63">She left her fire, or left her bed, </l>

               <l n="64">To seek the hedge of Harry Gill. </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="65">Now Harry he had long suspected </l>

               <l n="66">This trespass of old Goody Blake, </l>

               <l n="67">And vow’d that she should be detected, </l>

               <l n="68">And he on her would vengeance take. </l>

               <l n="69">And oft from his warm fire he’d go, </l>

               <l n="70">And to the fields his road would take, </l>

               <l n="71">And there, at night, in frost and snow, </l>

               <l n="72">He watch’d to seize old Goody Blake. </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="73">And once, behind a rick of barley, </l>

               <l n="74">Thus looking out did Harry stand; </l>

               <l n="75">The moon was full and shining clearly, </l>

               <l n="76">And crisp with frost the stubble land. </l>

               <l n="77">—He hears a noise—he’s all awake— </l>

               <l n="78">Again?—on tip-toe down the hill </l>

               <l n="79">He softly creeps—’Tis Goody Blake, </l>

               <l n="80">She’s at the hedge of Harry Gill. </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="81">Right glad was he when he beheld her; </l>

               <l n="82">Stick after stick did Goody pull, </l>

               <l n="83">He stood behind a bush of elder, </l>

               <l n="84">Till she had filled her apron full. </l>

               <l n="85">When with her load she turned about, </l>

               <l n="86">The bye-road back again to take, </l>

               <l n="87">He started forward with a shout, </l>

               <l n="88">And sprang upon poor Goody Blake. </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="89">And fiercely by the arm he took her, </l>

               <l n="90">And by the arm he held her fast, </l>

               <l n="91">And fiercely by the arm he shook her, </l>

               <l n="92">And cried, “I’ve caught you then at last!” </l>

               <l n="93">Then Goody, who had nothing said, </l>

               <l n="94">Her bundle from her lap let fall; </l>

               <l n="95">And kneeling on the sticks, she pray’d </l>

               <l n="96">To God that is the judge of all. </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="97">She pray’d, her wither’d hand uprearing, </l>

               <l n="98">While Harry held her by the arm— </l>

               <l n="99">“God! who art never out of hearing, </l>

               <l n="100"> O may he never more be warm!” </l>

               <l n="101">The cold, cold moon above her head, </l>

               <l n="102">Thus on her knees did Goody pray, </l>

               <l n="103">Young Harry heard what she had said; </l>

               <l n="104">And icy-cold he turned away. </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="105">He went complaining all the morrow </l>

               <l n="106">That he was cold and very chill: </l>

               <l n="107">His face was gloom, his heart was sorrow, </l>

               <l n="108">Alas! that day for Harry Gill! </l>

               <l n="109">That day he wore a riding-coat, </l>

               <l n="110">But not a whit the warmer he: </l>

               <l n="111">Another was on Thursday brought, </l>

               <l n="112">And ere the Sabbath he had three. </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="113">’Twas all in vain, a useless matter, </l>

               <l n="114">And blankets were about him pinn’d; </l>

               <l n="115">Yet still his jaws and teeth they clatter, </l>

               <l n="116">Like a loose casement in the wind. </l>

               <l n="117">And Harry’s flesh it fell away; </l>

               <l n="118">And all who see him say ’tis plain, </l>

               <l n="119">That, live as long as live he may, </l>

               <l n="120">He never will be warm again. </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="121">No word to any man he utters, </l>

               <l n="122"> A-bed or up, to young or old; </l>

               <l n="123">But ever to himself he mutters, </l>

               <l n="124">“Poor Harry Gill is very cold.” </l>

               <l n="125"> A-bed or up, by night or day; </l>

               <l n="126">His teeth they chatter, chatter still. </l>

               <l n="127">Now think, ye farmers all, I pray, </l>

               <l n="128">Of Goody Blake and Harry Gill. </l>

               <l n="1">There is a thorn; it looks so old, </l>

               <l n="2">In truth you’d find it hard to say, </l>

               <l n="3">How it could ever have been young, </l>

               <l n="4">It looks so old and grey. </l>

               <l n="5">Not higher than a two years’ child </l>

               <l n="6">It stands erect this aged thorn; </l>

               <l n="7">No leaves it has, no thorny points; </l>

               <l n="8">It is a mass of knotted joints, </l>

               <l n="9"> A wretched thing forlorn. </l>

               <l n="10">It stands erect, and like a stone </l>

               <l n="11">With lichens it is overgrown. </l>

            <lg>

               <head>II.</head>

               <l n="12">Like rock or stone, it is o’ergrown </l>

               <l n="13">With lichens to the very top, </l>

               <l n="14">And hung with heavy tufts of moss, </l>

               <l n="15"> A melancholy crop: </l>

               <l n="16">Up from the earth these mosses creep, </l>

               <l n="17">And this poor thorn! they clasp it round </l>

               <l n="18">So close, you’d say that they were bent </l>

               <l n="19">With plain and manifest intent, </l>

               <l n="20">To drag it to the ground; </l>

               <l n="21">And all had join’d in one endeavour </l>

               <l n="22">To bury this poor thorn for ever. </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <head>III.</head>

               <l n="23">High on a mountain’s highest ridge, </l>

               <l n="24">Where oft the stormy winter gale </l>

               <l n="25">Cuts like a scythe, while through the clouds </l>

               <l n="26">It sweeps from vale to vale; </l>

               <l n="27">Not five yards from the mountain-path, </l>

               <l n="28">This thorn you on your left espy; </l>

               <l n="29">And to the left, three yards beyond, </l>

               <l n="30">You see a little muddy pond </l>

               <l n="31">Of water, never dry; </l>

               <l n="32"> I’ve measured it from side to side: </l>

               <l n="33">’Tis three feet long, and two feet wide. </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="34">And close beside this aged thorn, </l>

               <l n="35">There is a fresh and lovely sight, </l>

               <l n="36"> A beauteous heap, a hill of moss, </l>

               <l n="37">Just half a foot in height. </l>

               <l n="38">All lovely colours there you see, </l>

               <l n="39">All colours that were ever seen, </l>

               <l n="40">And mossy network too is there, </l>

               <l n="41">As if by hand of lady fair </l>

               <l n="42">The work had woven been, </l>

               <l n="43">And cups, the darlings of the eye, </l>

               <l n="44">So deep is their vermillion dye. </l>

               <l n="45">Ah me! what lovely tints are there! </l>

               <l n="46">Of olive green and scarlet bright, </l>

               <l n="47">In spikes, in branches, and in stars, </l>

               <p>NOTE to THE THORN</p>
               <p>—This Poem ought to have been preceded by an introductory Poem, which I have been
                  prevented from writing by never having felt myself in a mood when it was probable
                  that I should write it well.—The character which I have here introduced speaking
                  is sufficiently common. The Reader will perhaps have a general notion of it, if he
                  has ever known a man, a Captain of a small trading vessel for example, who being
                  past the middle age of life, had retired upon an annuity or small independent
                  income to some village or country town of which he was not a native, or in which
                  he had not been accustomed to live. Such men having little to do become credulous
                  and talkative from indolence; and from the same cause, and other predisposing
                  causes by which it is probable that such men may have been affected, they are
                  prone to superstition. On which account it appeared to me proper to select a
                  character like this to exhibit some of the general laws by which superstition acts
                  upon the mind. Superstitious men are almost always men of slow faculties and deep
                  feelings; their minds are not loose but adhesive; they have a reasonable share of
                  imagination, by which word I mean the faculty which produces impressive effects
                  out of simple elements; but they are utterly destitute of fancy, the power by
                  which pleasure and surprize are excited by sudden varieties of situation and by
                  accumulated imagery. </p>
               <p>It was my wish in this poem to shew the manner in which such men cleave to the
                  same ideas; and to follow the turns of passion, always different, yet not palpably
                  different, by which their conversation is swayed. I had two objects to attain;
                  first, to represent a picture which should not be unimpressive yet consistent with
                  the character that should describe it, secondly, while I adhered to the style in
                  which such persons describe, to take care that words, which in their minds are
                  impregnated with passion, should likewise convey passion to Readers who are not
                  accustomed to sympathize with men feeling in that manner or using such language.
                  It seemed to me that this might be done by calling in the assistance of Lyrical
                  and rapid Metre. It was necessary that the Poem, to be natural, should in reality
                  move slowly; yet I hoped, that, by the aid of the metre, to those who should at
                  all enter into the spirit of the Poem, it would appear to move quickly. The Reader
                  will have the kindness to excuse this note as I am sensible that an introductory
                  Poem is necessary to give this Poem its full effect. </p>
               <p>Upon this occasion I will request permission to add a few words closely connected
                  with THE THORN and many other Poems in these Volumes. There is a numerous class of
                  readers who imagine that the same words cannot be repeated without tautology: this
                  is a great error: virtual tautology is much oftener produced by using different
                  words when the meaning is exactly the same. Words, a Poet’s words more
                  particularly, ought to be weighed in the balance of feeling and not measured by
                  the space which they occupy upon paper. For the Reader cannot be too often
                  reminded that Poetry is passion: it is the history or science of feelings: now
                  every man must know that an attempt is rarely made to communicate impassioned
                  feelings without something of an accompanying consciousness of the inadequateness
                  of our own powers, or the deficiencies of language. During such efforts there will
                  be a craving in the mind, and as long as it is unsatisfied the Speaker will cling
                  to the same words, or words of the same character. There are also various other
                  reasons why repetition and apparent tautology are frequently beauties of the
                  highest kind. Among the chief of these reasons is the interest which the mind
                  attaches to words, not only as symbols of the passion, but as things, active and
                  efficient, which are of themselves part of the passion. And further, from a spirit
                  of fondness, exultation, and gratitude, the mind luxuriates in the repetition of
                  words which appear successfully to communicate its feelings. The truth of these
                  remarks might be shewn by innumerable passages from the Bible and from the
                  impassioned poetry of every nation. </p>
               <p>“Awake, awake Deborah: awake, awake, utter a song:”</p>
               <p>“Arise Barak, and lead thy captivity captive, thou Son of Abinoam.”</p>
               <p>“At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay down: at her feet be bowed, he fell; where
                  he bowed there he fell down dead.” </p>
               <p>“Why is his Chariot so long in coming? Why tarry the Wheels of his
                  Chariot?”—Judges, Chap. 5th. Verses 12th, 27th, and part of 28th. </p>

            <lg>

               <l n="1"> A simple child, dear brother Jim, </l>

            <lg>

               <l n="5"> I met a little cottage girl, </l>

               <l n="7">Her hair was thick with many a curl </l>

            <lg>

               <l n="9">She had a rustic, woodland air, </l>

               <l n="15">“How many? seven in all,” she said, </l>

               <l n="16">And wondering looked at me. </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="25">“You say that two at Conway dwell, </l>

               <l n="28">Sweet Maid, how this may be?” </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="29">Then did the little Maid reply, </l>

            <lg>

               <l n="1">By Derwent’s side my Father’s cottage stood, </l>

               <l n="2">(The Woman thus her artless story told) </l>

               <l n="3">One field, a flock, and what the neighbouring flood </l>

               <l n="4">Supplied, to him were more than mines of gold. </l>

               <l n="5">Light was my sleep; my days in transport roll’d: </l>

               <l n="6">With thoughtless joy I stretch’d along the shore </l>

               <l n="7">My father’s nets, or from the mountain fold </l>

               <l n="8">Saw on the distant lake his twinkling oar </l>

               <l n="9">Or watch’d his lazy boat still less’ning more and more </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="10">My father was a good and pious man, </l>

               <l n="11">An honest man by honest parents bred, </l>

               <l n="12">And I believe that, soon as I began </l>

               <l n="13">To lisp, he made me kneel beside my bed, </l>

               <l n="14">And in his hearing there my prayers I said: </l>

               <l n="15">And afterwards, by my good father taught, </l>

               <l n="16"> I read, and loved the books in which I read; </l>

               <l n="17">For books in every neighbouring house I sought, </l>

               <l n="18">And nothing to my mind a sweeter pleasure brought. </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="19">Can I forget what charms did once adorn </l>

               <l n="20">My garden, stored with pease, and mint, and thyme, </l>

               <l n="21">And rose and lilly for the sabbath morn? </l>

               <l n="22">The sabbath bells, and their delightful chime; </l>

               <l n="23">The gambols and wild freaks at shearing time; </l>

               <l n="24">My hen’s rich nest through long grass scarce espied; </l>

               <l n="25">The cowslip-gathering at May’s dewy prime; </l>

               <l n="26">The swans, that, when I sought the water-side, </l>

               <l n="27">From far to meet me came, spreading their snowy pride. </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="28">The staff I yet remember which upbore </l>

               <l n="29">The bending body of my active sire; </l>

               <l n="30">His seat beneath the honeyed sycamore </l>

               <l n="31">When the bees hummed, and chair by winter fire; </l>

               <l n="32">When market-morning came, the neat attire </l>

               <l n="33">With which, though bent on haste, myself I deck’d; </l>

               <l n="34">My watchful dog, whose starts of furious ire, </l>

               <l n="35">When stranger passed, so often I have check’d; </l>

               <l n="36">The red-breast known for years, which at my casement peck’d. </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="37">The suns of twenty summers danced along,— </l>

               <l n="38">Ah! little marked, how fast they rolled away: </l>

               <l n="39">Then rose a stately hall our woods among, </l>

               <l n="40">And cottage after cottage owned its sway. </l>

               <l n="41">No joy to see a neighbouring house, or stray </l>

               <l n="42">Through pastures not his own, the master took; </l>

               <l n="43">My Father dared his greedy wish gainsay; </l>

               <l n="44">He loved his old hereditary nook, </l>

               <l n="45">And ill could I the thought of such sad parting brook. </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="46">But when he had refused the proffered gold, </l>

               <l n="47">To cruel injuries he became a prey, </l>

               <l n="48">Sore traversed in whate’er he bought and sold: </l>

               <l n="49">His troubles grew upon him day by day, </l>

               <l n="50">Till all his substance fell into decay. </l>

               <l n="51">His little range of water was denied; <note resp="#WW" anchored="true"

               <l n="58">That on his marriage-day sweet music made? </l>

               <l n="59">Till then he hoped his bones might there be laid, </l>

               <l n="60">Close by my mother in their native bowers: </l>

               <l n="61">Bidding me trust in God, he stood and prayed,— </l>

               <l n="62"> I could not pray:—through tears that fell in showers, </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="64">There was a youth whom I had loved so long. </l>

               <l n="65">That when I loved him not I cannot say. </l>

               <l n="66">’Mid the green mountains many and many a song </l>

               <l n="67">We two had sung, like gladsome birds in May. </l>

               <l n="68">When we began to tire of childish play </l>

               <l n="69">We seemed still more and more to prize each other; </l>

               <l n="70">We talked of marriage and our marriage day; </l>

               <l n="71">And I in truth did love him like a brother, </l>

               <l n="72">For never could I hope to meet with such another. </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="73">His father said, that to a distant town </l>

               <l n="74">He must repair, to ply the artist’s trade. </l>

               <l n="75">What tears of bitter grief till then unknown? </l>

               <l n="76">What tender vows our last sad kiss delayed! </l>

               <l n="77">To him we turned:—we had no other aid. </l>

               <l n="78">Like one revived, upon his neck I wept, </l>

               <l n="79">And her whom he had loved in joy, he said </l>

               <l n="80">He well could love in grief: his faith he kept; </l>

               <l n="81">And in a quiet home once more my father slept. </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="82">Four years each day with daily bread was blest, </l>

               <l n="83">By constant toil and constant prayer supplied. </l>

               <l n="84">Three lovely infants lay upon my breast; </l>

               <l n="85">And often, viewing their sweet smiles, I sighed, </l>

               <l n="86">And knew not why. My happy father died </l>

               <l n="87">When sad distress reduced the childrens’ meal: </l>

               <l n="88">Thrice happy! that from him the grave did hide </l>

               <l n="89">The empty loom, cold hearth, and silent wheel, </l>

               <l n="90">And tears that flowed for ills which patience could not heal. </l>

            <lg>

               <l n="91">’Twas a hard change, an evil time was come; </l>

               <l n="92">We had no hope, and no relief could gain. </l>

               <l n="93">But soon, with proud parade, the noisy drum </l>

               <l n="94">Beat round, to sweep the streets of want and pain. </l>

               <l n="95">My husband’s arms now only served to strain </l>

               <l n="96">Me and his children hungering in his view: </l>

               <l n="97">In such dismay my prayers and tears were vain: </l>

               <l n="98">To join those miserable men he flew; </l>

               <l n="99">And now to the sea-coast, with numbers more, we drew. </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="100">There foul neglect for months and months we bore, </l>

               <l n="101">Nor yet the crowded fleet its anchor stirred. </l>

               <l n="102">Green fields before us and our native shore, </l>

               <l n="103">By fever, from polluted air incurred, </l>

               <l n="104">Ravage was made, for which no knell was heard. </l>

               <l n="105">Fondly we wished, and wished away, nor knew, </l>

               <l n="106">’Mid that long sickness, and those hopes deferr’d, </l>

               <l n="107">That happier days we never more must view: </l>

               <l n="108">The parting signal streamed, at last the land withdrew. </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="109">But from delay the summer calms were past. </l>

               <l n="110">On as we drove, the equinoctial deep </l>

               <l n="111">Ran mountains-high before the howling blast. </l>

               <l n="112">We gazed with terror on the gloomy sleep </l>

               <l n="113">Of them that perished in the whirlwind’s sweep, </l>

               <l n="114">Untaught that soon such anguish must ensue, </l>

               <l n="115">Our hopes such harvest of affliction reap, </l>

               <l n="116">That we the mercy of the waves should rue. </l>

               <l n="117">We readied the western world, a poor, devoted crew. </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="118">Oh! dreadful price of being to resign </l>

               <l n="119">All that is dear in being! better far </l>

               <l n="120">In Want’s most lonely cave till death to pine, </l>

               <l n="121">Unseen, unheard, unwatched by any star; </l>

               <l n="122">Or in the streets and walks where proud men are, </l>

               <l n="123">Better our dying bodies to obtrude, </l>

               <l n="124">Than dog-like, wading at the heels of war, </l>

               <l n="125">Protract a curst existence, with the brood </l>

               <l n="126">That lap (their very nourishment!) their brother’s blood. </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="127">The pains and plagues that on our heads came down; </l>

               <l n="128">Disease and famine, agony and fear, </l>

               <l n="129">In wood or wilderness, in camp or town, </l>

               <l n="130">It would thy brain unsettle even to hear. </l>

               <l n="131">All perished—all, in one remorseless year, </l>

               <l n="132">Husband and children! one by one, by sword </l>

               <l n="133">And ravenous plague, all perished: every tear </l>

               <l n="134">Dried up, despairing, desolate, on board </l>

               <l n="135"> A British ship I waked, as from a trance restored. </l>

               <l n="141">Remote from man, and storms of mortal care, </l>

               <l n="142"> A heavenly silence did the waves invest: </l>

               <l n="158">And Murder, by the ghastly gleam, and Rape </l>

               <l n="159">Seized their joint prey, the mother and the child! </l>

               <l n="160">But from these crazing thoughts my brain, escape! </l>

               <l n="161">—For weeks the balmy air breathed soft and mild, </l>

               <l n="162">And on the gliding vessel Heaven and Ocean smiled. </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="163">Some mighty gulph of separation past, </l>

               <l n="164"> I seemed transported to another world:— </l>

               <l n="165"> A thought resigned with pain, when from the mast </l>

               <l n="166">The impatient mariner the sail unfurl’d, </l>

               <l n="167">And whistling, called the wind that hardly curled </l>

               <l n="168">The silent sea. From the sweet thoughts of home, </l>

               <l n="169">And from all hope I was forever hurled. </l>

               <l n="170">For me—farthest from earthly port to roam </l>

               <l n="171">Was best, could I but shun the spot where man might come. </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="172">And oft, robb’d of my perfect mind, I thought </l>

               <l n="173">At last my feet a resting-place had found: </l>

               <l n="174">Here will I weep in peace, (so fancy wrought,) </l>

               <l n="175">Roaming the illimitable waters round; </l>

               <l n="176">Here watch, of every human friend disowned, </l>

               <l n="177">All day, my ready tomb the ocean-flood— </l>

               <l n="178">To break my dream the vessel reached its bound: </l>

               <l n="179">And homeless near a thousand homes I stood, </l>

               <l n="180">And near a thousand tables pined, and wanted food. </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="181">By grief enfeebled was I turned adrift, </l>

               <l n="182">Helpless as sailor cast on desert rock; </l>

               <l n="183">Nor morsel to my mouth that day did lift, </l>

               <l n="184">Nor dared my hand at any door to knock. </l>

               <l n="185"> I lay, where with his drowsy mates, the cock </l>

               <l n="186">From the cross timber of an out-house hung; </l>

               <l n="187">How dismal tolled, that night, the city clock! </l>

               <l n="188">At morn my sick heart hunger scarcely stung, </l>

               <l n="189">Nor to the beggar’s language could I frame my tongue. </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="190">So passed another day, and so the third: </l>

               <l n="191">Then did I try, in vain, the crowd’s resort, </l>

               <l n="192">In deep despair by frightful wishes stirr’d, </l>

               <l n="193">Near the sea-side I reached a ruined fort: </l>

               <l n="194">There, pains which nature could no more support, </l>

               <l n="195">With blindness linked, did on my vitals fall; </l>

               <l n="196">Dizzy my brain, with interruption short </l>

               <l n="197">Of hideous sense; I sunk, nor step could crawl, </l>

               <l n="198">And thence was borne away to neighbouring hospital. </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="199">Recovery came with food: but still, my brain </l>

               <l n="200">Was weak, nor of the past had memory. </l>

               <l n="201"> I heard my neighbours, in their beds, complain </l>

               <l n="202">Of many things which never troubled me; </l>

               <l n="203">Of feet still bustling round with busy glee, </l>

               <l n="204">Of looks where common kindness had no part. </l>

               <l n="205">Of service done with careless cruelty, </l>

               <l n="206">Fretting the fever round the languid heart, </l>

               <l n="207">And groans, which, as they said, would make a dead man start. </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="208">These things just served to stir the torpid sense, </l>

               <l n="209">Nor pain nor pity in my bosom raised. </l>

               <l n="210">Memory, though slow, returned with strength: and thence </l>

               <l n="211">Dismissed, again on open day I gazed, </l>

               <l n="212">At houses, men, and common light, amazed. </l>

               <l n="213">The lanes I sought, and as the sun retired, </l>

               <l n="214">Came, where beneath the trees a faggot blazed; </l>

               <l n="215">The wild brood saw me weep, my fate enquired, </l>

               <l n="216">And gave me food, and rest, more welcome, more desired. </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="217">My heart is touched to think that men like these, </l>

               <l n="218">The rude earth’s tenants, were my first relief: </l>

               <l n="219">How kindly did they paint their vagrant ease! </l>

               <l n="220">And their long holiday that feared not grief, </l>

               <l n="221">For all belonged to all, and each was chief. </l>

               <l n="222">No plough their sinews strained; on grating road </l>

               <l n="223">No wain they drove, and yet, the yellow sheaf </l>

               <l n="224">In every vale for their delight was stowed: </l>

               <l n="225">For them, in nature’s meads, the milky udder flowed, </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="226">Semblance, with straw and panniered ass, they made </l>

               <l n="227">Of potters wandering on from door to door: </l>

               <l n="228">But life of happier sort to me pourtrayed, </l>

               <l n="229">And other joys my fancy to allure; </l>

               <l n="230">The bag-pipe dinning on the midnight moor </l>

               <l n="231">In barn uplighted, and companions boon </l>

               <l n="232">Well met from far with revelry secure, </l>

               <l n="233">In depth of forest glade, when jocund June </l>

               <l n="234">Rolled fast along the sky his warm and genial moon. </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="235">But ill it suited me, in journey dark </l>

               <l n="236"> O’er moor and mountain, midnight theft to hatch; </l>

               <l n="237">To charm the surly house-dog’s faithful bark, </l>

               <l n="238">Or hang on tiptoe at the lifted latch; </l>

               <l n="239">The gloomy lantern, and the dim blue match, </l>

               <l n="240">The black disguise, the warning whistle shrill, </l>

               <l n="241">And ear still busy on its nightly watch, </l>

               <l n="242">Were not for me, brought up in nothing ill; </l>

               <l n="243">Besides, on griefs so fresh my thoughts were brooding still. </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="244">What could I do, unaided and unblest? </l>

               <l n="245">Poor Father! gone was every friend of thine: </l>

               <l n="246">And kindred of dead husband are at best </l>

               <l n="247">Small help, and, after marriage such as mine, </l>

               <l n="248">With little kindness would to me incline. </l>

               <l n="249">Ill was I then for toil or service fit: </l>

               <l n="250">With tears whose course no effort could confine, </l>

               <l n="251">By high-way side forgetful would I sit </l>

               <l n="252">Whole hours, my idle arms in moping sorrow knit. </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="253"> I lived upon the mercy of the fields </l>

               <l n="254">And oft of cruelty the sky accused; </l>

               <l n="255">On hazard, or what general bounty yields. </l>

               <l n="256">Now coldly given, now utterly refused, </l>

               <l n="257">The fields I for my bed have often used: </l>

               <l n="258">But, what afflicts my peace with keenest ruth </l>

               <l n="259">Is, that I have my inner self abused, </l>

               <l n="260">Foregone the home delight of constant truth, </l>

               <l n="261">And clear and open soul, so prized in fearless youth. </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="262">Three years a wanderer, often have I view’d, </l>

               <l n="263">In tears, the sun towards that country tend </l>

               <l n="264">Where my poor heart lost all its fortitude: </l>

               <l n="265">And now across this moor my steps I bend— </l>

               <l n="266">Oh! tell me whither——for no earthly friend </l>

               <l n="267">Have I.——She ceased, and weeping turned away, </l>

               <l n="268">As if because her tale was at an end </l>

               <l n="269">She wept;—because she had no more to say </l>

               <l n="270">Of that perpetual weight which on her spirit lay. </l>

            <head rend="h3">With an incident in which he was concerned.</head>

            <lg>

               <l n="1">In the sweet shire of Cardigan, </l>

               <l n="2">Not far from pleasant Ivor-hall, </l>

               <l n="3">An old man dwells, a little man, </l>

               <l n="4"> I’ve heard he once was tall. </l>

               <l n="5">Of years he has upon his back, </l>

               <l n="6">No doubt, a burthen weighty; </l>

               <l n="7">He says he is three score and ten, </l>

               <l n="8">But others say he’s eighty. </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="9"> A long blue livery-coat has he, </l>

               <l n="10">That’s fair behind, and fair before; </l>

               <l n="11">Yet, meet him where you will, you see </l>

               <l n="12">At once that he is poor. </l>

               <l n="13">Full five and twenty years he lived </l>

               <l n="14"> A running huntsman merry; </l>

               <l n="15">And, though he has but one eye left, </l>

               <l n="16">His cheek is like a cherry. </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="17">No man like him the horn could sound, </l>

               <l n="18">And no man was so full of glee; </l>

               <l n="19">To say the least, four counties round. </l>

               <l n="20">Had heard of Simon Lee; </l>

               <l n="21">His master’s dead, and no one now </l>

               <l n="22">Dwells in the hall of Ivor; </l>

               <l n="23">Men, dogs, and horses, all are dead; </l>

               <l n="24">He is the sole survivor. </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="25">His hunting feats have him bereft </l>

               <l n="26">Of his right eye, as you may see: </l>

               <l n="27">And then, what limbs those feats have left </l>

               <l n="28">To poor old Simon Lee! </l>

               <l n="29">He has no son, he has no child, </l>

               <l n="30">His wife, an aged woman, </l>

               <l n="31">Lives with him, near the waterfall, </l>

               <l n="32">Upon the village common. </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="33">And he is lean and he is sick, </l>

               <l n="34">His dwindled body’s half awry, </l>

               <l n="35">His ancles they are swoln and thick; </l>

               <l n="36">His legs are thin and dry. </l>

               <l n="37">When he was young he little knew </l>

               <l n="38">’Of husbandry or tillage; </l>

               <l n="39">And now he’s forced to work, though weak, </l>

               <l n="40">—The weakest in the village. </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="41">He all the country could outrun, </l>

               <l n="42">Could leave both man and horse behind; </l>

               <l n="43">And often, ere the race was done, </l>

               <l n="44">He reeled and was stone-blind. </l>

               <l n="45">And still there’s something in the world </l>

               <l n="46">At which his heart rejoices; </l>

               <l n="47">For when the chiming bounds are out, </l>

               <l n="48">He dearly loves their voices! </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="49">Old Ruth works out of doors with him. </l>

               <l n="50">And does what Simon cannot do; </l>

               <l n="51">For she, not over stout of limb, </l>

               <l n="52">Is stouter of the two. </l>

               <l n="53">And though you with your utmost skill </l>

               <l n="54">From labour could not wean them, </l>

               <l n="55">Alas! ’tis very little, all </l>

               <l n="56">Which they can do between them. </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="1">’Tis eight o’clock,—a clear March night, </l>

               <lg>

                  <l n="2">The moon is up—the sky is blue, </l>

                  <l n="3">The owlet in the moonlight air, </l>

                  <l n="4">He shouts from nobody knows where; </l>

                  <l n="5">He lengthens out his lonely shout, </l>

                  <l n="6">Halloo! halloo! a long halloo! </l>

               </lg>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="7">—Why bustle thus about your door, </l>

               <l n="8">What means this bustle, Betty Foy? </l>

               <l n="9">Why are you in this mighty fret? </l>

               <l n="10">And why on horseback have you set </l>

               <l n="11">Him whom you love, your idiot boy? </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="12">Beneath the moon that shines so bright, </l>

               <l n="13">Till she is tired, let Betty Foy </l>

               <l n="14">With girt and stirrup fiddle-faddle; </l>

               <l n="15">But wherefore set upon a saddle </l>

               <l n="16">Him whom she loves, her idiot boy? </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="17">There’s scarce a soul that’s out of bed; </l>

               <l n="18">Good Betty put him down again; </l>

               <l n="19">His lips with joy they burr at you, </l>

               <l n="20">But, Betty! what has he to do </l>

               <l n="21">With stirrup, saddle, or with rein? </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="22">The world will say ’tis very idle, </l>

               <l n="23">Bethink you of the time of night; </l>

               <l n="24">There’s not a mother, no not one, </l>

               <l n="25">But when she hears what you have done, </l>

               <l n="26">Oh! Betty she’ll be in a fright. </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="27">But Betty’s bent on her intent, </l>

               <l n="28">For her good neighbour, Susan Gale, </l>

               <l n="29">Old Susan, she who dwells alone, </l>

               <l n="30">Is sick, and makes a piteous moan, </l>

               <l n="31">As if her very life would fail. </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="32">There’s not a house within a mile, </l>

               <l n="33">No hand to help them in distress; </l>

               <l n="34">Old Susan lies a bed in pain, </l>

               <l n="35">And sorely puzzled are the twain, </l>

               <l n="36">For what she ails they cannot guess. </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="37">And Betty’s husband’s at the wood, </l>

               <l n="38">Where by the week he doth abide, </l>

               <l n="39"> A woodman in the distant vale; </l>

               <l n="40">There’s none to help poor Susan Gale, </l>

               <l n="41">What must be done? what will betide? </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="42">And Betty from the lane has fetched </l>

               <l n="43">Her pony, that is mild and good, </l>

               <l n="44">Whether he be in joy or pain, </l>

               <l n="45">Feeding at will along the lane, </l>

               <l n="46">Or bringing faggots from the wood. </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="47">And he is all in travelling trim, </l>

               <l n="48">And by the moonlight, Betty Foy </l>

               <l n="49">Has up upon the saddle set, </l>

               <l n="50">The like was never heard of yet, </l>

               <l n="51">Him whom she loves, her idiot boy. </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="52">And he must post without delay </l>

               <l n="53">Across the bridge that’s in the dale, </l>

               <l n="54">And by the church, and o’er the down, </l>

               <l n="55">To bring a doctor from the town, </l>

               <l n="56">Or she will die, old Susan Gale. </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="57">There is no need of boot or spur, </l>

               <l n="58">There is no need of whip or wand, </l>

               <l n="59">For Johnny has his holly-bough, </l>

               <l n="60">And with a hurly-burly now </l>

               <l n="61">He shakes the green bough in his hand. </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="62">And Betty o’er and o’er has told </l>

               <l n="63">The boy who is her best delight, </l>

               <l n="64">Both what to follow, what to shun, </l>

               <l n="65">What do, and what to leave undone, </l>

               <l n="66">How turn to left, and how to right. </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="67">And Betty’s most especial charge, </l>

               <l n="68">Was, “Johnny! Johnny! mind that you </l>

               <l n="69">Come home again, nor stop at all, </l>

               <l n="70">Come home again, whate’er befal, </l>

               <l n="71">My Johnny do, I pray you do.” </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="72">To this did Johnny answer make, </l>

               <l n="73">Both with his head, and with his hand, </l>

               <l n="74">And proudly shook the bridle too, </l>

               <l n="75">And then! his words were not a few, </l>

               <l n="76">Which Betty well could understand. </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="77">And now that Johnny is just going, </l>

               <l n="78">Though Betty’s in a mighty flurry, </l>

               <l n="79">She gently pats the pony’s side, </l>

               <l n="80">On which her idiot boy must ride, </l>

               <l n="81">And seems no longer in a hurry. </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="82">But when the pony moved his legs, </l>

               <l n="83">Oh! then for the poor idiot boy! </l>

               <l n="84">For joy he cannot hold the bridle, </l>

               <l n="85">For joy his head and heels are idle, </l>

               <l n="86">He’s idle all for very joy. </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="87">And while the pony moves his legs, </l>

               <l n="88">In Johnny’s left hand you may see, </l>

               <l n="89">The green bough’s motionless and dead: </l>

               <l n="90">The moon that shines above his head </l>

               <l n="91">Is not more still and mute than he. </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="92">His heart it was so full of glee, </l>

               <l n="93">That till full fifty yards were gone, </l>

               <l n="94">He quite forgot his holly whip, </l>

               <l n="95">And all his skill in horsemanship, </l>

               <l n="96">Oh! happy, happy, happy John. </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="97">And Betty’s standing at the door, </l>

               <l n="98">And Betty’s face with joy o’erflows, </l>

               <l n="99">Proud of herself, and proud of him, </l>

               <l n="100">She sees him in his travelling trim; </l>

               <l n="101">How quietly her Johnny goes. </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="102">The silence of her idiot boy, </l>

               <l n="103">What hopes it sends to Betty’s heart! </l>

               <l n="104">He’s at the guide-post—he turns right, </l>

               <l n="105">She watches till he’s out of sight, </l>

               <l n="106">And Betty will not then depart. </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="107">Burr, burr—now Johnny’s lips they burr, </l>

               <l n="108">As loud as any mill, or near it, </l>

               <l n="109">Meek as a lamb the pony moves, </l>

               <l n="110">And Johnny makes the noise he loves, </l>

               <l n="111">And Betty listens, glad to hear it. </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="112">Away she hies to Susan Gale: </l>

               <l n="113">And Johnny’s in a merry tune, </l>

               <l n="114">The owlets hoot, the owlets purr, </l>

               <l n="115">And Johnny’s lips they burr, burr, burr, </l>

               <l n="116">And on he goes beneath the moon. </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="117">His steed and he right well agree, </l>

               <l n="118">For of this pony there’s a rumour, </l>

               <l n="119">That should he lose his eyes and ears, </l>

               <l n="120">And should he live a thousand years, </l>

               <l n="121">He never will be out of humour. </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="122">But then he is a horse that thinks! </l>

               <l n="123">And when he thinks his pace is slack; </l>

               <l n="124">Now, though he knows poor Johnny well, </l>

               <l n="125">Yet for his life he cannot tell </l>

               <l n="126">What he has got upon his back. </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="127">So through the moonlight lanes they go, </l>

               <l n="128">And far into the moonlight dale, </l>

               <l n="129">And by the church, and o’er the down, </l>

               <l n="130">To bring a doctor from the town, </l>

               <l n="131">To comfort poor old Susan Gale. </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="132">And Betty, now at Susan’s side, </l>

               <l n="133">Is in the middle of her story, </l>

               <l n="134">What comfort Johnny soon will bring, </l>

               <l n="135">With many a most diverting thing, </l>

               <l n="136">Of Johnny’s wit and Johnny’s glory. </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="137">And Betty’s still at Susan’s side: </l>

               <l n="138">By this time she’s not quite so flurried; </l>

               <l n="139">Demure with porringer and plate </l>

               <l n="140">She sits, as if in Susan’s fate </l>

               <l n="141">Her life and soul were buried. </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="142">But Betty, poor good woman! she, </l>

               <l n="143">You plainly in her face may read it, </l>

               <l n="144">Could lend out of that moment’s store </l>

               <l n="145">Five years of happiness or more, </l>

               <l n="146">To any that might need it. </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="147">But yet I guess that now and then </l>

               <l n="148">With Betty all was not so well, </l>

               <l n="149">And to the road she turns her ears, </l>

               <l n="150">And thence full many a sound she hears, </l>

               <l n="151">Which she to Susan will not tell. </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="152">Poor Susan moans, poor Susan groans, </l>

               <l n="153">“As sure as there’s a moon in heaven,” </l>

               <l n="154">Cries Betty, “he’ll be back again; </l>

               <l n="155">They’ll both be here, ’tis almost ten, </l>

               <l n="156">They’ll both be here before eleven.” </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="157">Poor Susan moans, poor Susan groans, </l>

               <l n="158">The clock gives warning for eleven; </l>

               <l n="159">’Tis on the stroke—“If Johnny’s near,” </l>

               <l n="160">Quoth Betty “he will soon be here, </l>

               <l n="161">As sure as there’s a moon in heaven.” </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="162">The clock is on the stroke of twelve, </l>

               <l n="163">And Johnny is not yet in sight, </l>

               <l n="164">The moon’s in heaven, as Betty sees, </l>

               <l n="165">But Betty is not quite at ease; </l>

               <l n="166">And Susan has a dreadful night. </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="167">And Betty, half an hour ago, </l>

               <l n="168">On Johnny vile reflections cast: </l>

               <l n="169">“A little idle sauntering thing!” </l>

               <l n="170">With other names, an endless string. </l>

               <l n="171">But now that time is gone and past. </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="172">And Betty’s drooping at the heart. </l>

               <l n="173">That happy time all past and gone, </l>

               <l n="174">“How can it be he is so late? </l>

               <l n="175">The Doctor he has made him wait, </l>

               <l n="176">Susan! they’ll both be here anon.” </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="177">And Susan’s growing worse and worse, </l>

               <l n="178">And Betty’s in a sad quandary; </l>

               <l n="179">And then there’s nobody to say </l>

               <l n="180">If she must go or she must stay: </l>

               <l n="181">—She’s in a sad quandary. </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="182">The clock is on the stroke of one; </l>

               <l n="183">But neither Doctor nor his guide </l>

               <l n="184">Appear along the moonlight road, </l>

               <l n="185">There’s neither horse nor man abroad, </l>

               <l n="186">And Betty’s still at Susan’s side. </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="187">And Susan she begins to fear </l>

               <l n="188">Of sad mischances not a few, </l>

               <l n="189">That Johnny may perhaps be drown’d, </l>

               <l n="190">Or lost perhaps, and never found; </l>

               <l n="191">Which they must both for ever rue. </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="192">She prefaced half a hint of this </l>

               <l n="193">With, “God forbid it should be true!” </l>

               <l n="194">At the first word that Susan said </l>

               <l n="195">Cried Betty, rising from the bed, </l>

               <l n="196">“Susan, I’d gladly stay with you.” </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="197">“I must be gone, I must away, </l>

               <l n="198">Consider, Johnny’s but half-wise; </l>

               <l n="199">Susan, we must take care of him, </l>

               <l n="200">If he is hurt in life or limb”— </l>

               <l n="201">“Oh God forbid!” poor Susan cries. </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="202">“What can I do?” says Betty, going, </l>

               <l n="203">“What can I do to ease your pain? </l>

               <l n="204">Good Susan tell me, and I’ll stay; </l>

               <l n="205"> I fear you’re in a dreadful way, </l>

               <l n="206">But I shall soon be back again.” </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="207">“Nay, Betty, go! good Betty, go! </l>

               <l n="208">There’s nothing that can ease my pain.” </l>

               <l n="209">Then off she hies, but with a prayer </l>

               <l n="210">That God poor Susan’s life would spare, </l>

               <l n="211">Till she comes back again. </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="212">So, through the moonlight lane she goes, </l>

               <l n="213">And far into the moonlight dale; </l>

               <l n="214">And how she ran, and how she walked, </l>

               <l n="215">And all that to herself she talked, </l>

               <l n="216">Would surely be a tedious tale. </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="217">In high and low, above, below, </l>

               <l n="218">In great and small, in round and square, </l>

               <l n="219">In tree and tower was Johnny seen, </l>

               <l n="220">In bush and brake, in black and green, </l>

               <l n="221">’Twas Johnny, Johnny, every where. </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="222">She’s past the bridge that’s in the dale, </l>

               <l n="223">And now the thought torments her sore, </l>

               <l n="224">Johnny perhaps his horse forsook, </l>

               <l n="225">To hunt the moon that’s in the brook, </l>

               <l n="226">And never will be heard of more. </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="227">And now she’s high upon the down, </l>

               <l n="228">Alone amid a prospect wide; </l>

               <l n="229">There’s neither Johnny nor his horse, </l>

               <l n="230">Among the fern or in the gorse; </l>

               <l n="231">There’s neither doctor nor his guide. </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="232">“Oh saints! what is become of him? </l>

               <l n="233">Perhaps he’s climbed into an oak, </l>

               <l n="234">Where he will stay till he is dead; </l>

               <l n="235">Or sadly he has been misled, </l>

               <l n="236">And joined the wandering gypsey-folk.” </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="237">“Or him that wicked pony’s carried </l>

               <l n="238">To the dark cave, the goblins’ hall, </l>

               <l n="239">Or in the castle he’s pursuing, </l>

               <l n="240">Among the ghosts, his own undoing; </l>

               <l n="241">Or playing with the waterfall,” </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="242">At poor old Susan then she railed, </l>

               <l n="243">While to the town she posts away; </l>

               <l n="244">“If Susan had not been so ill, </l>

               <l n="245">Alas! I should have had him still, </l>

               <l n="246">My Johnny, till my dying day.” </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="247">Poor Betty! in this sad distemper, </l>

               <l n="248">The doctor’s self would hardly spare, </l>

               <l n="249">Unworthy things she talked and wild, </l>

               <l n="250">Even he, of cattle the most mild, </l>

               <l n="251">The pony had his share. </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="252">And now she’s got into the town, </l>

               <l n="253">And to the doctor’s door she hies; </l>

               <l n="254">’Tis silence all on every side; </l>

               <l n="255">The town so long, the town so wide, </l>

               <l n="256">Is silent as the skies. </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="257">And now she’s at the doctor’s door, </l>

               <l n="258">She lifts the knocker, rap, rap, rap, </l>

               <l n="259">The doctor at the casement shews, </l>

               <l n="260">His glimmering eyes that peep and doze; </l>

               <l n="261">And one hand rubs his old night-cap. </l>

               <l n="294">The streams with softest sound are flowing, </l>

            <lg>

               <l n="307">And now she sits her down and weeps; </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="328">He with his pony now doth roam </l>

               <l n="329">The cliffs and peaks so high that are, </l>

               <l n="330">To lay his hands upon a star, </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="332">Perhaps he’s turned himself about, </l>

               <l n="420">That hobbles up the steep rough road? </l>

               <l n="424">Both for her messenger and nurse; </l>

               <l n="425">And as her mind grew worse and worse, </l>

               <l n="426">Her body it grew better. </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="427">She turned, she toss’d herself in bed, </l>

               <l n="428">On all sides doubts and terrors met her; </l>

               <l n="429">Point after point did she discuss; </l>

               <l n="430">And while her mind was fighting thus, </l>

               <l n="431">Her body still grew better. </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="432">“Alas! what is become of them? </l>

               <l n="433">These fears can never be endured, </l>

               <l n="434"> I’ll to the wood.”—The word scarce said, </l>

               <l n="435">Did Susan rise up from her bed, </l>

               <l n="436">As if by magic cured. </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="437">Away she posts up hill and down, </l>

               <l n="438">And to the wood at length is come, </l>

               <l n="439">She spies her friends, she shouts a greeting; </l>

               <l n="440">Oh me! it is a merry meeting, </l>

               <l n="441">As ever was in Christendom. </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="442">The owls have hardly sung their last, </l>

               <l n="443">While our four travellers homeward wend; </l>

               <l n="444">The owls have hooted all night long, </l>

               <l n="445">And with the owls began my song, </l>

               <l n="446">And with the owls must end. </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="447">For while they all were travelling home, </l>

               <l n="448">Cried Betty, “Tell us Johnny, do, </l>

               <l n="449">Where all this long night you have been, </l>

               <l n="450">What you have heard, what you have seen, </l>

               <l n="451">And Johnny, mind you tell us true.” </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="452">Now Johnny all night long had heard </l>

               <l n="453">The owls in tuneful concert strive; </l>

               <l n="454">No doubt too he the moon had seen; </l>

               <l n="455">For in the moonlight he had been </l>

               <l n="456">From eight o’clock till five. </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="457">And thus to Betty’s question, he, </l>

               <l n="458">Made answer, like a traveller bold, </l>

               <l n="459">(His very words I give to you,) </l>

               <l n="460">“The cocks did crow to-whoo, to-whoo, </l>

               <l n="461">And the sun did shine so cold.” </l>

               <l n="462">—Thus answered Johnny in his glory, </l>

               <l n="463">And that was all his travel’s story. </l>

               <l n="79">And every day we two will pray </l>

               <l n="80">For him that’s gone and far away. </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="81"> I’ll teach my boy the sweetest things; </l>

               <l n="82"> I’ll teach him how the owlet sings. </l>

               <l n="83">My little babe! thy lips are still, </l>

               <l n="87">Alas! alas! that look so wild, </l>

               <l n="88">It never, never came from me: </l>

               <l n="89">If thou art mad, my pretty lad, </l>

               <l n="90">Then I must be for ever sad. </l>

            </lg>

            <lg>

               <l n="91">Oh! smile on me, my little lamb! </l>

               <l n="92">For I thy own dear mother am. </l>

               <l n="93">My love for thee has well been tried: </l>

               <l n="94"> I’ve sought thy father far and wide. </l>

               <l n="95"> I know the poisons of the shade, </l>

               <l n="96"> I know the earth-nuts fit for food; </l>

               <l n="98">We’ll find thy father in the wood. </l>

               <l n="99">Now laugh and be gay, to the woods away! </l>

               <note resp="#WW" anchored="false">NOTE to the ANCIENT MARINER.—I cannot refuse myself
                  the gratification of informing such Readers as may have been pleased with this
                  Poem, or with any part of it, that they owe their pleasure in some sort to me; as
                  the Author was himself very desirous that it should be suppressed. This wish had
                  arisen from a consciousness of the defects of the Poem, and from a knowledge that
                  many persons had been much displeased with it. The Poem of my Friend has indeed
                  great defects; first, that the principal person has no distinct character, either
                  in his profession of Mariner, or as a human being who having been long under the
                  controul of supernatural impressions might be supposed himself to partake of
                  something supernatural: secondly, that he does not act, but is continually acted
                  upon: thirdly, that the events having no necessary connection do not produce each
                  other; and lastly, that the imagery is somewhat too laboriously accumulated. Yet
                  the Poem contains many delicate touches of passion, and indeed the passion is
                  every where true to nature; a great number of the stanzas present beautiful
                  images, and are expressed with unusual felicity of language; and the
                  versification, though the metre is itself unfit for long poems, is harmonious and
                  artfully varied, exhibiting the utmost powers of that metre, and every variety of
                  which it is capable. It therefore appeared to me that these several merits (the
                  first of which, namely that of the passion, is of the highest kind,) gave to the
                  Poem a value which is not often possessed by better Poems. On this account I
                  requested of my Friend to permit me to republish it. </note>

               <l n="21">Of vagrant dwellers in the houseless woods, </l>

               <l n="65">While here I stand, not only with the sense </l>

               <l n="66">Of present pleasure, but with pleasing thoughts </l>

               <l n="67">That in this moment there is life and food </l>

               <l n="68">For future years. And so I dare to hope </l>

               <l n="70"> I came among these hills; when like a roe </l>

               <l n="71"> I bounded o’er the mountains, by the sides </l>

               <l n="72">Of the deep rivers, and the lonely streams, </l>

               <l n="73">Wherever nature led: more like a man </l>

               <l n="74">Flying from something that he dreads, than one </l>

               <l n="75">Who sought the thing he loved. For nature then </l>

               <l n="78">To me was all in all.—I cannot paint </l>

               <l n="79">What then I was. The sounding cataract </l>

               <l n="80">Haunted me like a passion: the tall rock, </l>

               <l n="81">The mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood, </l>

               <l n="82">Their colours and their forms, were then to me </l>

               <l n="83">An appetite: a feeling and a love, </l>

               <l n="84">That had no need of a remoter charm, </l>

               <l n="85">By thought supplied, or any interest </l>

               <l n="86">Unborrowed from the eye.—That time is past, </l>

               <l n="87">And all its aching joys are now no more, </l>

               <l n="88">And all its dizzy raptures. Not for this </l>

               <l n="89">Faint I, nor mourn nor murmur: other gifts </l>

               <l n="90">Have followed, for such loss, I would believe </l>

               <l n="91">Abundant recompence. For I have learned </l>

               <l n="92">To look on nature, not as in the hour </l>

               <l n="93">Of thoughtless youth, but hearing oftentimes </l>

               <l n="94">The still, sad music of humanity, </l>

               <l n="95">Nor harsh nor grating, though of ample power </l>

               <l n="96">To chasten and subdue. And I have felt </l>

               <l n="97"> A presence that disturbs me with the joy </l>

               <l n="98">Of elevated thoughts; a sense sublime </l>

               <l n="99">Of something far more deeply interfused, </l>

               <l n="100">Whose dwelling is the light of setting suns, </l>
