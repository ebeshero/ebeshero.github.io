<h2>PREFACE TO THE<br>
FIRST AND SECOND EDITIONS.</h2>
<p>
<p>THE little Poems which are here called Sonnets, have, I believe, no very just claim to that title: but they consist of fourteen lines, and appear to me no improper vehicle for a single sentiment.  I am told, and I read it as the opinion of very good judges, that the legitimate Sonnet is ill calculated for our language.  The specimens Mr Hayley has given, though they form a strong exception, prove no more, than that the difficulties of the attempt vanish before uncommon powers.
<p>Some very melancholy moments have been beguiled by expressing in verse the sensations those moments brought.   Some of my friends, with partial indiscretion, have multiplied the copies they procured of several of these attempts, till they found their way into the prints of the day in a mutilated state; which, concurring with other circumstances, determined me to put them into their present form.  I can hope for readers only among the few, who, to sensibility of heart, join simplicity of taste.

<p>

<a id="piv">Page [iv]</a>
<p>
<h2>PREFACE TO THE<br>
THIRD AND FOURTH EDITIONS.</h2>
<p>
<p>THE reception given by the public, as well as my particular friends, to the two first editions of these Poems, has induced me to add to the present such other Sonnets as I have written since, or have recovered from my acquaintance, to whom I had given them without thinking well enough of them at the time to preserve any copies myself.  A few of those last written, I have attempted on the Italian model; with what success I know not; but I am persuaded that, to the generality of readers, those which are less regular will be more pleasing.
<p>As a few notes were necessary, I have added them at the end.  I have there quoted such lines as I have borrowed; and even where I am conscious the ideas were not my own, I have restored them to the original possessors.

<h2>PREFACE TO THE<br>
FIFTH EDITION.</h2>
<p>
<p>IN printing a list of so many noble, literal, and
respectable names, it would become me, perhaps,
to make my acknowledgments to those friends, to
whose exertions in my favour, rather than to any
merit of my own, I owe the brilliant assemblage.
With difficulty I repress what I feel on this subject; but in the conviction that such acknowledgments would be painful to them, I forbear publicly to speak of those particular obligations, the sense of which will ever be deeply impressed on my heart.

<h2>PREFACE TO THE<br>
SIXTH EDITION.</h2>
<p>
<p>When a sixth edition of these little Poems was
lately called for, it was proposed to me to add such
Sonnets, or other pieces, as I might have written
since the publication of the fifth.  Of these, however, I had only a few; and on showing them to a
friend, of whose judgment I had a high opinion, he
remarked that some of them, particularly "The
Sleeping Woodman," and "The Return of the
Nightingale," resembled in their subjects, and still
more in the plaintive tone in which they are written,
 the greater part of those in the former editions,
and that, perhaps, some of a more lively cast might
be better liked by the public--"<em>Toujours perdrix</em>
,"
said my friend--" '<em>Toujours perdrix</em>
,' you know,
'<em>ne vaut rien</em>
.'--I am far from supposing that
<em>your</em>
 compositions can be neglected or disapproved,
on whatever subject; but perhaps '<em>toujours rossignols, toujours des chansons tristes</em>
,' may not be so<hr>
<a id="pviii">Page viii</a>
<p>
well received as if you attempted, what you would certainly execute as successfully, a more cheerful style of composition."  "Alas!" replied I, 'Are grapes gathered from thorns, or figs from thistles?'  Or can the <em>effect</em>
 cease, while the <em>cause</em>
 remains?  <em>You know</em>
 that when in the Beech Woods of Hampshire, I first struck the chords of the melancholy lyre, its notes were never intended for the public ear!  It was unaffected sorrows drew them forth: I wrote mournfully because I was unhappy,
and I have unfortunately no reason yet, though nine years have since elapsed, to <em>change my tone</em>
.  The time is indeed arrived, when I have been promised by <em>'the honourable men'</em>
 who, <em>nine years ago</em>
, undertook to see that my family obtained the
provision their grandfather designed for them,--
that 'all should be well, all should be settled.
But still I am condemned to feel the <em>'hope delayed that maketh the heart sick.'</em>
  Still to receive--not a repetition of promises indeed--<em>but of scorn and insult</em>
, when I apply to those gentlemen, who, though they acknowledge that all impediments to a division of the estate they have undertaken to manage, are done away--will neither tell me <em>when</em>
 they will proceed to divide it, nor <em>whether they will ever do so at all</em>
.  You know the circumstances under which I have now so long been labouring; and you have done me the honour to say, that few women could so long have contended with them.  With these, however<hr>
<a id="pix">Page ix</a>
<p>
as they are some of them of a domestic and painful
nature, I will not trouble the public <em>now</em>
; but while
they exist in all their force, that indulgent public
must accept all I am able to achieve--'<em>Toujours des chansons tristes</em>
!' "
<p>Thus ended the short dialogue between my friend
and me, and I repeat it as an apology for that
apparent despondence, which, when it is observed for
a long series of years, may look like affectation.  <em>I 
shall be sorry</em>
, if on some future occasion, I should
feel myself compelled to detail its causes more at
length; for, notwithstanding I am thus frequently
appearing as an authoress, and have derived from
thence many of the greatest advantages of my life,
since it has procured me friends whose attachment
is most invaluable, I am well aware that for a woman--

<h2>PREFACE TO THE<br>
SECOND VOLUME.</h2>
<p>
<p>IT so rarely happens that a second attempt in any
species of writing equals the first, in the public
opinion, when the first has been remarkably successful; that I send this second volume of small
Poems into the world with a considerable degree of
diffidence and apprehension.
<p>Whatever inferiority may be adjudged to it, I
cannot plead want of <em>time</em>
 for its completion, if I
should attempt any excuse at all; for I do not forget that more than three years have elapsed since I
reluctantly yielded to the pressing instances of some
of my friends;<a href="#smith-note1"><font size="-2">*</font></a>
 and accepted their offers to promote a subscription to another volume of Poems--
I say, accepted the offers of my friends, because,
with a single exception, I never made any application myself.
<a id="smith-note1"></a>
<h4>* Particularly those of Joseph Cooper Walker,
Esq. of Dublin, by whose friendly and successful
applications in Ireland I am particularly obliged.</h4>
<p>
<hr>
<a id="pxii">Page xii</a>
<p>
<p>Having once before had recourse to the indulgence of the public, in publishing a book by subscription, and knowing that it had been so often
done by persons with whom it is honourable to be
ranked, it was not pride that long withheld my
consent from this manner of publication; and,
certainly, the pecuniary inconveniences I had been
exposed to for so many years, never pressed upon
me <em>more</em>
 heavily than at the moment this proposal
was urged by my friends; if then I declined it, it
was because I even at <em>that</em>
 period doubted, whether
from extreme depression of spirit, I should have
the power of fulfilling, so as to satisfy myself, the
engagement I must feel myself bound by, the moment I had accepted subscriptions.
<p>Could any one of the misfortunes that so rapidly
followed have been foreseen, nothing should have
induced me to have consented to it; for what expectation could I entertain of resisting such calamities as the detention of their property has brought on my children?  Of four sons, all seeking in other climates the competence denied them in this,
two were, for that reason, driven from their prospects in the church to the army, where one of them
was maimed during the first campaign he served
in, and is now a lieutenant of invalids. The loveliest, the most beloved of my daughters, the darling
of all her family, was torn from us for ever. The<hr>
<a id="pxiii">Page xiii</a>
<p>rest deprived of every advantage to which they are
entitled; and the means of proper education for
my youngest son denied me! while the money that
their inhuman trustees have suffered yearly to be
wasted, and what they keep possession of on false
and frivolous pretences, would, if paid to those it
belongs to, have saved me and them from all these
now irremediable misfortunes.
<p>I am well aware that the present is not a time
when the complaints of individuals against private
wrong are likely to be listened to; nor is this an
opportunity fit to make those complaints; but I
know so much has been said, so much more than
so trifling a matter could be worth, of the <em>delay</em>
 of this publication, that it becomes in some measure a
matter of self-defence, to account for that delay.
Those who have expressed such impatience for it,
were apprehensive, indeed they owned they were
of the loss of the half guinea they had paid. I have
more than once thought of returning their money,
rather than have remained under any obligation to
persons who could suspect me of a design to accumulate, by gathering subscriptions for a work I never meant to publish, a sum, which no contrivance, no success, was likely to make equal to one year of the income I ought to possess. Surely, any
who have entertained and <em>expressed</em>
 such an opinion
of me, must either never have understood, <em>or must</em>
<hr>
<a id="pxiv">Page xiv</a>
<p>
<em>have forgotten</em>
, what I was, what I am, or what I ought to be.
<p>To be suspected even by arrogant ignorance of
such an intention to impose on public generosity,
has not been the least among the mortifications I
have within these last years been subjected to; I
place them to the same long account of injuries,
where this, however, is almost lost in the magnitude of others! Let not the censors of literary
productions, or the fastidious in private life, again
reprove me for bringing forward "with querulous
egotism," the mention of myself, and the sorrows,
of which the men, who have withheld my family
property, have been the occasion. Had they never
so unjustly possessed, and so shamelessly exercised
the power of reducing me to pecuniary distress, I
should never, perhaps, have had occasion to ask
the consideration of the <em>reader</em>
, or to deprecate the
severity of the <em>critic</em>
. Certainly I should never
have been compelled to make excuses as a defaulter in point of <em>punctuality</em>
 to the <em>subscriber</em>
.  Nor should I to any of these have found it necessary to state the causes that have rendered me miserable as an <em>individual</em>
, though <em>now</em>
 I am compelled to complain of those who have crushed the poor abilities of the <em>author</em>
, and by the most unheard of acts of injustice, <em>for twice seven years</em>
, have added the painful sensations of <em>indignation</em>
 to the incon-<hr>
<a id="pxv">Page xv</a>
<p>veniences and deprivations of indigence; and aggravating by future dread, the present suffering, have frequently doubled the toil necessary for tomorrow, by palsying the hand and distracting the head, that were struggling against the evils of today!
<p>It is passed!--The injuries I have so long suffered
under are not mitigated; the aggressors are not removed: but however soon they may be disarmed of their power, any retribution in this world is impossible--they can neither give back to the maimed the possession of health, nor restore the dead. The time they have occasioned me to pass in anxiety, in
sorrow, in anguish, they cannot recall to me--to
my children they can make no amends, but they
would not if they could; nor have I the poor consolation of knowing that I leave in the callous hearts of these persons, <em>thorns</em>
 to<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"goad and sting them,"
<br>

for they have conquered or outlived all sensibility
of shame; they are alive neither to honesty, honour,
or humanity; and at this moment, far from feeling
compunction for the ruin they have occasioned,
the dreadful misfortunes they have been the authors
of, one shrinks from the very attempt to make such
redress as he might yet give, and wraps himself up<hr>
<a id="pxvi">Page xvi</a>
<p>
in the callous insolence of his imagined consequence; while the other uses such professional subterfuges as are the disgrace of his profession, to baffle me yet a little longer in my attempts to procure that restitution, that justice, which they dare
not deny I am entitled to; and to insult me by a
continuation of tormenting chicaneries, perpetuating to the utmost of their power the distresses they
have occasioned, and which their perseverance in
iniquity has already put it out of the power of
Heaven itself to remedy!
<p>Would to God I could dismiss these oppressors
from my mind forever, as I now do from the notice
of any future readers, whom I may engage to any
work of mine; though very probably I may now
take my last leave of the public. And let me,
while I account for the delay of this work, and for
many defects that may perhaps be found in it,
assign the causes for both, and lament that such
have been the circumstances under which I have
composed it, as may rather render it a wonder I
have produced it at all, than that it has been so
long in appearing, and yet appears defective.
Surely I shall be forgiven once more for "querulous egotism," when the disadvantages I have
laboured under are considered; complaint may be
pardoned when the consequences of what I deplore
mingle themselves in all my feelings, embitter<hr>
<a id="pxvii">Page xvii</a>
<p>
every hour of my life, and leave me no hope but in the oblivion of the grave.
<p>Some degree of pride which<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Still travels on, nor leaves us till we die,"
<br>
makes me somewhat solicitious to account for the visible difference in point of numbers between the subscribers to this and the former volume.  If I were willing to admit that these Poems are inferior to those that preceded them, I know that such a supposition would not have withheld a single subscription--but I also know, that as party can raise prejudices against the colour of a ribband, or the cut of a cape, it generates still stranger antipathies, even in regard so
 things almost equally trifling.  And <em>there are</em>
, who can never forgive an author that has, in the story of a Novel, or the composition of a Sonnet, ventured to hint at any opinions different from those which these liberal-minded personages are determined to find the best.
<p>I know, therefore, perfectly well, how I have sinned against some <em>ci-devant</em>
, I was going to say friends, but I check myself, and change the word for acquaintance,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"<em>Since friendship should be made of stronger stuff</em>
,"
<br>
acquaintance, who when my writing first obtained popularity, erected themselves into patrons and <hr>
<a id="pxviii">Page xviii</a>
<p>patronesses. To the favour they <em>then</em>
 conferred
I am not insensible; and I hope they will accept it as
a proof of my perfectly understanding the extent of
the obligation, that I have so silently acquiesced in
not expecting it to be repeated, and have never
suffered them to be put under the painful necessity
of avowing their dereliction in 1797, of the writer
whom they affected so warmly to patronize in 1787.  
Ten years do indeed operate most wonderful
changes in this state of existence.
<p>Perhaps in addition to the friends, or <em>
<em>soi-disant 
tel</em>
</em>
, whose notice and whose names have for some
such causes as these, been withheld, I might add
as<em> another cause</em>
, that for many months past I have
been so apprehensive of not having health enough
to superintend the publication of even this small
volume, that I had desired those few friends who
had voluntarily engaged to collect subscriptions,
not to persevere in their kind endeavours; and I
had written to my elder sons, entreating them,
should death overtake me before I could complete
my engagements, to place, as soon afterwards as
they could, in the hands of Messrs Cadell and
Davies, a sum sufficient to reimburse them any expenses they might have incurred, and to repay the
subscriptions.
<p>I am at length enabled to send it into the world--and have certainly omitted nothing that was in
my power to make it not entirely unworthy the<hr>
<a id="pxix">Page xix</a>
<p>general favour, and of the particular kindness of <em>those</em>
 without whose support I believe it would have
been impossible for me to have prepared the few
verses I had by me, or to have composed others.
That these are gloomy, none will surely have a
right to complain; for I never engaged they should
be gay.  But I am unhappily exempt from the
suspicion of <em>feigning</em>
 sorrow for an opportunity of
showing the pathos with which it can be described--a suspicion that has given rise to much ridicule,
and many invidious remarks, among certain critics
and others, who carry into their closets the same
aversion to any thing tragic, as influences, at the
present period, their theatrical taste.
<p>It is, indeed, a melancholy truth, that at this
time there is so much tragedy in real life, that
those who have escaped private calamity, can withdraw their minds a moment from that which is
general, very naturally prefer to melancholy books,
or tragic representations, those lighter and gayer
amusements, which exhilarate the senses, and
throw a transient veil over the extensive and still
threatening desolation, that overspreads this country, and in some degree, every quarter of the world.

<h2>ELEGIAC SONNETS.</h2>

<p>
<h2>SONNET I.</h2>
<p>
THE partial Muse, has from my earliest hours,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Smil'd on the rugged path I'm doom'd to tread,<br>
And still with sportive hand has snatch'd wild flowers,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To weave fantastic garlands for my head:<br>
But far, far happier is the lot of those<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Who never learn'd her dear delusive art;<br>
Which, while it decks the head with many a rose,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Reserves the thorn, to fester in the heart.<br>
For still she bids soft Pity's melting eye<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Stream o'er the ills she knows not to remove, <br>
Points every pang, and deepens every sigh<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Of mourning friendship or unhappy love.<br>
Ah! then, how dear the Muse's favours cost,<br>

<i>If those paint sorrow best--who feel it most!</i>
<br>
<p>

<p>
<h2>SONNET II.</h2>

<em>Written at the close of Spring.</em>

<p>
THE garlands fade that Spring so lately wove,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Each simple flower, which she had nursed in dew,<br>
Anemonies, that spangled every grove,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The primrose wan, and hare-bell mildly blue.<br>
No more shall violets linger in the dell,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Or purple orchis variegate the plain,<br>
Till Spring again shall call forth every bell,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And dress with humid hands her wreaths again.--<br>
Ah! poor humanity! so frail, so fair,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Are the fond visions of thy early day,<br>
Till tyrant passion and corrosive care<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Bid all thy fairy colours fade away!<br>
Another May new buds and flowers shall bring;<br>
Ah! why has happiness--no second spring?<br>

<h2>SONNET III. TO A NIGHTINGALE.</h2>
<p>
POOR, melancholy bird--that all night long<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Tell'st to the Moon thy tale of tender woe;<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;From what sad cause can such sweet sorrow flow,<br>
And whence this mournful melody of song?<br>
Thy poet's musing fancy would translate<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What mean the sounds that swell thy little breast,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;When still at dewy eve thou leav'st thy nest,<br>
Thus to the listening night to sing thy fate?<br>
Pale Sorrow's victims wert thou once among,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Though now released in woodlands wild to rove?<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Say--hast thou felt from friends some cruel wrong,<br>
Or died'st thou--martyr of disastrous love?<br>
Ah! songstress sad! that such my lot might be,<br>
To sigh and sing at Liberty--like thee!<br>
<p>

<p>
<p>
<h2>SONNET IV. TO THE MOON.</h2>
<p>
QUEEN of the silver bow!--by thy pale beam,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Alone and pensive, I delight to stray,<br>
And watch thy shadow trembling in the stream,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Or mark the floating clouds that cross thy way.<br>
And while I gaze, thy mild and placid light<br>
Sheds a soft calm upon my troubled breast;<br>
And oft I think--fair planet of the night,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That in thy orb, the wretched may have rest:<br>
The sufferers of the earth perhaps may go,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Released by death--to thy benignant sphere,<br>
And the sad children of despair and woe<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Forget in thee, their cup of sorrow here.<br>
Oh! that I soon may reach thy world serene,<br>
Poor wearied pilgrim--in this toiling scene!<br>

<h2>SONNET V. TO THE SOUTH DOWNS.</h2>
<p>
AH! hills beloved!--where once, a happy child,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Your beechen shades, 'your turf, your flowers among,'<br>
I wove your blue-bells into garlands wild,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And woke your echoes with my artless song.<br>
Ah! hills beloved!--your turf, your flowers remain;<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But can they peace to this sad breast restore,<br>
For one poor moment soothe the sense of pain,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And teach a breaking heart to throb no more?<br>
And you, Aruna!--in the vale below,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As to the sea your limpid waves you bear<br>
Can you one kind Lethean cup bestow,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To drink a long oblivion to my care?<br>
Ah! no!--when all, e'en Hope's last ray is gone,<br>
There's no oblivion--but in death alone!<br>
<p>

<p>
<p>
<h2>SONNET VI. TO HOPE.</h2>
<p>
OH, Hope! thou soother sweet of human woes.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;How shall I lure thee to my haunts forlorn?<br>
For me wilt thou renew the wither'd rose,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And clear my painful path of pointed thorn?<br>
Ah, come sweet nymph! in smiles and softness drest,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Like the young hours that lead the tender year,<br>
Enchantress, come! and charm my cares to rest:--<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Alas! the flatterer flies, and will not hear!<br>
A prey to fear, anxiety, and pain,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Must I a sad existence still deplore<br>
Lo!--the flowers fade, but all the thorns remain,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;'For me the vernal garland blooms no more.'<br>
Come then, 'pale Misery's love!' be thou my cure,<br>
And I will bless thee, who though slow art sure.<br>

<h2>SONNET VII. ON THE<br>
DEPARTURE OF THE NIGHTINGALE.</h2>
<p>
SWEET poet of the woods--a long adieu!<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Farewell, soft minstrel of the early year!<br>
Ah! 'twill be long ere thou shalt sing anew,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And pour thy music on 'the night's dull ear.'<br>
Whether on Spring thy wandering flights await,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Or whether silent in our groves you dwell,<br>
The pensive muse shall own thee for her mate,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And still protect the song she loves so well.<br>
With cautious step, the love-lorn youth shall glide<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Thro' the lone brake that shades thy mossy nest;<br>
And shepherd girls, from eyes profane shall hide<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The gentle bird, who sings of pity best:<br>
For still thy voice shall soft affections move,<br>
And still be dear to sorrow, and to love!<br>

<h2>SONNET VIII. TO SPRING.</h2>
<p>
AGAIN the wood and long-withdrawing vale<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In many a tint of tender green are drest,<br>
Where the young leaves, unfolding, scarce conceal<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Beneath their early shade, the half-form'd nest<br>
Of finch or woodlark; and the primrose pale,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And lavish cowslip, wildly scatter'd round,<br>
Give their sweet spirits to the sighing gale.<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Ah! season of delight!--could aught be found<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To soothe awhile the tortured bosom's pain,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Of sorrow's rankling shaft to cure the wound,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And bring life's first delusions once again,<br>
'Twere surely met in thee!--thy prospect fair,<br>
Thy sounds of harmony, thy balmy air,<br>
Have power to cure all sadness--but despair.<br>

BLEST is yon shepherd, on the turf reclined,<br>

Lies idly gazing--while his vacant mind<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Pours out some tale antique of rural love!<br>

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And laugh at tears themselves have forced to flow.<br>
Nor <i>his</i>

Why paint the vernal landscape green and fair,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;When life's gay dawn was opening to my view?<br>
Ah! wherefore bring those moments of delight,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;When with my Anna, on the southern shore,<br>
I thought the future, as the present bright?<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Ye dear delusions!--ye return no more!<br>
Alas! how diff'rent does the truth appear,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;From the warm picture youth's rash hand portrays!<br>
How fades the scene, as we approach it near,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And pain and sorrow strike--how many ways!<br>
Yet of that tender heart, ah! still retain<br>
A share for me--and I will not complain!<br>

<p>
COME, balmy Sleep! tired nature's soft resort!<br>

And bid gay dreams, from Morpheus' airy court,<br>

Secure of all thy blessings, partial Power!<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On his hard bed the peasant throws him down;<br>
And the poor sea-boy, in the rudest hour,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Enjoys thee more than he who wears a crown.<br>
Clasp'd in her faithful shepherd's guardian arms,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Well may the village girl sweet slumbers prove;<br>
And they, O gentle Sleep! still taste thy charms,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Who wake to labour, liberty, and love.<br>
But still thy opiate aid dost thou deny<br>
To calm the anxious breast; to close the streaming eye.<br>

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Musing, my solitary seat I take,<br>
And listen to the deep and solemn roar.<br>
<p>
<p>
O'er the dark waves the winds tempestuous howl;<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The screaming sea-bird quits the troubled sea:<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But the wild gloomy scene has charms for me,<br>
And suits the mournful temper of my soul.<br>
<p>
<p>
Already shipwreck'd by the storms of Fate,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Like the poor mariner methinks I stand,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Cast on a rock; who sees the distant land<br>
From whence no succour comes--or comes too late.<br>
Faint and more faint are heard his feeble cries,<br>
Till in the rising tide the exhausted sufferer dies.<br>

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Lives but to labour--labouring but to live.<br>
More noble than the sycophant, whose art<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Must heap with tawdry flowers thy hated shrine;<br>
I envy not the meed thou canst impart<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To crown <i>his</i>
 service--while, tho' pride combine<br>
With Fraud to crush me--my unfetter'd heart<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Still to the Mountain Nymph may offer mine.<br>

<h2>SONNET LVIII. THE GLOW-WORM.</h2>
<p>
WHEN on some balmy-breathing night of Spring<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The happy child, to whom the world is new,<br>
Pursues the evening moth, of mealy wing,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Or from the heath-bell beats the sparkling dew;<br>
He sees before his inexperienced eyes<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The brilliant Glow-worm, like a meteor, shine<br>
On the turf-bank;--amazed, and pleased, he cries,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Star of the dewy grass!--I make thee mine!"--<br>
Then, ere he sleep, collects "the moisten'd" flower,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And bids soft leaves his glittering prize enfold,<br>
And dreams that Fairy-lamps illume his bower:<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet with the morning shudders to behold<br>
His lucid treasure, rayless as the dust!<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;--So turn the world's bright joys to cold and blank disgust.<br>

<em>Written Sept.</em>
 1791, <em>during a remarkable thunder<br>

<p>
WHAT awful pageants crowd the evening sky!<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The low horizon gathering vapours shroud,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Sudden, from many a deep-embattled cloud<br>
Terrific thunders burst and lightnings fly--<br>
While in serenest azure, beaming high,<br>

<h2>ODE TO DESPAIR.FROM THE NOVEL OF EMMELINE.</h2>
<p>
THOU spectre of terrific mien!<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Lord of the hopeless heart and hollow eye,<br>
In whose fierce train each form is seen<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That drives sick Reason to insanity!<br>
I woo thee with unusual prayer,<br>
"Grim visaged, comfortless Despair:"<br>
Approach; in me a willing victim find,<br>
Who seeks thine iron sway--and calls thee kind!<br>
<p>
<p>
Ah! hide for ever from my sight<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The faithless flatterer Hope--whose pencil, gay,<br>
Portrays some vision of delight,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Then bids the fairy tablet fade away;<br>
<hr>
<a id="p31">Page 31</a>
<p>
While in dire contrast, to mine eyes,<br>
Thy phantoms, yet more hideous, rise,<br>
And Memory draws from Pleasure's wither'd flower,<br>
Corrosives for the heart--of fatal power!<br>
<p>
<p>
I bid the traitor Love adieu!<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Who to this fond believing bosom came,<br>
A guest insidious and untrue,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;With Pity's soothing voice--in Friendship's name;<br>
The wounds <i>he</i>
 gave, nor Time shall cure,<br>
Nor Reason teach me to endure.<br>
And to that breast mild Patience pleads in vain,<br>
Which feels the curse--of meriting its pain.<br>
<p>
<p>
Yet not to me, tremendous Power!<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Thy worst of spirit-wounding pangs impart,<br>
With which, in dark conviction's hour,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Thou strik'st the guilty unrepentant heart;<br>
But of illusion long the sport,<br>
That dreary, tranquil gloom I court,<br>
Where my past errors I may still deplore,<br>
And dream of long-lost happiness no more!<br>
<p>
<p>
To thee I give this tortured breast,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Where Hope arises but to foster pain;<br>
Ah! lull its agonies to rest!<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Ah! let me never be deceived again!<br>
But callous, in thy deep repose,<br>
Behold, in long array, the woes<br>
Of the dread future, calm and undismay'd,<br>
Till I may claim the hope--that shall not fade!<br>
<p>

<h2>ELEGY.</h2>
<p>
"DARK gathering clouds involve the threatening skies,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The sea heaves conscious of the impending gloom,<br>
Deep, hollow murmurs from the cliffs arise;<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;They come--the Spirits of the Tempest come!<br>

<p>
"Oh! may such terrors mark the approaching night<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As reign'd on that these streaming eyes deplore!<br>
Flash, ye red fires of heaven, with fatal light,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And with conflicting winds ye waters roar!<br>
<p>
<p>
"Loud and more loud, ye foaming billows, burst!<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Ye warring elements, more fiercely rave!<br>
Till the wide waves o'erwhelm the spot accurst<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;'Where ruthless Avarice finds a quiet grave!' "<br>
<p>
<p>
Thus with clasp'd hands, wild looks, and streaming hair,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;While shrieks of horror broke her trembling speech,<br>
A wretched maid--the victim of despair,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Survey'd the threatening storm and desert beech.<br>
<p>
<p>
Then to the tomb where now the father slept<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Whose rugged nature bade her sorrows flow,<br>
Frantic she turn'd--and beat her breast and wept,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Invoking vengeance on the dust below.<br>
<p>
<p>
"Lo! rising there above each humbler heap,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yon cypher'd stones <i>his</i>
 name and wealth relate,<br>
Who gave his son--remorseless--to the deep,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;While I, his living victim, curse my fate.<br>
<p>
<p>
"Oh, my lost love! no tomb is placed for thee,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That may to strangers' eyes thy worth impart;<br>
Thou hast no grave but in the stormy sea,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And no memorial but this breaking heart.<br>
<p>
<p>
"Forth to the world, a widow'd wanderer driven,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;I pour to winds and waves the unheeded tear,<br>
Try with vain effort to submit to Heaven,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And fruitless call on him--'who cannot hear.'<br>
<p>
<p>
"Oh! might I fondly clasp him once again,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;While o'er my head the infuriate billows pour,<br>
Forget in death this agonizing pain,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And feel his father's cruelty no more!<br>
<p>
<p>
"Part, raging waters! part, and show beneath,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In your dread caves, his pale and mangled form;<br>
Now, while the demons of despair and death<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Ride on the blast, and urge the howling storm:<br>
<p>
<hr>
<a id="p33">Page 33</a>
<p>
<p>
"Lo! by the lightning's momentary blaze,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;I see him rise the whitening waves above,<br>
No longer such as when in happier days<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He gave the enchanted hours--to me and love.<br>
<p>
<p>
"Such, as when daring the enchafed sea,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And courting dangerous toil, he often said<br>
That every peril, one soft smile from me,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One sigh of speechless tenderness o'erpaid.<br>
<p>
<p>
"But dead, disfigured, while between the roar<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Of the loud waves his accents pierce mine ear,<br>
And seem to say--Ah, wretch! delay no more,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But come, unhappy mourner--meet me here.<br>
<p>
<p>
"Yet, powerful Fancy, bid the phantom stay,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Still let me hear him!--'Tis already past;<br>
Along the waves his shadow glides away,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;I lose his voice amid the deafening blast.<br>
<p>
<p>
"Ah, wild delusion, born of frantic pain!<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He hears not, comes not from his watery bed;<br>
My tears, my anguish, my despair are vain,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The insatiate ocean gives not up its dead.<br>
<p>
<p>
" 'Tis not his voice! Hark! the deep thunders roll;<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Upheaves the ground; the rocky barriers fail;<br>
Approach, ye horrors that delight my soul,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Despair, and Death, and Desolation, hail!"<br>
<p>
<p>
The Ocean hears--The embodied waters come--<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Rise o'er the land, and with resistless sweep<br>
Tear from its base the proud aggressor's tomb,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And bear the injured to eternal sleep.<br>

<h2>SONG.</h2>
FROM THE FRENCH OF CARDINAL BERNIS.
<br>
<strong>I.</strong>
<p>
FRUIT of Aurora's tears, fair rose,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On whose soft leaves fond zephyrs play,<br>
Oh! queen of flowers, thy buds disclose,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And give thy fragrance to the day;<br>
Unveil thy transient charms:--ah, no!<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A little be thy bloom delay'd,<br>
Since the same hour that bids thee blow,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Shall see thee droop thy languid head.<br>
<p>
<br>
<strong>II.</strong>
<p>
But go! and on Themira's breast<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Find, happy flower! thy throne and tomb;<br>
While, jealous of a fate so blest,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;How shall I envy thee thy doom!<br>
Should some rude hand approach thee there,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Guard the sweet shrine thou wilt adorn;<br>
Ah! punish those who rashly dare,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And for my rivals keep thy thorn.<br>
<p>
<br>
<strong>III.</strong>
<p>
Love shall himself thy boughs compose,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And bid thy wanton leaves divide;<br>
He'll show thee how, my lovely rose,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To deck her bosom, not to hide:<br>
And thou shalt tell the cruel maid<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;How frail are youth and beauty's charms,<br>
And teach her, ere her own shall fade,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To give them to her lover's arms.<br>

<h2>THE<br>
ORIGIN OF FLATTERY.</h2>
<p>
WHEN Jove, in anger to the sons of the earth,<br>
Bid artful Vulcan give Pandora birth,<br>
And sent the fatal gift which spread below<br>
O'er all the wretched race contagious woe,<br>
Unhappy man, by vice and folly tost,<br>
Found in the storms of life his quiet lost,<br>
While Envy, Avarice, and Ambition, hurl'd<br>
Discord and death around the warring world;<br>
Then the blest peasant left his fields and fold,<br>
And barter'd love and peace for power and gold;<br>
Left his calm cottage and his native plain,<br>
In search of wealth to tempt the faithless main;<br>
Or, braving danger, in the battle stood,<br>
And bathed his savage hands in human blood;<br>
No longer then, his woodland walks among,<br>
The shepherd lad his genuine passion sung,<br>
Or sought at early morn his soul's delight,<br>
Or graved her name upon the bark at night;<br>
To deck her flowing hair no more he wove<br>
The simple wreath, or with ambitious love<br>
Bound his own brow with myrtle or with bay,<br>
But broke his pipe, or threw his crook away.<br>
The nymphs forsaken, other pleasures sought;<br>
Then first for gold their venal hearts were bought,<br>
And nature's blush to sickly art gave place,<br>
And affectation seized the seat of grace:<br>
No more simplicity by sense refined,<br>
Or generous sentiment, possess'd the mind:<br>
No more they felt each other's joy and woe,<br>
And Cupid fled, and hid his useless bow.<br>
But with deep grief propitious Venus pined,<br>
To see the ills which threaten'd womankind;<br>
Ills that she knew her empire would disarm,<br>
And rob her subjects of their sweetest charm;<br>
Good humour's potent influence destroy,<br>
And change for lowering frowns the smile of joy,<br>
Then deeply sighing at the mournful view,<br>
She tried at length what heavenly art could do<br>
<hr>
<a id="p36">Page 36</a>
<p>
To bring back Pleasure to her pensive train,<br>
And vindicate the glories of her reign.<br>
A thousand little loves attend the task,<br>
And bear from Mars's head his radiant casque,<br>
The fair enchantress on its silver bound<br>
Weaved with soft spells her magic cestus round,<br>
Then shaking from her hair ambrosial dew,<br>
Infused fair hope, and expectation new,<br>
And stifled wishes, and persuasive sighs,<br>
And fond belief, and 'eloquence of eyes,<br>
And falt'ring accents, which explain so well<br>
What studied speeches vainly try to tell;<br>
And more pathetic silence, which imparts<br>
Infectious tenderness to feeling hearts;<br>
Soft tones of pity; fascinating smiles;<br>
And Maia's son assisted her with wiles,<br>
And brought gay dreams, fantastic visions brought,<br>
And waved his wand o'er the seducing draught.<br>
Then Zephyr came: to him the goddess cried,<br>
"Go fetch from Flora all her flowery pride<br>
To fill my charm, each scented bud that blows,<br>
And bind my myrtles with her thornless rose;<br>
Then speed thy flight to Gallia's smiling plain,<br>
Where rolls the Loire, the Garonne, and the Seine;<br>
Dip in their waters thy celestial wing,<br>
And the soft dew to fill my chalice bring;<br>
But chiefly tell thy Flora, that to me<br>
She send a bouquet of her fleurs de lys;<br>
That poignant spirit will complete my spell."<br>
--'Tis done: the lovely sorceress says 'tis well.<br>
And now Apollo lends a ray of fire,<br>
The caldron bubbles, and the flames aspire;<br>
The watchful Graces round the circle dance,<br>
With arms entwined to mark the work's advance;<br>
And with full quiver sportive Cupid came,<br>
Temp'ring his favourite arrows in the flame.<br>
Then Venus speaks, the wavering flames retire,<br>
And Zephyr's breath extinguishes the fire.<br>
At length the goddess in the helmet's round<br>
A sweet and subtile spirit duly found,<br>
More soft than oil, than ether more refined,<br>
Of power to cure the woes of womankind,<br>
And call'd it Flattery:--balm of female life,<br>
It charms alike the widow, maid, and wife;<br>
Clears the sad brow of virgins in despair,<br>
And smooths the cruel traces left by care;<br>
<hr>
<a id="p37">Page 37</a>
<p>
Bids palsied age with youthful spirit glow,<br>
And hangs May's garlands on December's snow.<br>
Delicious essence! howsoe'er applied,<br>
By what rude nature is thy charm denied?<br>
Some form seducing still thy whisper wears,<br>
Stern Wisdom turns to thee her willing ears,<br>
And Prudery listens and forgets her fears.<br>
The rustic nymph whom rigid aunts restrain,<br>
Condemn'd to dress, and practise airs in vain,<br>
At thy first summons finds her bosom swell,<br>
And bids her crabbed gouvernantes farewell;<br>
While, fired by thee with spirit not her own,<br>
She grows a toast, and rises into <i>ton</i>
.<br>
The faded beauty who, with secret pain,<br>
Sees younger charms usurp her envied reign,<br>
By thee assisted, can with smiles behold<br>
The record where her conquests are enroll'd;<br>
And dwelling yet on scenes by memory nursed,<br>
When George the Second reign'd, or George the First;<br>
She sees the shades of ancient beaux arise,<br>
Who swear her eyes exceeded modern eyes,<br>
When poets sung for her, and lovers bled,<br>
And giddy fashion follow'd as she led.<br>
Departed modes appear in long array,<br>
The flowers and flounces of her happier day;<br>
Again her locks the decent fillets bind,<br>
The waving lappet flutters in the wind.<br>
And then comparing with a proud disdain<br>
The more fantastic tastes that now obtain,<br>
She deems ungraceful, trifling and absurd,<br>
The gayer world that moves round George the Third.<br>
Nor thy soft influence will the train refuse,<br>
Who court in distant shades the modest Muse,<br>
Though in a form more pure and more refined,<br>
Thy soothing spirit meets the letter'd mind.<br>
Not death itself thine empire can destroy;<br>
Tow'rds thee, even then, we turn the languid eye;<br>
Still trust in thee to bid our memory bloom,<br>
And scatter roses round the silent tomb.<br>

<h2>THE<br>
PEASANT OF THE ALPS.</h2>
FROM THE NOVEL OF CELESTINA.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;WHERE cliffs arise by winter crown'd,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And through dark groves of pine around,<br>
Down the deep chasms the snow-fed torrents foam,<br>
Within some hollow, shelter'd from the storms,<br>
The Peasant of the Alps his cottage forms,<br>
And builds his humble, happy home.<br>
<p>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Unenvied is the rich domain,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That far beneath him on the plain<br>
Waves its wide harvests and its olive groves;<br>
More dear to him his hut with plantain thatch'd,<br>
Where long his unambitious heart attach'd,<br>
Finds all he wishes, all he loves.<br>
<p>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There dwells the mistress of his heart,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And <i>Love</i>
, who teaches every art,<br>
Has bid him dress the spot with fondest care;<br>
When borrowing from the vale its fertile soil,<br>
He climbs the precipice with patient toil, <br>
To plant her favourite flowerets there.<br>
<p>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;With native shrubs, a hardy race,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There the green myrtle finds a place,<br>
And roses there the dewy leaves decline;<br>
While from the crags abrupt, and tangled steeps,<br>
With bloom and fruit the Alpine berry peeps,<br>
And, blushing, mingles with the vine.<br>
<p>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;His garden's simple produce stored,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Prepared for him by hands adored,<br>
Is all the little luxury he knows.<br>
And by the same dear hands are softly spread,<br>
The Chamois' velvet spoil that forms the bed,<br>
Where in her arms he finds repose.<br>
<p>

<a id="p39">Page 39</a>
<p>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But absent from the calm abode,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Dark thunder gathers round his road,<br>
Wild raves the wind, the arrowy lightnings flash,<br>
Returning quick the murmuring rocks among,<br>
His faint heart trembling as he winds along;<br>
Alarm'd--he listens to the crash<br>
<p>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Of rifted ice!--Oh, man of woe!<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;O'er his dear cot--a mass of snow,<br>
By the storm sever'd from the cliff above,<br>
Has fallen--and buried in its marble breast,<br>
All that for him--lost wretch--the world possest,<br>
His home, his happiness, his love!<br>

O'erwhelming anguish checks his labouring breath;<br>
Crush'd by despair's intolerable weight,<br>
Frantic he seeks the mountain's giddiest height,<br>
And headlong seeks relief in death.<br>
<p>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A fate too similar is mine,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But I--in lingering pain repine,<br>

<h2>THIRTY-EIGHT.</h2>
ADDRESSED TO MRS. H------Y.
<p>
IN early youth's unclouded scene,<br>
The brilliant morning of eighteen,<br>
With health and sprightly joy elate<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;We gazed on life's enchanting spring ,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nor thought how quickly time would bring<br>
The mournful period--Thirty-eight.<br>
<p>
<p>
Then the starch maid, or matron sage,<br>
Already at the sober age,<br>
We view'd with mingled scorn and hate;<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In whose sharp words, or sharper face,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;With thoughtless mirth we loved to trace<br>
The sad effects of--Thirty-eight.<br>
<p>
<p>
Till saddening, sickening at the view<br>
We learn'd to dread what Time might do;<br>
And then preferr'd a prayer to Fate<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To end our days ere that arrived;<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;When (power and pleasure long survived)<br>
We met neglect and--Thirty-eight.<br>
<p>
<p>
But time, in spite of wishes, flies<br>
And Fate our simple prayer denies,<br>
And bids us death's own hour await:<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The auburn locks are mix'd with grey,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The transient roses fade away,<br>
But reason comes at--Thirty-eight.<br>
<p>

<a id="p41">Page 41</a>
<p>

<h2>VERSES.</h2>
INTENDED TO HAVE BEEN PREFIXED TO THE NOVEL<br>
OF EMMELINE, BUT THEN SUPPRESSED.
<p>
O'ERWHELM'D with sorrow, and sustaining long<br>
"The proud man's contumely, th' oppressor's wrong,"<br>
Languid despondency, and vain regret,<br>
Must my exhausted spirit struggle yet?<br>
Yes!--Robb'd myself of all that fortune gave,<br>
Even of all hope--but shelter in the grave,<br>
Still shall the plaintive lyre essay its powers<br>
To dress the cave of Care with Fancy's flowers,<br>
Maternal Love the fiend Despair withstand,<br>
Still animate the heart and guide the hand.<br>
--May you, dear objects of my anxious care,<br>
Escape the evils I was born to bear!<br>
Round <i>my</i>
 devoted head while tempests roll,<br>
Yet there, where I have treasured up my soul,<br>
May the soft rays of dawning hope impart<br>
Reviving patience to my fainting heart;--<br>
And when its sharp solicitudes shall cease,<br>
May I be conscious in the realms of peace<br>
That every tear which swells my children's eyes,<br>
From sorrows past, not present ills arise,<br>
Then, with some friend who loves to share your pain,<br>
For 'tis my boast that <i>some</i>
 such friends remain,<br>
By filial grief, and fond remembrance prest,<br>
You'll seek the spot where all my sorrows rest;<br>
Recall my hapless days in sad review<br>
The long calamities I bore for you,<br>
And, with a happier fate, resolve to prove<br>
How well you merited your mother's love.<br>

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Among your silent shades of soothing hue,<br>
Your "bells and florrets of unnumber'd dyes"<br>
Might rest--And learn the bright varieties<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That from your lovely hands are fed with dew;<br>
And every veined leaf, that trembling sighs<br>
In mead or woodland; or in wilds remote,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Or lurk with mosses in the humid caves,<br>
Mantle the cliffs, on dimpling rivers float,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Or stream from coral rocks beneath the ocean's waves.<br>

DARK and conceal'd art thou, soft Evening's queen,  <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And Melancholy's votaries that delight<br>
To watch thee, gliding through the blue serene,<br>

Mild Sorrow, such as hope has not forsook,<br>

But<i> I</i>
 prefer from some steep rock to look<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On the obscure and fluctuating main,<br>
What time the martial star with lurid glare,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Portentous, gleams above the troubled deep;<br>
Or the red comet shakes his blazing hair;<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Or on the fire-ting'd waves the lightnings leap;<br>

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On thymy banks reposing, while the bees<br>
Murmur "their fairy tunes, in praise of flowers;"<br>
Or on the rock with ivy clad, and fern <br>

Of some clear current, bid his wishes turn<br>

Knows, in refined retirement, to possess<br>
By friendship hallow'd--rural happiness!<br>

Great Nature taught to "build the lofty rhyme,"<br>

Like this we live in, when the abject chime<br>

Thy noble spirit; and no longer moved<br>

Blaze on the western waters; the wide scene<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Magnificent, and tranquil, seems to spread<br>
Even o'er the rustic's breast a joy serene,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;When, like dark plague-spots by the demons shed,<br>
Charged deep with death, upon the waves, far seen,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Move the war-freighted ships; and fierce and red,<br>

In languid, hopeless sorrow, far away<br>

<p>
SWELLS then thy feeling heart, and streams thine eye<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;O'er the deserted being, poor and old,<br>
Whom cold, reluctant, parish charity<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Consigns to mingle with his kindred mould?<br>
<p>
<p>
Mourn'st thou, that <i>here</i>
 the time-worn sufferer ends<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Those evil days still threatening woes to come;<br>
Here, where the friendless feel no want of friends,<br>

Though o'er his coffin with the humid earth<br>

Rejoice, that though an outcast spurn'd by fate,<br>

In earth's cold bosom, equall'd with the great,<br>

Rejoice, that though severe his earthly doom,<br>

<h2>THE FEMALE EXILE.</h2>

<em>Written at Brighthelmstone in Nov. </em>
1792.
<p>
NOVEMBER'S chill blast on the rough beach is howling,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The surge breaks afar, and then foams to the shore,<br>
Dark clouds o'er the sea gather heavy and scowling,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And the white cliffs re-echo the wild wintry roar.<br>
<p>
<p>
Beneath that chalk rock, a fair stranger reclining,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Has found on damp sea-weed a cold lonely seat;<br>
Her eyes fill'd with tears, and her heart with repining,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;She starts at the billows that burst at her feet.<br>
<p>
<p>
There, day after day, with an anxious heart heaving,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;She watches the waves where they mingle with air;<br>
For the sail which, alas! all her fond hopes deceiving,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;May bring only tidings to add to her care.<br>
<p>
<hr>
<a id="p57">Page 57</a>
<p>
<p>
Loose stream to wild winds those fair flowing tresses,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Once woven with garlands of gay summer flowers;<br>
Her dress unregarded, bespeaks her distresses,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And beauty is blighted by grief's heavy hours.<br>
<p>
<p>
Her innocent children, unconscious of sorrow,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To seek the gloss'd shell, or the crimson weed stray;<br>
Amused with the present, they heed not to-morrow,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nor think of the storm that is gathering to-day.<br>
<p>
<p>
The gilt, fairy ship, with its ribbon sail spreading,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;They launch on the salt pool the tide left behind;<br>
Ah! victims--for whom <i>their</i>
 sad mother is dreading<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The multiplied miseries that wait on mankind!<br>
<p>
<p>
To fair fortune born, she beholds them with anguish,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Now wanderers with her on a once hostile soil,<br>
Perhaps doom'd for life in chill penury to languish,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Or abject dependence, or soul-crushing toil.<br>
<p>
<p>
But the sea-boat, her hopes and her terrors renewing,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;O'er the dim grey horizon now faintly appears;<br>
She flies to the quay, dreading tidings of ruin,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All breathless with haste, half expiring with fears.<br>
<p>
<p>
Poor mourner!--I would that my fortune had left me<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The means to alleviate the woes I deplore;<br>
But like thine my hard fate has of affluence bereft me,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<i>I</i>
 can warm the cold heart of the wretched no more!<br>

<h2>[OCCASIONAL ADDRESS.]</h2>

<em>Written for the benefit of a distressed Player, detained<br>

at Brighthelmstone for Debt, November </em>
1792.
<p>
WHEN in a thousand swarms, the summer o'er,<br>
The birds of passage quit our English shore,<br>
By various routs the feather'd myriad moves;<br>
The <i>Becca-Fica</i>
 seeks Italian groves,<br>
<hr>
<a id="p58">Page 58</a>
<p>
No more a <i>Wheat-ear</i>
; while the soaring files<br>
Of sea-fowl gather round the Hebrid isles.<br>
<p>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But if by bird-lime touch'd, unplumed, confined,<br>
Some poor ill-fated straggler stays behind,<br>
Driven from his transient perch, beneath your eaves<br>
On his unshelter'd head the tempest raves,<br>
While drooping round, redoubling every pain,<br>
His <i>mate</i>
 and nestlings ask his help in vain.<br>
<p>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So we, the buskin and the sock who wear,<br>
And "strut and fret," our little season here,<br>
Dismiss'd at length, as fortune bids divide--<br>
Some (lucky rogues!) sit down on Thames's side;<br>
Others to Liffy's western banks proceed,<br>
And some--driven far a-field, across the Tweed:<br>
But, pinion'd here, alas! I cannot fly:<br>
The <i>hapless, unplumed,</i>
 lingering straggler I!<br>
Unless the healing pity you bestow,<br>
Shall imp my shatter'd wings, and let me go.<br>
<p>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Hard is <i>his</i>
 fate, whom evil stars have led<br>
To seek in scenic art <i>precarious</i>
 bread,<br>
While still, through wild vicissitudes afloat,<br>
A hero now, and now a <i>Sans Culotte!</i>
<br>
That eleemosynary bread he gains<br>
Mingling, with real distresses, mimic pains.<br>
<p>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;See in our group, a pale, lank Falstaff stare!<br>
Much needs he stuffing:--while young Ammon there<br>
Rehearses--in a garret--ten feet square!<br>
And as his soft <i>Statira</i>
 sighs consent,<br>
Roxana comes not--but a dun for rent!<br>
Here shiv'ring Edgar, in his blanket roll'd,<br>
Exclaims--with too much reason, "<i>Tom's a-cold!</i>
"<br>
And vainly tries his sorrows to divert,<br>
While <i>Goneril</i>
 or <i>Regan</i>
--wash his shirt!<br>
<p>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Lo! fresh from Calais, Edward, mighty king!<br>
Revolves--a mutton chop upon a string!<br>
And Hotspur, plucking "honour from the moon,"<br>
Feeds a <i>sick infant</i>
 with a pewter spoon!<br>
<p>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;More bless'd the fisher, who undaunted braves<br>
In his small bark, the impetuous winds and waves;<br>
For though he plough the sea when others sleep,<br>
He draws, like Glendower, spirits from the deep.<br>
<hr>
<a id="p59">Page 59</a>
<p>
And while the storm howls round, amidst his trouble,<br>
Bright <i>moonshine</i>
 still illuminates the cobble.<br>
Pale with her fears for him, some fair <i>Poissarde</i>
,<br>
Watches his nearing boat; with fond regard<br>
Smiles when she sees his little canvass handing,<br>
And clasps her dripping lover on his landing.<br>
<p>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;More bless'd the <i>peasant</i>
, who, with nervous toil<br>
Hews the rough oak, or breaks the stubborn soil:<br>
Weary, indeed, he sees the evening come,<br>
But then, the rude, yet tranquil hut, his home,<br>
Receives its rustic inmate; then are his,<br>
Secure repose, and dear domestic bliss.<br>
The orchard's blushing fruit, the garden's store,<br>
The pendant hop, that mantles round the door,<br>
Are his:--and while cheerful faggots burn,<br>
"His lisping children hail their site's return."<br>
<p>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But wandering Players, "unhousel'd, unanneal'd,"<br>
And unappointed, scour life's common field,<br>
A flying squadron!--disappointments cross 'em,<br>
And the campaign concludes, perhaps, at Horsham.<br>
<p>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Oh! ye, whose timely bounty deigns to shed<br>
Compassion's balm upon my luckless head,<br>
Benevolence, with warm and glowing breast,<br>
And soft, celestial mercy, doubly bless'd!<br>
Smile on the generous act!--where means are given,<br>
To aid the wretched--is to merit heaven.<br>
<p>

<h2>A DESCRIPTIVE ODE,</h2>

<em>Supposed to have been written under the Ruins of<br>

Rufus's Castle, among the remains of the ancient<br>

Church on the Isle of Portland.</em>

<p>
CHAOTIC pile of barren stone,<br>
That Nature's hurrying hand has thrown,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Half finish'd, from the troubled waves;<br>
On whose rude brow the rifted tower<br>
Has frown'd, through many a stormy hour,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On this drear site of tempest-beaten graves.<br>
<p>
<p>
Sure Desolation loves to shroud<br>
His giant form within the cloud<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That hovers round thy rugged head;<br>
And as through broken vaults beneath,<br>
The future storms low-muttering breathe,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Hears the complaining voices of the dead.<br>
<p>
<p>
Here marks the fiend with eager eyes,<br>
Far out at sea the fogs arise<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That dimly shade the beacon'd strand,<br>
And listens the portentous roar<br>
Of sullen waves, as on the shore,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Monotonous, they burst and tell the storm at hand.<br>
<p>
<p>
Northward the demon's eyes are cast<br>
O'er yonder bare and sterile waste,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Where, born to hew and heave the block,<br>
Man, lost in ignorance and toil,<br>
Becomes associate to the soil,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And his heart hardens like his native rock.<br>
<p>
<hr>
<a id="p61">Page 61</a>
<p>
<p>
On the bleak hills, with flint o'erspread,<br>
No blossoms rear the purple head;<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;No shrub perfumes the zephyrs' breath,<br>
But o'er the cold and cheerless down<br>
Grim desolation seems to frown,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Blasting the ungrateful soil with partial death.<br>
<p>
<p>
Here the scathed trees with leaves half-dress'd,<br>
Shade no soft songster's secret nest,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Whose spring-notes soothe the pensive ear;<br>
But high the croaking cormorant flies,<br>
And mews and hawks with clamorous cries<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Tire the lone echoes of these caverns drear.<br>
<p>
<p>
Perchance among the ruins grey<br>
Some widow'd mourner loves to stray,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Marking the melancholy main<br>
Where once, afar she could discern<br>
O'er the white waves <i>his</i>
 sail return<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Who never, never now, returns again!<br>
<p>
<p>
On these lone tombs, by storms up-torn,<br>
The hopeless wretch may lingering mourn,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Till from the ocean, rising red,<br>
The misty moon with lurid ray<br>
Lights her, reluctant, on her way,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To steep in tears her solitary bed.<br>
<p>
<p>
Hence the dire spirit oft surveys<br>
The ship, that to the western bays<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;With favouring gales pursues its course;<br>
Then calls the vapour dark that blinds<br>
The pilot,--calls the felon winds<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That heave the billows with resistless force.<br>
<p>
<p>
Commixing with the blotted skies,<br>
High and more high the wild waves rise,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Till, as impetuous torrents urge,<br>
Driven on yon fatal bank accursed<br>
The vessel's massy timbers burst,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And the crew sinks beneath the infuriate surge.<br>
<p>
<p>
There find the weak an early grave,<br>
While youthful strength the whelming wave<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Repels; and labouring for the land,<br>
<hr>
<a id="p62">Page 62</a>
<p>
With shorten'd breath and upturn'd eyes,<br>
Sees the rough shore above him rise,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nor dreams that rapine meets him on the strand.<br>
<p>
<p>
And are there then in human form<br>
Monsters more savage than the storm,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Who from the gasping sufferer tear<br>
The dripping weed?--who dare to reap<br>
The inhuman harvest of the deep,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;From half-drown'd victims whom the tempests spare?<br>
<p>
<p>
Ah, yes! by avarice once possess'd,<br>
No pity moves the rustic breast;<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Callous he proves--as those who haply wait<br>
Till I (a pilgrim weary worn)<br>
To my own native land return,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;With legal toils to drag me to my fate!<br>

<h2>VERSES</h2>

<em>Supposed to have been written in the New Forest,<br>
in early Spring.</em>

<p>
AS in the woods, where leathery Lichen weaves<br>
Its wint'ry web among the sallow leaves,<br>
Which (through cold months in whirling eddies blown)<br>
Decay beneath the branches once their own,<br>
From the brown shelter of their foliage sear,<br>
Spring the young blooms that lead the floral year:<br>
When, waked by vernal suns, the Pilewort dares<br>
Expand her spotted leaves, and shining stars<br>
And (veins empurpling all her tassels pale)<br>
Bends the soft Wind-flower in the tepid gale;<br>
Uncultured bells of azure Jacynth's blow,<br>
And the breeze-scenting Violet lurks below:<br>
So views the wanderer, with delighted eyes,<br>
Reviving hopes from black despondence rise,<br>
When, blighted by adversity's chill breath,<br>
Those hopes had felt a temporary death;<br>
<hr>
<a id="p63">Page 63</a>
<p>
Then with gay heart he looks to future hours,<br>
When love shall dress for him the summer bowers.<br>
And, as delicious dreams enchant his mind,<br>
Forgets his sorrows past, or gives them to the wind.<br>
<p>

<h2>SONG.FROM THE FRENCH.</h2>
<br>
<strong>I.</strong>
<p>
"AH! say," the fair Louisa cried,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Say where the abode of Love is found?"<br>
Pervading nature, I replied,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;His influence spreads the world around.<br>
When Morning's arrowy beams arise,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He sparkles in the enlivening ray,<br>
And blushes in the glowing skies<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;When rosy evening fades away.<br>
<p>
<br>
<strong>II.</strong>
<p>
The summer winds that gently blow,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The flocks that bleat along the glades,<br>
The nightingale, that soft and low,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;With music fills the listening shades:<br>
The murmurs of the silver surf<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All echo Love's enchanting notes,<br>
From violets lurking in the turf,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;His balmy breath through ether floats.<br>
<p>
<br>
<strong>III.</strong>
<p>
From perfumed flowers and dewy leaves<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Delicious scents he bids exhale,<br>
He smiles amid autumnal sheaves,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And clothes with green the grassy vale;<br>
But when that throne the god assumes<br>

<h2>APOSTROPHETO AN OLD TREE.</h2>
<p>
WHERE thy broad branches brave the bitter North,<br>
Like rugged, indigent, unheeded, worth,<br>
Lo! Vegetation's guardian hands emboss<br>
Each giant limb with fronds of studded moss,<br>
That clothes the bark in many a fringed fold<br>
Begemm'd with scarlet shields, and cups of gold,<br>
Which, to the wildest winds their webs oppose,<br>
And mock the arrowy sleet, or weltering snows.<br>
--But to the warmer <i>West</i>
 the woodbine fair<br>
With tassels that perfumed the summer air,<br>
The mantling clematis, whose feathery bowers<br>
Waved in festoons with nightshade's purple flowers,<br>
The silver weed, whose corded fillets wove<br>
Round thy pale rind, even as deceitful love<br>
Of mercenary beauty would engage<br>
The dotard fondness of decrepit age;<br>
All these, that during summer's halcyon days<br>
With their green canopies conceal'd thy sprays,<br>
Are gone for ever; or disfigured, trail<br>
Their sallow relicts in the autumnal gale;<br>
Or o'er thy roots, in faded fragments toss'd,<br>
But tell of happier hours, and sweetness lost!<br>
--Thus in Fate's trying hour, when furious storms<br>
Strip social life of Pleasure's fragile forms,<br>
And awful <i>Justice</i>
, as his rightful prey<br>
Tears Luxury's silk, and jewel'd robe, away,<br>
While reads <i>Adversity</i>
 her lesson stern,<br>
And <i>Fortune's</i>
 minions tremble as they learn;<br>
The crowds around her gilded car that hung,<br>
Bent the lithe knee, and troul'd the honey'd tongue,<br>
Desponding fall, or fly in pale despair;<br>
And <i>Scorn</i>
 alone remembers that they were.<br>
Not so <i>Integrity</i>
; unchanged he lives<br>
In the rude armour conscious Honour gives,<br>
And dares with hardy front the troubled sky,<br>
In Honesty's uninjured panoply.<br>
Ne'er on Prosperity's enfeebling bed<br>
Or rosy pillows, he reposed his head,<br>
<hr>
<a id="p65">Page 65</a>
<p>
But given to useful arts, his ardent mind<br>
Has sought the general welfare of mankind;<br>
To mitigate <i>their</i>
 ills his greatest bliss,<br>
While studying <i>them</i>
, has taught him <i>what he is</i>
;<br>

<i>He</i>
, when the human tempest rages worst,<br>
And the earth shudders as the thunders burst,<br>
Firm, as thy northern branch, is rooted fast,<br>
And if he can't <i>avert</i>
, endures the blast.<br>

<h2>THE FOREST BOY.</h2>
<p>
THE trees have now hid at the edge of the hurst<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The spot where the ruins decay<br>
Of the cottage, where Will of the Woodland was nursed,<br>
And lived so beloved, till the moment accursed<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;When he went from the woodland away.<br>
<p>
<p>
Among all the lads of the plough or the fold;<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Best esteem'd by the sober and good,<br>
Was Will of the Woodlands; and often the old<br>
Would tell of his frolics, for active and bold<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Was William the boy of the wood.<br>
<p>
<p>
Yet gentle was he, as the breath of the May,     <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And when sick and declining was laid<br>
The woodman his father, young William away<br>
Would go to the forest to labour all day,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And perform his hard task in his stead.<br>
<p>
<p>
And when his poor father the forester died, <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And his mother was sad, and alone,<br>
He toil'd from the dawn, and at evening he hied<br>
In storm or in snow, or whate'er might betide,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To supply all her wants from the town.<br>
<p>
<hr>
<a id="p66">Page 66</a>
<p>
<p>
One neighbour they had on the heath to the west,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And no other the cottage was near,<br>
But she would send Phoebe, the child she loved best,<br>
To stay with the widow, thus sad and distress'd,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Her hours of dejection to cheer.<br>
<p>
<p>
As the buds of wild roses, the cheeks of the maid<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Were just tinted with youth's lovely hue,<br>
Her form, like the aspen, wild graces display'd,<br>
And the eyes, over which her luxuriant locks stray'd,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As the skies of the summer were blue.<br>
<p>
<p>
Still labouring to live, yet reflecting the while,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Young William consider'd his lot;<br>
'Twas hard, yet 'twas honest; and one tender smile<br>
From Phoebe at night overpaid ev'ry toil,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And then all his fatigues were forgot.<br>
<p>
<p>
By the brook where it glides through the copse of Arbeal,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;When to eat his cold fare he reclined,<br>
Then soft from her home his sweet Phoebe would steal,<br>
And bring him wood-strawberries to finish his meal,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And would sit by his side while he dined.<br>
<p>
<p>
And though when employed in the deep forest glade,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;His days have seem'd slowly to move,<br>
Yet Phoebe going home, through the wood-walk has stray'd<br>
To bid him good night!--and whatever she said<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Was more sweet than the voice of the dove.<br>
<p>
<p>
Fair Hope, that the lover so fondly believes,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Then repeated each soul-soothing speech,<br>
And touch'd with illusion, that often deceives<br>
The future with light; as the sun through the leaves<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Illumines the boughs of the beech.<br>
<p>
<p>
But once more the tempests of chill winter blow,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To depress and disfigure the earth;<br>
And now ere the dawn, the young woodman must go<br>
To his work in the forest, half buried in snow,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And at night bring home wood for the hearth.<br>
<p>
<hr>
<a id="p67">Page 67</a>
<p>
<p>
The bridge on the heath by the flood was wash'd down,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And fast fell the sleet and the rain,<br>
The stream to a wild rapid river was grown,<br>
And long might the widow sit sighing alone<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Ere sweet Phoebe could see her again.<br>
<p>
<p>
At the town was a market--and now for supplies,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Such as needed her humble abode,<br>
Young William went forth; and his mother with sighs<br>
Watch'd long at the window, with tears in her eyes,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Till he turn'd through the fields to the road.<br>
<p>
<p>
Then darkness came on; and she heard with affright<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The wind every moment more high;<br>
She look'd from the door; not a star lent its light,<br>
But the tempest redoubled the gloom of the night,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And the rain pour'd in sheets from the sky.<br>
<p>
<p>
The clock in her cottage now mournfully told<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The hours that went heavily on;<br>
'Twas midnight: her spirits sank hopeless and cold,<br>
And it seem'd as each blast of wind fearfully told<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That long, long would her William be gone.<br>
<p>
<p>
Then heart-sick and cold to her sad bed she crept,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet first made up the fire in the room<br>
To guide his dark steps; but she listen'd and wept,<br>
Or if for a moment forgetful she slept,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Soon she started!--and thought he was come.<br>
<p>
<p>
'Twas morn; and the wind with a hoarse sullen moan<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Now seem'd dying away in the wood,<br>
When the poor wretched mother still drooping, alone,<br>
Beheld on the threshold a figure unknown,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In gorgeous apparel who stood.<br>
<p>
<p>
"Your son is a soldier," abruptly cried he,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"And a place in our corps has obtain'd,<br>
Nay, be not cast down; you perhaps may soon see<br>
Your William a captain, he now sends by me<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The purse he already has gain'd."<br>
<p>
<hr>
<a id="p68">Page 68</a>
<p>
<p>
So William entrapp'd 'twixt persuasion and force,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Is embark'd for the isles of the West,<br>
But he seem'd to begin with ill omens his course,<br>
And felt recollection, regret, and remorse<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Continually weigh on his breast.<br>
<p>
<p>
With useless repentance he eagerly eyed<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The high coast as it faded from view,<br>
And saw the green hills, on whose northernmost side<br>
Was his own silvan home: and he falter'd, and cried,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Adieu! ah! for ever adieu!<br>
<p>
<p>
"Who now, my poor mother, thy life shall sustain,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Since thy son has thus left thee forlorn?<br>
Ah! canst thou forgive me?  And not in the pain<br>
Of this cruel desertion, of William complain,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And lament that he ever was born?<br>
<p>
<p>
"Sweet Phoebe!--if ever thy lover was dear,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Now forsake not the cottage of woe,<br>
But comfort my mother; and quiet her fear,<br>
And help her to dry up the vain fruitless tear,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That too long for my absence will flow.<br>
<p>
<p>
"Yet what if my Phoebe another should wed,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And lament her lost William no more?"<br>
The thought was too cruel; and anguish now sped<br>
The dart of disease--With the brave numerous dead<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He has fall'n on the plague-tainted shore.<br>
<p>
<p>
In the lone village church-yard, the chancel-wall near,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;High grass now waves over the spot,<br>
Where the mother of William, unable to bear<br>

<i>His</i>
 loss, who to her widow'd heart was so dear,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Has both him and her sorrows forgot.<br>
<p>
<p>
By the brook where it winds through the wood of Arbeal,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Or amid the deep forest, to moan,<br>
The poor wandering Phoebe will silently steal;<br>
The pain of her bosom no reason can heal,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And she loves to indulge it alone.<br>
<p>
<hr>
<a id="p69">Page 69</a>
<p>
<p>
Her senses are injured; her eyes dim with tears;<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;She sits by the river and weaves<br>
Reed garlands, against her dear William appears,<br>
Then breathlessly listens, and fancies she hears<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;His step in the half wither'd leaves.<br>
<p>
<p>
Ah! such are the miseries to which ye give birth,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Ye statesmen! ne'er dreading a scar;<br>
Who from pictured saloon, or the bright sculptured hearth<br>
Disperse desolation and death through the earth,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;When ye let loose the demons of war.<br>
<p>

<h2>ODE<br>

TO THE POPPY.</h2>

<em>Written by a deceased friend.</em>

<p>
NOT for the promise of the labour'd field,<br>
Not for the good the yellow harvests yield,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;I bend at Ceres' shrine;<br>
For dull, to human eyes, appear<br>
The golden glories of the year,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Alas!--a melancholy worship's mine,<br>
<p>
<p>
I hail the goddess for her scarlet flower;<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Thou brilliant weed,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That dost so far exceed<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The richest gifts gay Flora can bestow:<br>
Heedless I pass'd thee, in life's morning hour,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;(Thou comforter of woe)<br>
Till sorrow taught me to confess thy power.<br>
<p>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In early days, when Fancy cheats,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A varied wreath I wove,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Of laughing Spring's luxuriant sweets,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To deck ungrateful Love:<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The rose, or thorn, my labours crown'd;<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As Venus smiled, or Venus frown'd;<br>

<a id="p70">Page 70</a>
<p>
<p>
But Love and Joy, and all their train, are flown;<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;E'en languid Hope no more is mine,<br>
And I will sing of thee alone,<br>
Unless, perchance, the attributes of Grief,<br>
The cypress bud, and willow leaf,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Their pale funereal foliage blend with thine.<br>
<p>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Hail, lovely blossom!--thou canst ease<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The wretched victims of Disease;<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Canst close those weary eyes in gentle sleep,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Which never open but to weep;<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For, oh! thy potent charm<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Can agonizing Pain disarm;<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Expel imperious Memory from her seat,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And bid the throbbing heart forget to beat.<br>
<p>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Soul-soothing plant! that can such blessings give,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;By thee the mourner bears to live!<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;By thee the hopeless die!<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Oh! ever "friendly to despair,"<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Might Sorrow's pallid votary dare,<br>
Without a crime, that remedy implore,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Which bids the spirit from its bondage fly,<br>
I'd court thy palliative aid no more;<br>
<p>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;No more I'd sue that thou shouldst spread,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Thy spell around my aching head,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But would conjure thee to impart<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Thy balsam for a broken heart;<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And by thy soft Lethean power,<br>

<h2>[VERSES]</h2>

<em>Written by the same lady on seeing her two sons<br>
at play.</em>

<p>
SWEET age of bless'd delusion! blooming boys,<br>
Ah! revel long in childhood's thoughtless joys,<br>
With light and pliant spirits, that can stoop<br>
To follow, sportively, the rolling hoop;<br>
<hr>
<a id="p71">Page 71</a>
<p>
To watch the sleeping top with gay delight,<br>
Or mark, with raptured gaze, the sailing kite;<br>
Or, eagerly pursuing Pleasure's call,<br>
Can find it center'd in the bounding ball.<br>
Alas! the day <i>will</i>
 come, when sports like these<br>
Must lose their magic, and their power to please:<br>
Too swiftly fled, the rosy hours of youth<br>
Shall yield their fairy charms to mournful Truth;<br>
Even now, a mother's fond prophetic fear<br>
Sees the dark train of human ills appear;<br>
Views various fortune for each lovely child,<br>
Storms for the bold, and anguish for the mild;<br>
Beholds already those expressive eyes<br>
Beam a sad certainty of future sighs;<br>
And dreads each suffering those dear breasts may know<br>
In their long passage through a world of woe;<br>
Perchance predestined every pang to prove,<br>
That treacherous friends inflict, or faithless love;<br>
For, ah! how few have found existence sweet,<br>
Where grief is sure, but happiness deceit.<br>

<p>
LIKE a poor ghost the night I seek;<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Its hollow winds repeat my sighs;<br>
The cold dews mingle on my cheek<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;With tears that wander from mine eyes.<br>
<p>
<p>
The thorns that still my couch molest,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Have robb'd these heavy eyes of sleep;<br>
But though deprived of tranquil rest,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;I here at last am free to weep.<br>
<p>
<p>
Twelve times the moon, that rises red<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;O'er yon tall wood of shadowy pine,<br>
Has fill'd her orb, since low was laid<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;My Harriet! that sweet form of thine!<br>

<a id="p72">Page 72</a>

While each sad month, as slow it pass'd,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Brought some new sorrow to deplore;<br>
Some grief more poignant than the last,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But thou canst calm those griefs no more.<br>
<p>
<p>
No more thy friendship soothes to rest<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This wearied spirit tempest-toss'd;<br>
The cares that weigh upon my breast <br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Are doubly felt since thou art lost.<br>
<p>
<p>
Bright visions of ideal grace<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That the young poet's dreams inflame,<br>
Were not more lovely than thy face;<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Were not more perfect than thy frame.<br>
<p>
<p>
Wit, that no sufferings could impair,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Was thine, and thine those mental powers<br>
Of force to chase the fiends that tear<br>

<p>
O'er what, my angel friend, thou wert,<br>

<h2>FRAGMENT,</h2>

<em>Descriptive of the miseries of War; from a Poem<br>

called "The Emigrants," printed in </em>
1793.
<p>
TO a wild mountain, whose bare summit hides<br>
Its broken eminence in clouds; whose steeps<br>
<hr>
<a id="p73">Page 73</a>
<p>
Are dark with woods: where the receding rocks<br>
Are worn with torrents of dissolving snow;<br>
A wretched woman, pale and breathless, flies,<br>
And, gazing round her, listens to the sound<br>
Of hostile footsteps:--No! they die away--<br>
Nor noise remains, but of the cataract,<br>
Or surly breeze of night, that mutters low<br>
Among the thickets, where she trembling seeks<br>
A temporary shelter--Clasping close<br>
To her quick throbbing heart her sleeping child,<br>
All she could rescue of the innocent group<br>
That yesterday surrounded her--Escaped<br>
Almost by miracle!--Fear, frantic Fear,<br>
Wing'd her weak feet; yet, half repenting now<br>
Her headlong haste, she wishes she had staid<br>
To die with those affrighted Fancy paints<br>
The lawless soldiers' victims--Hark! again<br>
The driving tempest bears the cry of Death;<br>
And with deep, sudden thunder, the dread sound<br>
Of cannon vibrates on the tremulous earth;<br>
While, bursting in the air, the murderous bomb<br>
Glares o'er her mansion--Where the splinters fall<br>
Like scatter'd comets, its destructive path<br>
Is mark'd by wreaths of flame!--Then, overwhelm'd<br>
Beneath accumulated horror, sinks<br>
The desolate mourner!<br>
*               *               *              *               *               *<br>

The feudal chief, whose gothic battlements<br>
Frown on the plain beneath, returning home<br>
From distant lands, alone, and in disguise,<br>
Gains at the fall of night his castle walls,<br>
But, at the silent gate no porter sits<br>
To wait his lord's admittance!--In the courts<br>
All is drear stillness!--Guessing but too well<br>
The fatal truth, he shudders as he goes<br>
Through the mute hall; where, by the blunted light<br>
That the dim moon through painted casement lends,<br>
He sees that devastation has been there;<br>
Then, while each hideous image to his mind<br>
Rises terrific, o'er a bleeding corse<br>
Stumbling he falls; another intercepts<br>
<hr>
<a id="p74">Page 74</a>
<p>
His staggering feet--All, all who used to<br>
With joy to meet him, all his family<br>
Lie murder'd in his way!--And the day dawns<br>
On a wild raving maniac, whom a fate<br>
So sudden and calamitous has robb'd<br>
Of reason; and who round his vacant walls<br>
Screams unregarded, and reproaches Heaven!<br>

GREEN o'er the copses spring's soft hues are spreading,<br>

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;From their moss'd cradles start its infant buds.<br>
<p>
<p>
Pale as the tranquil tide of summer's ocean,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The willow now its slender leaf unveils;<br>
And through the sky with swiftly fleeting motion,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Driv'n by the wind, the rack of April sails.<br>
<p>
<p>
Then, as the gust declines, the stealing showers<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Fall fresh and noiseless; while at closing day<br>
The low sun gleams on moist and half-blown flowers,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That promise garlands for approaching May.<br>
<p>
<p>
Bless'd are yon peasant children, simply singing,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Who through the new-sprung grass rejoicing rove;<br>
More bless'd! to whom the <i>time</i>
, fond thought is bringing,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Of friends expected, or returning love.<br>
<p>
<p>
The pensive wanderer bless'd, to whom reflection<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Points out some future views that soothe his mind;<br>
Me how unlike!--whom cruel recollection<br>

Hope, that on Nature's youth is still attending,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;No more to me her syren song shall sing;<br>
Never to <i>me</i>
 her influence extending,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Shall I again enjoy the days of Spring!<br>
<p>
<p>
Yet, how I loved them once these scenes remind me,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;When light of heart, in childhood's thoughtless mirth,<br>
I reck'd not that the cruel lot assign'd me<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Should make me curse the hour that gave me birth!<br>
<p>
<p>
Then, from thy wild-wood banks, Aruna! roving,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Thy thymy downs with sportive steps I sought,<br>
And Nature's charms, with artless transport loving,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Sung, like the birds, unheeded and untaught.<br>
<p>
<p>
But now the springtide's pleasant hours returning,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Serve to awaken me to sharper pain;<br>
Recalling scenes of agony and mourning,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Of baffled hope and prayers preferr'd in vain.<br>
<p>
<p>
Thus shone the sun, his vernal rays displaying,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Thus did the woods in early verdure wave,<br>
While dire disease on all I loved was preying,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And flowers seem'd rising but to strew her grave.<br>
<p>
<p>
Now, 'mid reviving blooms, I coldly languish,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Spring seems devoid of joy to me alone;<br>
Each sound of pleasure aggravates my anguish,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And speaks of beauty, youth, and sweetness gone.<br>
<p>
<p>
Yet, as stern duty bids, with faint endeavour<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;I drag on life, contending with my woe,<br>
Though conscious misery still repeats, that never<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;My soul one pleasurable hour shall know.<br>
<p>
<p>
Lost in the tomb, when Hope no more appeases<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The fester'd wounds that prompt the eternal sigh,<br>
Grief, the most fatal of the heart's diseases,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Soon teaches, whom it fastens on, to die.<br>

<h2>ODE<br>
TO DEATH.</h2>
<p>
FRIEND of the wretched! wherefore should the eye<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Of blank Despair, whence tears have ceased to flow,<br>
Be turn'd from thee?--Ah! wherefore fears to die<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He, who compell'd each poignant grief to know,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Drains to its lowest dregs the cup of woe?<br>
<p>
<p>
Would Cowardice postpone thy calm embrace,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To linger out long years in torturing pain?<br>
Or not prefer thee to the ills that chase<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Him, who too much impoverish'd to obtain<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;From British Themis <i>right</i>
, implores her aid in vain!<br>
<p>
<p>
Sharp goading Indigence who would not fly,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That urges toil the exhausted strength above?<br>
Or shun the <i>once</i>
 fond friend's <i>averted</i>
 eye?<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Or who to <i>thy</i>
 asylum not remove,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To lose the wasting anguish of ungrateful love?<br>
<p>
<p>
Can then the wounded wretch, who must deplore<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What most she loved, to thy cold arms consign'd,<br>
Who hears the voice that soothed her soul no more,<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Fear <i>thee</i>
, O Death!--Or hug the chains that bind<br>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To joyless, cheerless life, her sick, reluctant mind?<br>

Of Woolbeding, another village on the banks of the
Arun (which runs through them both), his father
was rector. Here it was therefore that he probably
passed many of his early years. The Arun is here
an inconsiderable stream, winding in a channel
deeply worn, among meadow, heath, and wood.

misfortune. As I have never seen it dead, I know

<p>Middleton is a village on the margin of the sea,
in Sussex, containing only two or three houses.
There were formerly several acres of ground
between its small church and the sea, which now,
by its continual encroachments, approaches within
a few feet of this half ruined and humble edifice.
The wall, which once surrounded the church-yard,
is entirely swept away, many of the graves broken
up, and the remains of bodies interred washed into
the sea: whence human bones are found among the
sand and shingles on the shore.

<strong>ELEGY.</strong>

<p>This elegy is written on the supposition that an
indigent young woman had been addressed by the
son of a wealthy yeoman, who, resenting his attachment, had driven him from home, and compelled
him to have recourse for subsistence to the occupation of a pilot, in which, in attempting to save a
vessel in distress, he perished.
<p>The father dying, a tomb is supposed to be erected to his memory in the church-yard mentioned in Sonnet XLIV.  And while a tempest is
gathering, the unfortunate young woman comes
thither; and courting the same death as had robbed her of her lover, she awaits its violence, and is
at length overwhelmed by the waves.

<strong>THE ORIGIN OF FLATTERY.</strong>

<p>This little poem was written almost extempore
on occasion of a conversation where many pleasant
things were said on the subject of flattery; and
some French gentlemen who were of the party enquired for a synonym in English to the French
word fleurette. The poem was inserted in the two
first editions, and having been asked for by very respectable subscribers to the present, it is reprinted.
The Sonnets have been thought too gloomy; and
the author has been advised to insert some of a
more cheerful cast. This poem may by others be
thought too gay, and is indeed so little in unison
with the present sentiments and feelings of its
author, that it had been wholly omitted but for the
respectable approbation of those to whose judgment
she owed implicit deference.

Small, viewless aeronaut, &amp;c. &amp;c.<br>
<p>


<p>The almost imperceptible threads floating in the
air, towards the end of summer or autumn, in a
still evening, sometimes are so numerous as to be
felt on the face and hands. It is on these that a
minute species of spider convey themselves from
place to place; sometimes rising with the wind to
a great height in the air. Dr Lister, among other
naturalists, remarked these insects. "To fly they
cannot strictly be said, they being carried into the
air by external force; but they can, in case the
wind suffer them, steer their course, perhaps
mount and descend at pleasure: and to the purpose
of rowing themselves along in the air, it is observable that they ever take their flight backwards, that<hr>
<a id="p95">Page 95</a>
<p>
is, their head looking a contrary way like a sculler
upon the Thames. It is scarcely credible to what
height they will mount; which is yet precisely true,
and a thing easily to be observed by one that shall
fix his eye some time on any part of the heavens,
the white web, at a vast distance, very distinctly
appearing from the azure sky.--But this is in autumn only, and that in very fair and calm weather."

<p>Dr Darwin, whose imagination so happily applies every object of natural history to the purposes of poetry, makes the goddess of Botany thus direct her Sylphs--

and whose wearied eyes and languid spirits find

for a moment soothes my wounded mind.
<p>
<em>"Je pris gout a cette r&eacute;creation des yeux, qui
dans l'infortune, repose, amuse, distrait l'esprit, et
suspend le sentiment des peines."</em>



<p>Thus speaks the singular, the unhappy Rousseau, when in his "Promenades" he enumerates
the causes that drove him from the society of men,
and occasioned his pursuing with renewed avidity
the study of Botany. "I was," says he, "<em>Forc&eacute; de
m'abstenir de penser, de peur de penser a mes malheurs malgr&eacute; moi; forc&eacute; de contenir les restes
d'une imagination riante, mais languissante, que
tant d'angoisses pourroient effaroucher a la fin--</em>
"
<p>Without any pretensions to these talents which  
were in him so heavily taxed with that excessive
irritability, too often, if not always the attendant on
genius, it has been my misfortune to have endured
real calamities that have disqualified  me for finding any enjoyment in the pleasures and pursuits
which occupy the generality of the world. I have
been engaged in contending with persons whose
cruelty has left so painful an impression on my
mind, that I may well say<hr>

<p>Perhaps, if any situation is more pitiable than
that which compels us to wish to escape from the common business and forms of life, it is that where
the sentiment is forcibly felt, while it cannot be indulged; and where the sufferer, chained down to
the discharge of duties from which the wearied
spirit recoils, feels like the wretched Lear, when
Shakspeare makes him exclaim

<strong>THE DEAD BEGGAR.</strong>

<p>I have been told that I have incurred blame for
having used in this short composition, terms that
have become obnoxious to certain persons. Such
remarks are hardly worth notice; and it is very
little my ambition to obtain the suffrage of those
who suffer party prejudice to influence their taste;
or of those who desire that because they have themselves done it, every one else should be willing to
sell their best birth-rights, the liberty of thought,
and of expressing thought, for the <em>promise</em>
 of a mess
of pottage.
<p>It is surely not too much to say, that in a country like ours, where such immense sums are annually raised for the poor, there ought to be some
regulation which should prevent any miserable deserted being from perishing through want, as too
often happens to such objects as that on whose interment these stanzas were written.

<strong>DESCRIPTIVE ODE.</strong>

<p>The singular scenery here attempted to be described, is almost the only part of this rock of stones
worth seeing. On a high broken cliff hang the
ruins of some very ancient building, which the<hr>
<a id="p102">Page 102</a>
<p>
people of the island call Bow and Arrow Castle, or
Rufus' Castle. Beneath, but still high above the
sea, are the half-fallen arches and pillars of an old
church, and around are scattered the remains of
tomb-stones, and almost obliterated memorials of
the dead. These verses were written for, and first
inserted in, a Novel, called Marchmont; and the
close alludes to the circumstance of the story related in the Novel.

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Its wintry web among the sallow leaves.<br>
<p>


<p>Mosses and lichens are the first efforts of Nature
to clothe the earth: as they decay, they form an
earth that affords nourishment to the larger and
more succulent vegetables: several species of lichen
are found in the woods, springing up among the
dead leaves, under the drip of forest trees; these,
and the withered foliage of preceding years, afford
shelter to the earliest wild flowers about the skirts
of woods, and in hedge-rows and copses.
<p>The Pile-wort (<em>Ranuncula Ficaria</em>
) and the
Wood Anemone (<em>Anemone Nemerosa</em>
) or Windflower, blow in the woods and copses. Of this latter beautiful species there is in Oxfordshire a blue one, growing wild, (<em>Anemone pratensis pedunculo</em>
<hr>
<a id="p103">Page 103</a>
<p>
<em>involucrato, petalis apice reflexis foliis bipinnatis</em>
--Lin. Sp. Pl. 760.) It is found in Whichwood
Forest, near Cornbury quarry. (<em>Vide Flora Oxoniensis</em>
). I do not mention this by way of exhibiting
botanical knowledge (so easy to possess in appearance) but because I never saw the Blue Anemone
wild in any other place, and it is a flower of singular beauty and elegance.

said to be founded in truth! --<i>I</i>
, who have been
so sad a sufferer in this miserable contest, may well
<i>endeavour</i>
 to associate myself with those who apply
what powers they have to deprecate the horrors of
war. Gracious God! will mankind never be reasonable enough to understand that all the miseries
which our condition subjects us to, are light in
comparison of what we bring upon ourselves, by indulging the folly and wickedness of those who
make nations destroy each other for <i>their</i>
 diversion,
or to administer to their senseless ambition.


<p>
------If the stroke of war<br>
Fell certain on the guilty head, none else--<br>
If they that make the cause might taste th' effect,<br>

Then might the bard (the child of peace) delight<br>
To twine fresh wreaths around the conqueror's brow;<br>
Or haply strike his high-toned harp, to swell<br>
The trumpet's martial sound, and bid them on<br>
When <i>Justice</i>
 arms for vengeance; but, alas!<br>
That undistinguishing and deathful storm<br>
Beats heaviest on the exposed and innocent;<br>
And they that stir its fury, while it raves,<br>
Safe and at distance, send their mandates forth<br>
Unto the mortal ministers that wait<br>
To do their bidding!------<br>

<strong>ODE TO DEATH.</strong>

<p>From the following sentence in Lord Bacon's Essays.


<p>"Death is no such formidable enemy, since a
man has so many champions about him that can
win the combat of him--Revenge triumphs over
Death; Love slights it; Honour courts it; dread of
Disgrace chooses it; Grief flies to it; Fear anticipates it."


</ul>

THE END.
