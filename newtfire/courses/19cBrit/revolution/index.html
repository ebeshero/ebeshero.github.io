         back to his early radical years from his conservative
         middle age, the English poet Robert Southey
         (1774&#8211;1843) declared that</p>
      <blockquote>
         <p>few persons but those who have lived in
            it can conceive or comprehend what the memory
            of the French Revolution was, nor what a
            visionary world seemed to open upon those
            who were just entering it. Old things seemed
            passing away, and nothing was dreamt of but
            the regeneration of the human race.

      <p>In the prologue to his successful play <i>The
         Road to Ruin</i> (1792), Thomas Holcroft
         predicted that the French Revolution would &quot;fertilize
         a world, and renovate old earth!&quot; And
         in <i>The Prelude</i> (1805), Wordsworth
         remembered the early years of the Revolution
         as a time when all Europe</p>
      <blockquote>
         <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was
            thrilled with joy,<br>
            France standing on the top of golden hours,<br>
            And human nature seeming born again. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6.340&#8211;42;
            <i>NAEL</i> 2.346)</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Human nature regenerate in a world made new:
         this was the theme of many enthusiasts in England
         during the first four or five years after the
         outbreak of the French Revolution in 1789.
         These concepts are obviously theological. They
         originate in the apocalyptic and millennial
         passages of the Hebrew and Christian Scriptures,
         and their use indicates that for a number of
         British idealists, the early enthusiasm for
         the revolution had the momentum and excitement
         of a religious movement.</p>
      <p>The term <i>apocalypse,</i> derived from the
         Greek word meaning &quot;revelation,&quot; designates
         the disclosure, in the Bible, of God&#39;s
         providential design for the end of human history.
         In its fully developed form, an apocalypse
         is a prophetic vision, elaborately symbolic
         of the imminent events that will abruptly end
         the existing world order and replace it with
         a new and perfected condition both of humanity
         and of the world. The root elements of apocalypse
         are the concern of the Hebrew prophets with
         the catastrophic punishments to be visited
         upon Israel and its enemies in &quot;the latter
         end of the days,&quot; as well as with the
         expectation of a Messiah, a deliverer from
         suffering in this disaster-ridden world. These
         elements are collected in the writings attributed
         to the prophet Isaiah, which foretell, after
         God has vented His wrath, the advent of a renovated
         world of ease, joy, and peace. &quot;For, behold,
         I create new heavens and a new earth,&quot; in
         which &quot;the wolf and the lamb shall feed
         together, and the lion shall eat straw like
         the bullock&quot; (Isaiah 65.17&#8211;25).
         The Hebrew Bible also contains a full-fledged
         apocalypse, the Book of Daniel.</p>
      <p>Passages predicting an imminent apocalypse
         occur in the New Testament, both in the Synoptic
         Gospels and in the Epistles of Paul. The New
         Testament then concludes with the most spectacular
         and intricately ordered of all apocalyptic
         prophecies, the Book of Revelation. A series
         of seven symbolic events signalize the conflict
         between the forces of Christ and of Antichrist,
         culminating in a prodigious violence in which
         the stars fall like ripe figs and the harvest
         of the earth is cast &quot;into the great winepress
         of the wrath of God.&quot; (6.13). This fierce
         destruction, however, is a cleansing one, preparatory
         to the inauguration of the Kingdom of Christ
         on earth, which will last one thousand years &#8212; in
         Latin, a &quot;millennium,&quot; from which
         are derived the terms &quot;millennial&quot; and &quot;millenarian&quot; to
         signify the belief in a blissful earthly condition
         at the end of history. At the end of the millennium,
         the forces of evil are loosed again and finally
         defeated, after which the original creation,
         its function in the divine plot accomplished,
         will pass away, to be replaced by a new creation
         and by a new Jerusalem that will reconstitute,
         for the deserving elect, the paradise that
         was lost at the Fall: &quot;And there shall
         be no more death .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. neither shall
         there be any more pain: for the former things
         are passed away&quot; (21.4).</p>
      <p><a href="jerusalem.jpg"><img src="jerusalem.jpg" alt="[Click on image to enlarge]" width="135" height="200" class="lftthumb" border="0" align="left"></a> Two
         distinctive images occur persistently in later
         writings that derive from biblical apocalypses.
         One is the image of a sacred marriage that
         signifies the consummation of history. In Isaiah,
         the final redemption is figured as a marriage
         between the people of Israel and their land
         (62.2&#8211;5); in Revelation, it is figured
         as a marriage between Christ and the new, or
         purified, Jerusalem, &quot;coming down from
         God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned
         for her husband&quot; (21.2, 9&#8211;10). The
         second recurrent image represents the final
         condition of blessedness as a renovated heaven
         and earth. &quot;For, behold,&quot; the Lord
         said to Isaiah, &quot;I create new heavens
         and a new earth&quot; (65.17, also 66.22).
         Thus also Revelation: &quot;And I saw a new
         heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven
         and the first earth were passed away&quot; (21.1,
         also 21.5).</p>

         apocalyptic and millennial books in the Bible
         are readily convertible into a scenario for
         political revolution, since they consist of
         an infallible text ordaining a necessary destruction
         of the forces of evil and guaranteeing the
         outcome of this violence in peace, plenty,
         and consummate happiness. In the <a href="https://www.wwnorton.com/college/english/nael/17century/topic_3/welcome.htm">Civil
            Wars in seventeenth-century England</a>, for
         example, there were fervent apocalyptic expectations
         among radical parliamentary sects that were
         shared by Oliver Cromwell, as well as by John
         Milton. The late eighteenth century was another
         age of widespread apocalyptic expectation,
         when the promise of the American Revolution,
         followed by the greater and more radical expectations
         raised by the early years of the French Revolution,
         revived among a number of English Nonconforming
         sects the millenarian excitement of Milton
         and other seventeenth-century predecessors. &quot;Hey
         for the New Jerusalem! The millennium!&quot; Thomas
         Holcroft exulted in 1791.

           </span></span> Preachers
         such as Richard Price, Joseph Fawcett, and Elhanan Winchester, as well as Joseph
         Priestley, who was not only a great chemist but a founder of the Unitarian
         Society, all interpreted the convulsions in France in terms of the prophecies
         in both the Hebrew and the Christian Scriptures. They thus invested the political
         events of the day with the explosive power of the great Western myth of apocalypse
         and expanded a local phenomenon into the expectation that humanity, everywhere,
         was at the threshold of an earthly paradise.</p>
      <p> The phenomenon is of great literary importance
         because, during their formative period in the
         early 1790s, the first generation of Romantic
         poets incorporated in their poems a vision
         of the French Revolution as the early stage
         of the abrupt culmination of history, in which
         there will emerge a new humanity on a new earth
         that is equivalent to a restored paradise.
         In 1793, while still a student at Oxford, Robert
         Southey wrote <i>Joan of Arc: An Epic Poem</i>.
         In it Joan is granted a vision of a &quot;blest
         age&quot; in the future when, in a violent
         spasm not quite named the French Revolution,
         humanity shall &quot;burst his fetters,&quot; and &quot;Earth
         shall once again / Be Paradise&quot;.

         the <i>Song of Liberty</i> that he appended to <i>The Marriage of Heaven and
            Hell</i> in 1792, Blake represents a revolutionary &quot;son of fire&quot; moving
         from America to France and proclaiming an Isaian millennium: &quot;Empire is
         no more! and now the lion &amp; wolf shall cease&quot; (<i>NAEL</i> 8, 2.122). In the
         short prophetic poems of revolution that he wrote in the early 1790s, Blake
         introduced the Giant Form that he names &quot;Orc,&quot; the spirit of Energy
         that bursts out in total political and spiritual revolution. See also Blake&#39;s <i>America:
            A Prophecy</i> [1793], plates 6, 8, 16, and, for an earlier, nonsymbolic work
         on the events in France, <i>The French Revolution</i>. In 1793 Wordsworth concluded
         his <i>Descriptive Sketches</i> with the enthusiastic prophecy (which precisely
         matches the prophecy he attributed to the Solitary in his later poem <i>The
            Excursion</i>) that events following the French Revolution would fulfill the
         millennial prophecy of the Book of Revelation. In those happy early years of
         the revolution, Coleridge shared this expectation, in a historical sequence
         that he succinctly summarizes in his prose Argument of the plot of <i>Religious
            Musings</i> (1794) as &quot;The French Revolution. Millennium. Universal Redemption.
         Conclusion.&quot;</p>
      <p>Two decades later, the young Percy Shelley
         recapitulated the millenarian expectations
         of his older contemporaries. His early principles,
         Shelley said, &quot;had their origin&quot; in
         those views that &quot;occasioned the revolutions
         of America and France.&quot;

               Mab</i>, which he began writing at nineteen, presents a vision of the woeful
         human past and the dreadful present, as preceding a blissful future &quot;surpassing
         fabled Eden,&quot; of which most features are imparted from biblical millennialism.<a class="ilink" name="talfourd"></a></p>
      <p>Looking back in 1815, Thomas Noon Talfourd &#8212; an
         eminent jurist who was also a poet and playwright &#8212; analyzed
         the fashion in which the French Revolution
         had shaped the great literature of the age:</p>
      <blockquote>
         <p>At one moment, all was hope and joy and
            rapture; the corruption and iniquity of ages
            seemed to vanish like a dream; the unclouded
            heavens seemed once more to ring with the
            exulting chorus of peace on earth and good-will
            to men.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>But &quot;on a sudden&quot; the &quot;sublime
         expectation[s] were swept away&quot; in &quot;the
         terrible changes of this August spectacle.&quot; And
         an immediate effect &quot;of this moral hurricane
         .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. this rending of the general
         heart&quot; was &quot;to raise and darken the
         imagination,&quot; and so to contribute &quot;to
         form that great age of poetry which is now
         flourishing around us.&quot;
         <!-- stickynote: frnote5.htm -->
         <span class="anchor">&gt;&gt;<span class="note">(&quot;An Attempt to Estimate the Poetical Talent of the Present Age,&quot; <i>Pamphleteer</i> 5 (1815): 432&#8211;33.) </span></span> 
         Talfourd recognized the religious, apocalyptic nature of the enthusiasm and hopes evoked
         by the early years of the revolution; he recognized also, however, that the
         essential featureof the French Revolution as a cultural influence was that
         it had failed. The greatest poetry of the age was written not in the mood of
         revolutionary exaltation but in the mood of revolutionary disenchantment and
         despair, after the succession of disasters that began with the Reign of Terror
         in 1793&#8211;94. A number of the major Romantic poems, however, did not break
         with the formative past, but set out to salvage grounds for hope in a new and
         better world. That is, Romantic thought and imagination remained apocalyptic
         in form, but with a radical shift from faith in a violent outer transformation
         to faith in an inner moral and imaginative transformation &#8212; a shift from
         political revolution to a revolution in consciousness &#8212; to bring into
         being a new heaven and new earth.</p>

      <h3 id="priestley">Excerpt from Joseph Priestley, <i>The present state of Europe compared with antient prophecies : a sermon, preached at the Gravel Pit meeting in Hackney, February 28, 1794</i></h3>  
      <p class="intro"><a href="rioters.jpg"><img src="rioters.jpg" alt="[Click on image to enlarge]" width="200" height="163" class="rgtthumb" border="0" align="right"></a> Joseph
         Priestley (1733&#8211;1804) was a Unitarian
         minister, political writer, philosopher,
         and scientist in the fields of psychology
         and chemistry (he popularized David Hartley&#39;s
         theory of association of ideas and is credited
         with the discovery of oxygen). His enthusiastic
         endorsement of the French Revolution led
         to the destruction of his house, library,
         and laboratory in Birmingham by rioters on
         the second anniversary of the Fall of the
         Bastille, July 14, 1791. Priestley emigrated
         to Pennsylvania shortly after publishing
         this sermon, whose full title is <i>The Present
            State of Europe Compared with Antient Prophecies;
            A Sermon, Preached at the Gravel Pit Meeting
            in Hackney, February 28, 1794, Being the
            Day Appointed for a General Fast</i>. Priestley
         interprets the events in France in terms
         of the prophecy in the Book of Revelation,
         with the revolutionary violence as prelude
         to &quot;the millennium, of the future peaceable
         and happy state of the world.&quot;</p>
         </blockquote>
      <p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
      <blockquote>
         <p>If we can learn anything concerning what
            is before us, from the language of prophecy,
            great calamities, such as the world has never
            yet experienced, will precede that happy
            state of things, in which the &quot;kingdoms
            of this world will become the kingdom of
            our Lord Jesus Christ.&quot;&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* And it
            appears to me highly probable, as I hinted
            in my last discourse on this occasion, that
            the present disturbances in Europe are the
            beginning of those very calamitous times.&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>
         <p>It is enough for us to know the certainty
            of these great events, that our faith may
            not fail on the approach of the predicted
            calamity, confident that it will have the
            happiest issue in God&#39;s own time. For
            the same being who foretold the evil which
            we shall see come to pass, has likewise foretold
            the good that is to follow it.</p>
         <p>That the second coming of Christ will be
            coincident with the millennium, of the future
            peaceable and happy state of the world (which,
            according to all the prophecies, will take
            place after the restoration of the Jews),
            is evident from what Peter said, in his address
            to the Jews, on the occasion of his healing
            the lame man at the gate of the temple (Acts
            3.19).</p>
         <p>This great event of the late revolution
            in France appears to me, and many others,
            to be not improbably the accomplishment of
            the following part of the Revelation, chap.
            xi. 3: &quot;And the same hour there was
            a great earthquake, and the tenth part of
            the city fell, and in the earthquake were
            slain of men (or literally, <i>names of men</i>)
            seven thousand, and the remnant were affrighted,
            and gave glory to God.&quot;</p>
         <p>An earthquake, as I have observed, may signify
            a great convulsion, and revolution, in states;
            and as the Papal dominions were divided into
            ten parts, one of which, and one of the principal
            of them, was France, it is properly called <i>a
               tenth part of the city</i>, or of the mystical <i>Babylon</i>.
            And if by <i>names of men</i>, we understand
            their <i>titles</i>, such as those of the
            nobility, and other hereditary distinctions,
            all of which are now abolished, the accomplishment
            of the prediction will appear to be wonderfully
            exact.&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>
         <p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* What could have been more unexpected
            than the events of any one of the last four
            years, at the beginning of it? What a total
            revolution in the ideas, and conduct of a
            whole nation! What a total subversion of
            principles, what reverses of fortune, and
            what a waste of life! In how bloody and eventful
            a war are we engaged, how inconsiderable
            in its beginning, how rapid and wide in its
            progress, and how dark with respect to its
            termination! At first it resembled Elijah&#39;s
            cloud, appearing no bigger than a <i>man&#39;s
               hand</i> [1 Kings 18.44]; but now it covers,
            and darkens, the whole European hemisphere!</p>
         <p>Now, whatever we may think, as politicians
            (and with us every man will have his own
            opinion, on a subject so interesting to us
            all) I would, in this place, admonish you
            not to overlook the hand of God in the great
            scene that is now opening upon us. Nothing
            can ever come to pass without his appointment,
            or permission; and then, whatever be the
            views of men, we cannot doubt, but that his
            are always wise, righteous, and good. Let
            us, therefore, exercise faith in him, believing
            that though &quot;clouds and darkness are
            round about him, righteousness and judgment
            are for ever the habitation of his throne&quot; [Psalms
            97.2]. All those who appear in the theatre
            of public affairs, in the field, or the cabinet,
            both those whom we praise, and those whom
            we blame, are equally instruments in his
            hands, and execute all his pleasure. Let
            this reflection, then, in our cooler moments
            (and I hope we shall endeavour, in all the
            tumult of affairs, to make these as many
            as possible), lead us to look more to God,
            and less to man; and consequently, in all
            the troubles in which we may be involved,
            repose the most unshaken confidence in him,
            and thence &quot;in patience possess our
            own souls&quot; [Luke 21.19], especially
            when it is evident that it is wholly out
            of our power to alter the course of events.
            If we be careful so to live as to be at all
            times prepared to die, what have we to fear,
            even though, as the Psalmist says, the &quot;earth
            be removed, and the mountains be carried
            into the midst of the sea?&quot; [Psalms
            46.2]. Whatever turn the course of things
            may take, it cannot then be to our disadvantage.
            What, then, should hinder our contemplating
            the great scene, that seems now to be opening
            upon us, awful as it is, with tranquillity,
            and even with satisfaction, from our firm
            persuasion, that its termination will be
            glorious and happy?</p>

      <p class="intro"><a href="blake2.jpg"><img src="blake2.jpg" alt="[Click on image to enlarge]" width="163" height="200" class="rgtthumb" border="0" align="right"></a> The
         first book of William Blake&#39;s <i>The
            French Revolution</i> was set in type in
         1791 but was never actually published (it
         survives in a single set of page proofs).
         It traces, largely without symbolism, the
         history of the revolution shortly before
         and just after the Fall of the Bastille (July
         14, 1789). As the critic David Erdman describes
         it, &quot;the revolutionary events of June
         and July are treated as a single Day of Judgment
         or Morning of Resurrection during which the
         dark night of oppression lingers and fades
         in the marble hall of the Old Order while
         the Sun of democracy rises above the city
         streets and the people&#39;s Assembly.&quot;

         speaker in the extract here, the revolutionist and statesman Abb&eacute; Siey&egrave;s
         (1748&#8211;1793), addressed the French National Assembly, urging the withdrawal
         of troops from Paris, on July 6. The Abb&eacute; predicts the end of all
         forms of oppression (including black slavery, lines 213&#8211;16), and the
         coming of a millennial state in which &quot;men walk with their fathers in
         bliss&quot; (line 237).</p>
