      <div id="preface"> <h2>PREFACE.</h2> 
         <p>The First Volume of these Poems has already been submitted to
            general perusal. It was published, as an experiment which, I hoped, might be of some
            use
            to ascertain, how far, by fitting to metrical arrangement a selection of the real
            language of men in a state of vivid sensation, that sort of pleasure and that quantity
            of pleasure may be imparted, which a Poet may rationally endeavour to impart.
         </p>
         
         <p> I had formed no very inaccurate estimate of the probable effect of those Poems: I
            flattered myself that they who should be pleased with them would read them with more
            than common pleasure: and on the other hand I was well aware that by those who should
            dislike them they would be read with more than common dislike. The result has differed
            from my expectation in this only, that I have pleased a greater number, than I ventured
            to hope I should please.
         </p>
         
         <p>For the sake of variety and from a consciousness of my own weakness I was induced
            to
            request the assistance of a Friend, who furnished me with the Poems of the ANCIENT
            MARINER, the FOSTER-MOTHER’S TALE, the NIGHTINGALE, the DUNGEON, and the Poem entitled
            LOVE. I should not, however, have requested this assistance, had I not believed that
            the
            poems of my Friend would in a great measure have the same tendency as my own, and
            that,
            though there would be found a difference, there would be found no discordance in the
            colours of our style; as our opinions on the subject of poetry do almost entirely
            coincide.
         </p>
         
         <p>Several of my Friends are anxious for the success of these Poems from a belief, that
            if
            the views, with which they were composed, were indeed realized, a class of Poetry
            would
            be produced, well adapted to interest mankind permanently, and not unimportant in
            the
            multiplicity and in the quality of its moral relations: and on this account they have
            advised me to prefix a systematic defence of the theory, upon which the poems were
            written. But I was unwilling to undertake the task, because I knew that on this occasion
            the Reader would look coldly upon my arguments, since I might be suspected of having
            been principally influenced by the selfish and foolish hope of reasoning him into
            an
            approbation of these particular Poems: and I was still more unwilling to undertake
            the
            task, because adequately to display my opinions and fully to enforce my arguments
            would
            require a space wholly disproportionate to the nature of a preface. For to treat the
            subject with the clearness and coherence, of which I believe it susceptible, it would
            be
            necessary to give a full account of the present state of the public taste in this
            country, and to determine how far this taste is healthy or depraved; which again could
            not be determined, without pointing out, in what manner language and the human mind
            act
            and react on each other, and without retracing the revolutions not of literature alone
            but likewise of society itself. I have therefore altogether declined to enter regularly
            upon this defence; yet I am sensible, that there would be some impropriety in abruptly
            obtruding upon the Public, without a few words of introduction, Poems so materially
            different from those, upon which general approbation is at present bestowed.
         </p>
         
         <p>It is supposed, that by the act of writing in verse an Author makes a formal engagement
            that he will gratify certain known habits of association, that he not only thus apprizes
            the Reader that certain classes of ideas and expressions will be found in his book,
            but
            that others will be carefully excluded. This exponent or symbol held forth by metrical
            language must in different aeras of literature have excited very different expectations:
            for example, in the age of Catullus Terence and Lucretius, and that of Statius or
            Claudian, and in our own country, in the age of Shakespeare and Beaumont and Fletcher,
            and that of Donne and Cowley, or Dryden, or Pope. I will not take upon me to determine
            the exact import of the promise which by the act of writing in verse an Author in
            the
            present day makes to his Reader; but I am certain it will appear to many persons that
            I
            have not fulfilled the terms of an engagement thus voluntarily contracted. I hope
            therefore the Reader will not censure me, if I attempt to state what I have proposed
            to
            myself to perform, and also, (as far as the limits of a preface will permit) to explain
            some of the chief reasons which have determined me in the choice of my purpose: that
            at
            least he may be spared any unpleasant feeling of disappointment, and that I myself
            may
            be protected from the most dishonorable accusation which can be brought against an
            Author, namely, that of an indolence which prevents him from endeavouring to ascertain
            what is his duty, or, when his duty is ascertained prevents him from performing it.
         </p>
         
         <p>The principal object then which I proposed to myself in these Poems was to make the
            incidents of common life interesting by tracing in them, truly though not
            ostentatiously, the primary laws of our nature: chiefly as far as regards the manner
            in
            which we associate ideas in a state of excitement. Low and rustic life was generally
            chosen because in that situation the essential passions of the heart find a better
            soil
            in which they can attain their maturity, are less under restraint, and speak a plainer
            and more emphatic language; because in that situation our elementary feelings exist
            in a
            state of greater simplicity and consequently may be more accurately contemplated and
            more forcibly communicated; because the manners of rural life germinate from those
            elementary feelings; and from the necessary character of rural occupations are more
            easily comprehended; and are more durable; and lastly, because in that situation the
            passions of men are incorporated with the beautiful and permanent forms of nature.
            The
            language too of these men is adopted (purified indeed from what appear to be its real
            defects, from all lasting and rational causes of dislike or disgust) because such
            men
            hourly communicate with the best objects from which the best part of language is
            originally derived; and because, from their rank in society and the sameness and narrow
            circle of their intercourse, being less under the action of social vanity they convey
            their feelings and notions in simple and unelaborated expressions. Accordingly such
            a
            language arising out of repeated experience and regular feelings is a more permanent
            and
            a far more philosophical language than that which is frequently substituted for it
            by
            Poets, who think that they are conferring honour upon themselves and their art in
            proportion as they separate themselves from the sympathies of men, and indulge in
            arbitrary and capricious habits of expression in order to furnish food for fickle
            tastes
            and fickle appetites of their own creation.<span class="noteRef">[1]</span></p>
         <span class="footNote">[Footnote 1: It is worth while here to observe that the affecting
            parts of Chaucer are almost always expressed in language pure and universally
            intelligible even to this day.]</span>
         
         <p> I cannot be insensible of the present outcry against the triviality and meanness
            both
            of thought and language, which some of my contemporaries have occasionally introduced
            into their metrical compositions; and I acknowledge that this defect where it exists,
            is
            more dishonorable to the Writer’s own character than false refinement or arbitrary
            innovation, though I should contend at the same time that it is far less pernicious
            in
            the sum of its consequences. From such verses the Poems in these volumes will be found
            distinguished at least by one mark of difference, that each of them has a worthy
            purpose. Not that I mean to say, that I always began to write with a distinct purpose
            formally conceived; but I believe that my habits of meditation have so formed my
            feelings, as that my descriptions of such objects as strongly excite those feelings,
            will be found to carry along with them a purpose. If in this opinion I am mistaken
            I can
            have little right to the name of a Poet. For all good poetry is the spontaneous overflow
            of powerful feelings; but though this be true, Poems to which any value can be attached,
            were never produced on any variety of subjects but by a man who being possessed of
            more
            than usual organic sensibility had also thought long and deeply. For our continued
            influxes of feeling are modified and directed by our thoughts, which are indeed the
            representatives of all our past feelings; and as by contemplating the relation of
            these
            general representatives to each other, we discover what is really important to men,
            so
            by the repetition and continuance of this act feelings connected with important subjects
            will be nourished, till at length, if we be originally possessed of much organic
            sensibility, such habits of mind will be produced that by obeying blindly and
            mechanically the impulses of those habits we shall describe objects and utter sentiments
            of such a nature and in such connection with each other, that the understanding of
            the
            being to whom we address ourselves, if he be in a healthful state of association,
            must
            necessarily be in some degree enlightened, his taste exalted, and his affections
            ameliorated.
         </p>
         
         <p> I have said that each of these poems has a purpose. I have also informed my Reader
            what
            this purpose will be found principally to be: namely to illustrate the manner in which
            our feelings and ideas are associated in a state of excitement. But speaking in less
            general language, it is to follow the fluxes and refluxes of the mind when agitated
            by
            the great and simple affections of our nature. This object I have endeavoured in these
            short essays to attain by various means; by tracing the maternal passion through many
            of
            its more subtle windings, as in the poems of the IDIOT BOY and the MAD MOTHER; by
            accompanying the last struggles of a human being at the approach of death, cleaving
            in
            solitude to life and society, as in the Poem of the FORSAKEN INDIAN; by shewing, as
            in
            the Stanzas entitled WE ARE SEVEN, the perplexity and obscurity which in childhood
            attend our notion of death, or rather our utter inability to admit that notion; or
            by
            displaying the strength of fraternal, or to speak more philosophically, of moral
            attachment when early associated with the great and beautiful objects of nature, as
            in
            THE BROTHERS; or, as in the Incident of SIMON LEE, by placing my Reader in the way
            of
            receiving from ordinary moral sensations another and more salutary impression than
            we
            are accustomed to receive from them. It has also been part of my general purpose to
            attempt to sketch characters under the influence of less impassioned feelings, as
            in the
            OLD MAN TRAVELLING, THE TWO THIEVES, &amp;c. characters of which the elements are
            simple, belonging rather to nature than to manners, such as exist now and will probably
            always exist, and which from their constitution may be distinctly and profitably
            contemplated. I will not abuse the indulgence of my Reader by dwelling longer upon
            this
            subject; but it is proper that I should mention one other circumstance which
            distinguishes these Poems from the popular Poetry of the day; it is this, that the
            feeling therein developed gives importance to the action and situation and not the
            action and situation to the feeling. My meaning will be rendered perfectly intelligible
            by referring my Reader to the Poems entitled POOR SUSAN and the CHILDLESS FATHER,
            particularly to the last Stanza of the latter Poem.
         </p>
         
         <p> I will not suffer a sense of false modesty to prevent me from asserting, that I point
            my Reader’s attention to this mark of distinction far less for the sake of these
            particular Poems than from the general importance of the subject. The subject is indeed
            important! For the human mind is capable of excitement without the application of
            gross
            and violent stimulants; and he must have a very faint perception of its beauty and
            dignity who does not know this, and who does not further know that one being is elevated
            above another in proportion as he possesses this capability. It has therefore appeared
            to me that to endeavour to produce or enlarge this capability is one of the best
            services in which, at any period, a Writer can be engaged; but this service, excellent
            at all times, is especially so at the present day. For a multitude of causes unknown
            to
            former times are now acting with a combined force to blunt the discriminating powers
            of
            the mind, and unfitting it for all voluntary exertion to reduce it to a state of almost
            savage torpor. The most effective of these causes are the great national events which
            are daily taking place, and the encreasing accumulation of men in cities, where the
            uniformity of their occupations produces a craving for extraordinary incident which
            the
            rapid communication of intelligence hourly gratifies. To this tendency of life and
            manners the literature and theatrical exhibitions of the country have conformed
            themselves. The invaluable works of our elder writers, I had almost said the works
            of
            Shakespeare and Milton, are driven into neglect by frantic novels, sickly and stupid
            German Tragedies, and deluges of idle and extravagant stories in verse.—When I think
            upon this degrading thirst after outrageous stimulation I am almost ashamed to have
            spoken of the feeble effort with which I have endeavoured to counteract it; and
            reflecting upon the magnitude of the general evil, I should be oppressed with no
            dishonorable melancholy, had I not a deep impression of certain inherent and
            indestructible qualities of the human mind, and likewise of certain powers in the
            great
            and permanent objects that act upon it which are equally inherent and indestructible;
            and did I not further add to this impression a belief that the time is approaching
            when
            the evil will be systematically opposed by men of greater powers and with far more
            distinguished success.
         </p>
         
         <p>Having dwelt thus long on the subjects and aim of these Poems, I shall request the
            Reader’s permission to apprize him of a few circumstances relating to their style,
            in
            order, among other reasons, that I may not be censured for not having performed what
            I
            never attempted. Except in a very few instances the Reader will find no personifications
            of abstract ideas in these volumes, not that I mean to censure such personifications:
            they may be well fitted for certain sorts of composition, but in these Poems I propose
            to myself to imitate, and, as far as possible, to adopt the very language of men,
            and I
            do not find that such personifications make any regular or natural part of that
            language. I wish to keep my Reader in the company of flesh and blood, persuaded that
            by
            so doing I shall interest him. Not but that I believe that others who pursue a different
            track may interest him likewise: I do not interfere with their claim, I only wish
            to
            prefer a different claim of my own. There will also be found in these volumes little
            of
            what is usually called poetic diction; I have taken as much pains to avoid it as others
            ordinarily take to produce it; this I have done for the reason already alleged, to
            bring
            my language near to the language of men, and further, because the pleasure which I
            have
            proposed to myself to impart is of a kind very different from that which is supposed
            by
            many persons to be the proper object of poetry. I do not know how without being culpably
            particular I can give my Reader a more exact notion of the style in which I wished
            these
            poems to be written than by informing him that I have at all times endeavoured to
            look
            steadily at my subject, consequently I hope it will be found that there is in these
            Poems little falsehood of description, and that my ideas are expressed in language
            fitted to their respective importance. Something I must have gained by this practice,
            as
            it is friendly to one property of all good poetry, namely good sense; but it has
            necessarily cut me off from a large portion of phrases and figures of speech which
            from
            father to son have long been regarded as the common inheritance of Poets. I have also
            thought it expedient to restrict myself still further, having abstained from the use
            of
            many expressions, in themselves proper and beautiful, but which have been foolishly
            repeated by bad Poets till such feelings of disgust are connected with them as it
            is
            scarcely possible by any art of association to overpower.
         </p>
         
         <p>If in a Poem there should be found a series of lines, or even a single line, in which
            the language, though naturally arranged and according to the strict laws of metre,
            does
            not differ from that of prose, there is a numerous class of critics who, when they
            stumble upon these prosaisms as they call them, imagine that they have made a notable
            discovery, and exult over the Poet as over a man ignorant of his own profession. Now
            these men would establish a canon of criticism which the Reader will conclude he must
            utterly reject if he wishes to be pleased with these volumes. And it would be a most
            easy task to prove to him that not only the language of a large portion of every good
            poem, even of the most elevated character, must necessarily, except with reference
            to
            the metre, in no respect differ from that of good prose, but likewise that some of
            the
            most interesting parts of the best poems will be found to be strictly the language
            of
            prose when prose is well written. The truth of this assertion might be demonstrated
            by
            innumerable passages from almost all the poetical writings, even of Milton himself.
            I
            have not space for much quotation; but, to illustrate the subject in a general manner,
            I
            will here adduce a short composition of Gray, who was at the head of those who by
            their
            reasonings have attempted to widen the space of separation betwixt Prose and Metrical
            composition, and was more than any other man curiously elaborate in the structure
            of his
            own poetic diction.

         <p>It will easily be perceived that the only part of this Sonnet which is of any value
            is
            the lines printed in Italics: it is equally obvious that except in the rhyme, and
            in the
            use of the single word “fruitless” for fruitlessly, which is so far a defect, the
            language of these lines does in no respect differ from that of prose.
         </p>
         
         <p>Is there then, it will be asked, no essential difference between the language of prose
            and metrical composition? I answer that there neither is nor can be any essential
            difference. We are fond of tracing the resemblance between Poetry and Painting, and,
            accordingly, we call them Sisters: but where shall we find bonds of connection
            sufficiently strict to typify the affinity betwixt metrical and prose composition?
            They
            both speak by and to the same organs; the bodies in which both of them are clothed
            may
            be said to be of the same substance, their affections are kindred and almost identical,
            not necessarily differing even in degree; Poetry <span class="noteRef">[2]</span> sheds
            no tears “such as Angels weep,” but natural and human tears; she can boast of no
            celestial Ichor that distinguishes her vital juices from those of prose; the same
            human
            blood circulates through the veins of them both.
         </p>
         <span class="footNote">[Footnote 2: I here use the word “Poetry” (though against my own
            judgment) as opposed to the word Prose, and synonomous with metrical composition.
            But
            much confusion has been introduced into criticism by this contradistinction of Poetry
            and Prose, instead of the more philosophical one of Poetry and Science. The only strict
            antithesis to Prose is Metre.]</span>
         
         <p>If it be affirmed that rhyme and metrical arrangement of themselves constitute a
            distinction which overturns what I have been saying on the strict affinity of metrical
            language with that of prose, and paves the way for other distinctions which the mind
            voluntarily admits, I answer that the distinction of rhyme and metre is regular and
            uniform, and not, like that which is produced by what is usually called poetic diction,
            arbitrary and subject to infinite caprices upon which no calculation whatever can
            be
            made. In the one case the Reader is utterly at the mercy of the Poet respecting what
            imagery or diction he may choose to connect with the passion, whereas in the other
            the
            metre obeys certain laws, to which the Poet and Reader both willingly submit because
            they are certain, and because no interference is made by them with the passion but
            such
            as the concurring testimony of ages has shewn to heighten and improve the pleasure
            which
            co-exists with it. It will now be proper to answer an obvious question, namely, why,
            professing these opinions have I written in verse? To this in the first place I reply,
            because, however I may have restricted myself, there is still left open to me what
            confessedly constitutes the most valuable object of all writing whether in prose or
            verse, the great and universal passions of men, the most general and interesting of
            their occupations, and the entire world of nature, from which I am at liberty to supply
            myself with endless combinations of forms and imagery. Now, granting for a moment
            that
            whatever is interesting in these objects may be as vividly described in prose, why
            am I
            to be condemned if to such description I have endeavoured to superadd the charm which
            by
            the consent of all nations is acknowledged to exist in metrical language? To this
            it
            will be answered, that a very small part of the pleasure given by Poetry depends upon
            the metre, and that it is injudicious to write in metre unless it be accompanied with
            the other artificial distinctions of style with which metre is usually accompanied,
            and
            that by such deviation more will be lost from the shock which will be thereby given
            to
            the Reader’s associations than will be counterbalanced by any pleasure which he can
            derive from the general power of numbers. In answer to those who thus contend for
            the
            necessity of accompanying metre with certain appropriate colours of style in order
            to
            the accomplishment of its appropriate end, and who also, in my opinion, greatly
            under-rate the power of metre in itself, it might perhaps be almost sufficient to
            observe that poems are extant, written upon more humble subjects, and in a more naked
            and simple style than what I have aimed at, which poems have continued to give pleasure
            from generation to generation. Now, if nakedness and simplicity be a defect, the fact
            here mentioned affords a strong presumption that poems somewhat less naked and simple
            are capable of affording pleasure at the present day; and all that I am now attempting
            is to justify myself for having written under the impression of this belief.
         </p>
         
         <p>But I might point out various causes why, when the style is manly, and the subject
            of
            some importance, words metrically arranged will long continue to impart such a pleasure
            to mankind as he who is sensible of the extent of that pleasure will be desirous to
            impart. The end of Poetry is to produce excitement in coexistence with an overbalance
            of
            pleasure. Now, by the supposition, excitement is an unusual and irregular state of
            the
            mind; ideas and feelings do not in that state succeed each other in accustomed order.
            But if the words by which this excitement is produced are in themselves powerful,
            or the
            images and feelings have an undue proportion of pain connected with them, there is
            some
            danger that the excitement may be carried beyond its proper bounds. Now the co-presence
            of something regular, something to which the mind has been accustomed when in an
            unexcited or a less excited state, cannot but have great efficacy in tempering and
            restraining the passion by an intertexture of ordinary feeling. This may be illustrated
            by appealing to the Reader’s own experience of the reluctance with which he comes
            to the
            re-perusal of the distressful parts of Clarissa Harlowe, or the Gamester. While
            Shakespeare’s writings, in the most pathetic scenes, never act upon us as pathetic
            beyond the bounds of pleasure—an effect which is in a great degree to be ascribed
            to
            small, but continual and regular impulses of pleasurable surprise from the metrical
            arrangement.—On the other hand (what it must be allowed will much more frequently
            happen) if the Poet’s words should be incommensurate with the passion, and inadequate
            to
            raise the Reader to a height of desirable excitement, then, (unless the Poet’s choice
            of
            his metre has been grossly injudicious) in the feelings of pleasure which the Reader
            has
            been accustomed to connect with metre in general, and in the feeling, whether chearful
            or melancholy, which he has been accustomed to connect with that particular movement
            of
            metre, there will be found something which will greatly contribute to impart passion
            to
            the words, and to effect the complex end which the Poet proposes to himself.
         </p>
         
         <p>If I had undertaken a systematic defence of the theory upon which these poems are
            written, it would have been my duty to develope the various causes upon which the
            pleasure received from metrical language depends. Among the chief of these causes
            is to
            be reckoned a principle which must be well known to those who have made any of the
            Arts
            the object of accurate reflection; I mean the pleasure which the mind derives from
            the
            perception of similitude in dissimilitude. This principle is the great spring of the
            activity of our minds and their chief feeder. From this principle the direction of
            the
            sexual appetite, and all the passions connected with it take their origin: It is the
            life of our ordinary conversation; and upon the accuracy with which similitude in
            dissimilitude, and dissimilitude in similitude are perceived, depend our taste and
            our
            moral feelings. It would not have been a useless employment to have applied this
            principle to the consideration of metre, and to have shewn that metre is hence enabled
            to afford much pleasure, and to have pointed out in what manner that pleasure is
            produced. But my limits will not permit me to enter upon this subject, and I must
            content myself with a general summary.
         </p>
         
         <p> I have said that Poetry is the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings: it takes
            its
            origin from emotion recollected in tranquillity: the emotion is contemplated till
            by a
            species of reaction the tranquillity gradually disappears, and an emotion, similar
            to
            that which was before the subject of contemplation, is gradually produced, and does
            itself actually exist in the mind. In this mood successful composition generally begins,
            and in a mood similar to this it is carried on; but the emotion, of whatever kind
            and in
            whatever degree, from various causes is qualified by various pleasures, so that in
            describing any passions whatsoever, which are voluntarily described, the mind will
            upon
            the whole be in a state of enjoyment. Now if Nature be thus cautious in preserving
            in a
            state of enjoyment a being thus employed, the Poet ought to profit by the lesson thus
            held forth to him, and ought especially to take care, that whatever passions he
            communicates to his Reader, those passions, if his Reader’s mind be sound and vigorous,
            should always be accompanied with an overbalance of pleasure. Now the music of
            harmonious metrical language, the sense of difficulty overcome, and the blind
            association of pleasure which has been previously received from works of rhyme or
            metre
            of the same or similar construction, all these imperceptibly make up a complex feeling
            of delight, which is of the most important use in tempering the painful feeling which
            will always be found intermingled with powerful descriptions of the deeper passions.
            This effect is always produced in pathetic and impassioned poetry; while in lighter
            compositions the ease and gracefulness with which the Poet manages his numbers are
            themselves confessedly a principal source of the gratification of the Reader. I might
            perhaps include all which it is necessary to say upon this subject by affirming what
            few
            persons will deny, that of two descriptions either of passions, manners, or characters,
            each of them equally well executed, the one in prose and the other in verse, the verse
            will be read a hundred times where the prose is read once. We see that Pope by the
            power
            of verse alone, has contrived to render the plainest common sense interesting, and
            even
            frequently to invest it with the appearance of passion. In consequence of these
            convictions I related in metre the Tale of GOODY BLAKE and HARRY GILL, which is one
            of
            the rudest of this collection. I wished to draw attention to the truth that the power
            of
            the human imagination is sufficient to produce such changes even in our physical nature
            as might almost appear miraculous. The truth is an important one; the fact (for it
            is a
            fact) is a valuable illustration of it. And I have the satisfaction of knowing that
            it
            has been communicated to many hundreds of people who would never have heard of it,
            had
            it not been narrated as a Ballad, and in a more impressive metre than is usual in
            Ballads.
         </p>
         
         <p>Having thus adverted to a few of the reasons why I have written in verse, and why
            I have
            chosen subjects from common life, and endeavoured to bring my language near to the
            real
            language of men, if I have been too minute in pleading my own cause, I have at the
            same
            time been treating a subject of general interest; and it is for this reason that I
            request the Reader’s permission to add a few words with reference solely to these
            particular poems, and to some defects which will probably be found in them. I am
            sensible that my associations must have sometimes been particular instead of general,
            and that, consequently, giving to things a false importance, sometimes from diseased
            impulses I may have written upon unworthy subject; but I am less apprehensive on this
            account, than that my language may frequently have suffered from those arbitrary
            connections of feelings and ideas with particular words, from which no man can
            altogether protect himself. Hence I have no doubt that in some instances feelings
            even
            of the ludicrous may be given to my Readers by expressions which appeared to me tender
            and pathetic. Such faulty expressions, were I convinced they were faulty at present,
            and
            that they must necessarily continue to be so, I would willingly take all reasonable
            pains to correct. But it is dangerous to make these alterations on the simple authority
            of a few individuals, or even of certain classes of men; for where the understanding
            of
            an Author is not convinced, or his feelings altered, this cannot be done without great
            injury to himself: for his own feelings are his stay and support, and if he sets them
            aside in one instance, he may be induced to repeat this act till his mind loses all
            confidence in itself and becomes utterly debilitated. To this it may be added, that
            the
            Reader ought never to forget that he is himself exposed to the same errors as the
            Poet,
            and perhaps in a much greater degree: for there can be no presumption in saying that
            it
            is not probable he will be so well acquainted with the various stages of meaning through
            which words have passed, or with the fickleness or stability of the relations of
            particular ideas to each other; and above all, since he is so much less interested
            in
            the subject, he may decide lightly and carelessly.
         </p>
         
         <p>Long as I have detained my Reader, I hope he will permit me to caution him against
            a
            mode of false criticism which has been applied to Poetry in which the language closely
            resembles that of life and nature. Such verses have been triumphed over in parodies
            of
            which Dr. Johnson’s Stanza is a fair specimen.

         <p>Immediately under these lines I will place one of the most justly admired stanzas
            of the
            “Babes in the Wood.”
         </p>
         
         <div class="lg">
            
            <div class="line"><span class="num">19</span>“These pretty Babes with hand in hand
            </div>

            </div>
            
         </div>
         
         <p>In both of these stanzas the words, and the order of the words, in no respect differ
            from the most unimpassioned conversation. There are words in both, for example, “the
            Strand,” and “the Town,” connected with none but the most familiar ideas; yet the
            one
            stanza we admit as admirable, and the other as a fair example of the superlatively
            contemptible. Whence arises this difference? Not from the metre, not from the language,
            not from the order of the words; but the matter expressed in Dr. Johnson’s stanza
            is
            contemptible. The proper method of treating trivial and simple verses to which Dr.
            Johnson’s stanza would be a fair parallelism is not to say this is a bad kind of poetry,
            or this is not poetry, but this wants sense; it is neither interesting in itself,
            nor
            can lead to any thing interesting; the images neither originate in that sane state
            of
            feeling which arises out of thought, nor can excite thought or feeling in the Reader.
            This is the only sensible manner of dealing with such verses: Why trouble yourself
            about
            the species till you have previously decided upon the genus? Why take pains to prove
            that an Ape is not a Newton when it is self-evident that he is not a man.
         </p>
         
         <p> I have one request to make of my Reader, which is, that in judging these Poems he
            would
            decide by his own feelings genuinely, and not by reflection upon what will probably
            be
            the judgment of others. How common is it to hear a person say, “I myself do not object
            to this style of composition or this or that expression, but to such and such classes
            of
            people it will appear mean or ludicrous.” This mode of criticism so destructive of
            all
            sound unadulterated judgment is almost universal: I have therefore to request that
            the
            Reader would abide independently by his own feelings, and that if he finds himself
            affected he would not suffer such conjectures to interfere with his pleasure.
         </p>
         
         <p>If an Author by any single composition has impressed us with respect for his talents,
            it
            is useful to consider this as affording a presumption, that, on other occasions where
            we
            have been displeased, he nevertheless may not have written ill or absurdly; and,
            further, to give him so much credit for this one composition as may induce us to review
            what has displeased us with more care than we should otherwise have bestowed upon
            it.
            This is not only an act of justice, but in our decisions upon poetry especially, may
            conduce in a high degree to the improvement of our own taste: for an accurate taste
            in
            Poetry and in all the other arts, as Sir Joshua Reynolds has observed, is an acquired
            talent, which can only be produced by thought and a long continued intercourse with
            the
            best models of composition. This is mentioned not with so ridiculous a purpose as
            to
            prevent the most inexperienced Reader from judging for himself, (I have already said
            that I wish him to judge for himself;) but merely to temper the rashness of decision,
            and to suggest that if Poetry be a subject on which much time has not been bestowed,
            the
            judgment may be erroneous, and that in many cases it necessarily will be so.
         </p>
         
         <p> I know that nothing would have so effectually contributed to further the end which
            I
            have in view as to have shewn of what kind the pleasure is, and how the pleasure is
            produced which is confessedly produced by metrical composition essentially different
            from what I have here endeavoured to recommend; for the Reader will say that he has
            been
            pleased by such composition and what can I do more for him? The power of any art is
            limited and he will suspect that if I propose to furnish him with new friends it is
            only
            upon condition of his abandoning his old friends. Besides, as I have said, the Reader
            is
            himself conscious of the pleasure which he has received from such composition,
            composition to which he has peculiarly attached the endearing name of Poetry; and
            all
            men feel an habitual gratitude, and something of an honorable bigotry for the objects
            which have long continued to please them: we not only wish to be pleased, but to be
            pleased in that particular way in which we have been accustomed to be pleased. There
            is
            a host of arguments in these feelings; and I should be the less able to combat them
            successfully, as I am willing to allow, that, in order entirely to enjoy the Poetry
            which I am recommending, it would be necessary to give up much of what is ordinarily
            enjoyed. But would my limits have permitted me to point out how this pleasure is
            produced, I might have removed many obstacles, and assisted my Reader in perceiving
            that
            the powers of language are not so limited as he may suppose; and that it is possible
            that poetry may give other enjoyments, of a purer, more lasting, and more exquisite
            nature. But this part of my subject I have been obliged altogether to omit: as it
            has
            been less my present aim to prove that the interest excited by some other kinds of
            poetry is less vivid, and less worthy of the nobler powers of the mind, than to offer
            reasons for presuming, that, if the object which I have proposed to myself were
            adequately attained, a species of poetry would be produced, which is genuine poetry;
            in
            its nature well adapted to interest mankind permanently, and likewise important in
            the
            multiplicity and quality of its moral relations. From what has been said, and from
            a
            perusal of the Poems, the Reader will be able clearly to perceive the object which
            I
            have proposed to myself: he will determine how far I have attained this object; and,
            what is a much more important question, whether it be worth attaining; and upon the
            decision of these two questions will rest my claim to the approbation of the public.

         <div class="footNote">[When a Northern Indian, from sickness, is unable to continue his
            journey with his companions; he is left behind, covered over with Deer-skins, and
            is
            supplied with water, food, and fuel if the situation of the place will afford it.
            He is
            informed of the track which his companions intend to pursue, and if he is unable to
            follow, or overtake them, he perishes alone in the Desart; unless he should have the
            good fortune to fall in with some other Tribes of Indians. It is unnecessary to add
            that
            the females are equally, or still more, exposed to the same fate. See that very
            interesting work, Hearne’s Journey from Hudson’s Bay to the Northern Ocean. In the
            high
            Northern Latititudes, as the same writer informs us, when the Northern Lights vary
            their
            position in the air, they make a rustling and a crackling noise. This circumstance
            is
            alluded to in the first stanza of the following poem.]

            <p>NOTE to THE THORN</p>
            
            <p>—This Poem ought to have been preceded by an introductory Poem, which I have been
               prevented from writing by never having felt myself in a mood when it was probable
               that I should write it well.—The character which I have here introduced speaking is
               sufficiently common. The Reader will perhaps have a general notion of it, if he has
               ever known a man, a Captain of a small trading vessel for example, who being past
               the
               middle age of life, had retired upon an annuity or small independent income to some
               village or country town of which he was not a native, or in which he had not been
               accustomed to live. Such men having little to do become credulous and talkative from
               indolence; and from the same cause, and other predisposing causes by which it is
               probable that such men may have been affected, they are prone to superstition. On
               which account it appeared to me proper to select a character like this to exhibit
               some of the general laws by which superstition acts upon the mind. Superstitious men
               are almost always men of slow faculties and deep feelings; their minds are not loose
               but adhesive; they have a reasonable share of imagination, by which word I mean the
               faculty which produces impressive effects out of simple elements; but they are
               utterly destitute of fancy, the power by which pleasure and surprize are excited by
               sudden varieties of situation and by accumulated imagery.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>It was my wish in this poem to shew the manner in which such men cleave to the same
               ideas; and to follow the turns of passion, always different, yet not palpably
               different, by which their conversation is swayed. I had two objects to attain; first,
               to represent a picture which should not be unimpressive yet consistent with the
               character that should describe it, secondly, while I adhered to the style in which
               such persons describe, to take care that words, which in their minds are impregnated
               with passion, should likewise convey passion to Readers who are not accustomed to
               sympathize with men feeling in that manner or using such language. It seemed to me
               that this might be done by calling in the assistance of Lyrical and rapid Metre. It
               was necessary that the Poem, to be natural, should in reality move slowly; yet I
               hoped, that, by the aid of the metre, to those who should at all enter into the
               spirit of the Poem, it would appear to move quickly. The Reader will have the
               kindness to excuse this note as I am sensible that an introductory Poem is necessary
               to give this Poem its full effect.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>Upon this occasion I will request permission to add a few words closely connected
               with THE THORN and many other Poems in these Volumes. There is a numerous class of
               readers who imagine that the same words cannot be repeated without tautology: this
               is
               a great error: virtual tautology is much oftener produced by using different words
               when the meaning is exactly the same. Words, a Poet’s words more particularly, ought
               to be weighed in the balance of feeling and not measured by the space which they
               occupy upon paper. For the Reader cannot be too often reminded that Poetry is
               passion: it is the history or science of feelings: now every man must know that an
               attempt is rarely made to communicate impassioned feelings without something of an
               accompanying consciousness of the inadequateness of our own powers, or the
               deficiencies of language. During such efforts there will be a craving in the mind,
               and as long as it is unsatisfied the Speaker will cling to the same words, or words
               of the same character. There are also various other reasons why repetition and
               apparent tautology are frequently beauties of the highest kind. Among the chief of
               these reasons is the interest which the mind attaches to words, not only as symbols
               of the passion, but as things, active and efficient, which are of themselves part
               of
               the passion. And further, from a spirit of fondness, exultation, and gratitude, the
               mind luxuriates in the repetition of words which appear successfully to communicate
               its feelings. The truth of these remarks might be shewn by innumerable passages from
               the Bible and from the impassioned poetry of every nation.

            possesses an excellence far superior to that of mere description: it is spoken in
            the
            character of the melancholy Man, and has therefore a dramatic propriety. The Author
            makes this remark, to rescue himself from the charge of having alluded with levity
            to a
            line in Milton: a charge than which none could be more painful to him, except perhaps
            that of having ridiculed his Bible.]

         <div class="footNote">NOTE to the ANCIENT MARINER.—I cannot refuse myself the gratification
            of informing such Readers as may have been pleased with this Poem, or with any part
            of
            it, that they owe their pleasure in some sort to me; as the Author was himself very
            desirous that it should be suppressed. This wish had arisen from a consciousness of
            the
            defects of the Poem, and from a knowledge that many persons had been much displeased
            with it. The Poem of my Friend has indeed great defects; first, that the principal
            person has no distinct character, either in his profession of Mariner, or as a human
            being who having been long under the controul of supernatural impressions might be
            supposed himself to partake of something supernatural: secondly, that he does not
            act,
            but is continually acted upon: thirdly, that the events having no necessary connection
            do not produce each other; and lastly, that the imagery is somewhat too laboriously
            accumulated. Yet the Poem contains many delicate touches of passion, and indeed the
            passion is every where true to nature; a great number of the stanzas present beautiful
            images, and are expressed with unusual felicity of language; and the versification,
            though the metre is itself unfit for long poems, is harmonious and artfully varied,
            exhibiting the utmost powers of that metre, and every variety of which it is capable.
            It
            therefore appeared to me that these several merits (the first of which, namely that
            of
            the passion, is of the highest kind,) gave to the Poem a value which is not often
            possessed by better Poems. On this account I requested of my Friend to permit me to
            republish it.
