      <h1><span class="banner">Portfolio Standards for the Digital Studies Certificate at Pitt-Greensburg</span></h1>
      			
      			
     <p>The following are standards for the development of digital portfolios to satisfy completion requirements for the <a href="https://www.greensburg.pitt.edu/academics/majors-minors/digital-studies">Digital Studies Certificate</a> at the <a href="http://greensburg.pitt.edu">University of Pittsburgh at Greensburg</a>. </p>		
      			
     <ul>
        
        
        <li>Portfolios may be developed in any personally manageable web space that the student chooses, though we recommend the students use their individual web directory on <a href="https://newtfire.org">newtfire.org</a> (used in the core coding course), the <a href="http://technology.pitt.edu/support/creating-your-own-web-site">University of Pittsburgh's personal web space</a>, or <a href="https://pages.github.com/">student webspace freely available on GitHub.io</a>. </li>
        <li>A digital portfolio must meet the following standards:
        <ul>
          
           <li>Brief (paragraph-length) descriptions and links to each publically-accessible digital project to which you have contributed in your courses connected with the Digital Studies Certificate program. (If you worked on a project that you cannot link to because it is not available for public view, provide a title and description and, if available, links for further information on the course, the project, or your work.)</li>
           <li>For each project featured, include information on the semester (Fall 2015), course title and number (Hum 1030: Coding and Digital Archives), and the professors and students with whom you worked.</li>
          <li>Descriptions of group projects must highlight your contributions to the project. Point out what you worked on, and feature it in some way.</li>
          <li>Your projects should feature a Creative Commons License appropriate for your work, and/or make clear any proprietary restrictions, that is, any work that is owned by another party. 
          <ul>
            <li>Be mindful of proprietary restrictions and whether your work is entirely your own to share. You are responsible for requesting and securing permission from the appropriate parties who own copyright on material you worked on or featured, and following their instructions (such as a link and clear reference to the source site).</li>
            <li>Any faculty member on the Digital Studies committee will be happy to guide and assist you with this process.</li>
          </ul>
          </li>
         <li>Content on the portfolio page must be organized in some clear way, perhaps to separate different kinds of projects and technologies applied. Some prefacing explanation is useful to introduce and reflect on your work.</li>  
           <li>The portfolio page must include a linked online résumé, that should be prepared for web searching. Ideally this should be prepared in HTML and not PDF or Word form. </li>
           <li>The portfolio page or the résumé must contain a list of computing technologies and skills gained during pursuit of the certificate. </li>
           
           
        </ul>
        
        
        
        </li>
        <li>Web Portfolio pages must pass W3C Validation for the standard form of HTML (currently HTML 5). You can check your portfolio's validity in the &lt;oXygen/&gt; editing software or through the <a href="http://validator.w3.org/">World Wide Web Consortiums's Markup Validation Service</a>.
        </li>
