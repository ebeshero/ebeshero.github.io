      <h1><span class="banner">XPath Exercise 3</span></h1>
      <p>To begin, download this XML file from our Pacific Voyage project that I have linked here:
            <a href="ForsterGeorgComplete.xml">ForsterGeorgComplete.xml</a>. Open the file in
         &lt;oXygen/&gt; and work with the XPath 3.1 Window. Respond to the XPath questions below in
         a text file, and <a href="https://canvas.pitt.edu">upload to Canvas</a> for this
         assignment when you’re finished. (Please use an attachment! If you paste your answer into
         the text box, Canvas may munch your code syntax.) Some of these tasks are
         thought-provoking, and even difficult. If you get stuck, do the best you can, and if you
         can’t get a working answer, give the answers you tried and explain where they failed to get
         the results you wanted. Sometimes doing that will help you figure out what’s wrong, and
         even when it doesn’t, it will help us identify the difficult moments. </p>
      <p><b>These tasks require the use of path expressions, predicates, and the functions <code>count()</code>,
            <code>not()</code>, <code>name()</code>, <code>position()</code>, <code>last()</code>, and <code>distinct-values()</code>, but they should not require
            any other XPath functions.</b> There may be more than one possible answer. To read about
         these functions, you should consult <cite class="sub"><a
               href="https://dh.obdurodon.org/functions.xhtml">The XPath Functions We Use
            Most</a></cite> page and if you have the Michael Kay text, it may be useful to you here.
         As always, consult our class notes and our introductory guide <cite class="sub"><a
               href="explainXPath.html">Follow the XPath!</a></cite>. </p>
      <p><b>Be sure to give the FULL
            XPath expression you used in your answer, and don’t just report your results.</b> This
         way, if the answer is incorrect, we can help explain what went wrong. <br /> ** Notation:
         For ease in recognition, from now on when we refer in discussion to an attribute name,
         we’ll precede it with an at sign (<span class="code">@</span>). In other words, when we
         write about the <span class="code">@type</span> attribute  below, the name of the attribute
         is actually <span class="code">type</span> (without an at sign). </p>
      <ol>

         <li>Working with <span class="code">@type</span>: <ol class="d">

               <li>Write an XPath using a function that returns a count of number of times we’ve
                  used <span class="code">@type</span> attributes in the Georg Forster file. </li>

               <li>What’s the XPath to return the parent elements (whatever they are) of @type?</li>

               <li>Modify the XPath in your previous statement to return in the bottom results
                  window the <strong>names</strong> of those parent elements </li>

               <li>Modify the XPath expression once more to return a list of only the <span
                     class="code">distinct-values</span> of those parent elements.
               </li>


            </ol>
         </li>

         <li>Working with attributes of ANY kind: <ol class="d">

               <li>Write an XPath expression to return all the attributes of any kind, anywhere in
                  this file. </li>

               <li>Using the <span class="code">name()</span> function, build on your previous XPath
                  expression to return the names of these attributes. </li>

               <li>Now, return only the distinct-values of those attribute names: What XPath
                  expression does this? </li>

               <li>Now, what if we wanted to find all the <b>parent elements</b> (without knowing
                  what they are) of any attributes in use within the <b>body</b> element of the
                  file? Write the XPath expression. </li>

               <li>What’s the XPath to return the <span class="code">distinct-values</span> of the
                     <b>names</b> of those parent elements in the body of the file. </li>

               <li>How many distinctly different element names are holding attributes of any kind?
                  (What expression returns this as a count?) </li>

            </ol>
         </li>


         <li>Working with the <code>count()</code>, <code>position()</code>, and <code>last()</code> functions in predicates:<br /> 
            (These questions involve locating specific paragraphs by writing some complex predicates. The questions will ask you to find a special paragraph that contains a <code>count()</code> of something
            and set it equal to, greater than, or less than a particular number. 
            You will find examples of how to write this code in the <a href="https://dh.newtfire.org/explainXPath.html#comparison">Value Comparison section of our XPath tutorial</a>.) <ol class="d">

               <li>Write an XPath expression that returns the <b>last</b> paragraph in the ENTIRE
                  Georg Forster file that contains <b>more than one</b> latitude record, coded as
                     <span class="code">&lt;geo select="lat"&gt;</span>. (Hint: This builds on
                  things we showed you in the XPath Exercise 2 homework. Note that you should only
                  get ONE result here!) </li>

               <li>Modify the expression so you return the <b>first</b> paragraph in the ENTIRE
                  Georg Forster file that contains <b>more than two</b> latitude records. (There’s
                  no such thing as a first function, but remember how we found the first, second,
                  and third books and chapters in past XPath exercises? The same working with
                  position numbers applies here.) Again, you should only get one result in your
                  results window. </li>

               <li>Now, how would we write XPath to find <b>the very last paragraph in Book 2</b>
                  that contains <b>more than 1 latitude record</b>? As before, you should only get
                  one result for this. </li>

               <li>Now, can you write an XPath expression that finds <b>the very first</b> paragraph
                  holding <b>more than two latitude</b> records, that also holds <b>more than one
                        <span class="code">placeName</span> element</b>? </li>

               <li>How would you modify the previous expression to return the contents of the
                  placeName elements in that paragraph? What are the placeNames? </li>

            </ol>
         </li>
         <li><strong>To earn Extra Credit:</strong> Try out a new XPath function that we haven't yet assigned on this
            file. Look up functions in <cite class="sub"><a
               href="https://dh.obdurodon.org/functions.xhtml">The XPath Functions We Use
               Most</a></cite>, the <cite class="sub"><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/XPath/Functions">MDN list of XPath functions</a></cite>, or in the Michael Kay book if you have it. Explain what you tried, give
            your XPath expression, and describe its results in your return window.</li>
