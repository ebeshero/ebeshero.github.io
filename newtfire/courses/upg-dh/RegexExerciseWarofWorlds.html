      </ul>	
     
     <h2>The test</h2>
     <ul><li>For this test you need to download the <a href="War-of-the-Worlds-1938-regex.txt">War-of-the-World-1938.txt</a> file from the Newtfire site.</li>
     
     <li>After you have the file downloaded and opened the file in oXygen, open the Find/Replace window.</li>
     
        <li>Open new text file to record your steps. <strong>Record each step of your process on the following tasks carefully</strong>, since this is the file we will be evaluating. These will include global Find-and-Replace operations or Regular Expressions in oXygen (using Ctrl-F on Windows or command-F on Mac). Your goal is to produce a well-formed XML document, but even if you have have trouble, what's most important is that you document the steps you took.</li>
     
     <li>We have already verified for you that there are no reserved characters.</li>
     
     <li>Also there are no groups of blank lines exceeding 2 (\n{2}).</li>
     </ul>
     
     <h3>Your Tasks:</h3>   
     
      <ol> <li><p>Find all of the speakers. Use <code>&lt;spkr&gt;</code> in your replace window to wrap all of the speakers. Record your Find and Replace expressions with a brief description and any additional alterations you made to the text file.</p>
        
         <p>Bonus: Tag all of the speeches and corresponding speakers. Use <code>&lt;sp&gt;</code> for speech and <code>&lt;spkr&gt;</code> for speaker. Record your Find and Replace expressions  with a brief description and any additional alterations you made to the text file. [Hint: remember how you wrapped chapters or acts!]</p></li>
           
           <li>Find all of the stage directions in parenthesis. Tag all of the stage directions with <code>&lt;sd&gt;</code> removing the pseudo-markup (a.k.a. the parentheses). Record your Find and Replace expressions with a brief description and any additional alterations you made to the text file.</li>
              
              <li>Make sure you add a root element and verify your new XML file is green in oXygen.</li>
              
         <li><strong>Upload two files on Courseweb for this exercise:</strong>
            <ol>
               <li>a plain-text file in which you recorded your steps </li>
               
               <li>your end result: the XML file you create</li>
            </ol>
         </li>
      </ol>
