            <h3>Before you begin</h3>
            <p>Before beginning this assignment, you should prepare your workspace: Where 
                do you want to do your coding homework this semester? You will be doing most of
                your coding work for this course in the &lt;oXygen/&gt; XML Editor. This is
                installed in the campus computer labs, and you may also install it on any other
                computer(s) you plan to work with this semester. Also, before beginning homework
                assignments, you need to read the related tutorials we have posted (plus notes you
                took in class) and keep these open and handy to consult as you are working. For the
                very first assignment, here is what you will need:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Install the &lt;oXygen/&gt; software on your own computer(s) Follow the <a
                        href="https://courseweb.pitt.edu">instructions and apply the license key we
                        have posted on Courseweb</a>.</li>
                <li>Read our <a href="explainXML.html"><q>Introduction to XML</q></a></li>
                <li>Read <a href="explainFileNames.html"><q>File Conventions for CourseWeb
                            Assignments</q></a>, so you will know how to name this and most other
                    homework files you submit on Courseweb.</li>

            <h3>Goals</h3>
            <p>This assignment should give you experience with:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Writing <dfn>well-formed</dfn> XML using elements and attributes.</li>
                <li>Making decisions in how to write XML so that it binds related kinds of
                    information together by: <ul>
                        <li>Thinking of elements and attributes working together (like file folders
                            with labels attached).</li>
                        <li><dfn>Nesting</dfn> elements that relate to each other.</li>
                    </ul></li>
                <li>Using basic features of the &lt;oXygen/&gt; software environment.</li>

        <section title="scenario">
            <h3>Scenario</h3>
            <p>First, read this recipe for <a
                    href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/recipes/country-loaf-pain-de-campagne/14237/?utm_term=.ac16692197d2"
                    >homemade bread</a>, and pretend you are filing it with hundreds of other
                recipes that you need to fit a set purpose, such as running a restaurant, in which
                you need to keep track of kinds and quantities of ingredients required. XML is
                written to store information, and when we apply it to a situation with numbers and
                units, like with coding recipes, the code we write can help make computerized
                calculations, and help optimize searching across a collection for particular kinds
                of ingredients. Your code might be designed to help categorize ingredients by what
                part of the grocery store they can be found in. The challenge of the assignment is
                to write code that helps categorize ingredients, mark necessary equipment, and
                stages for processing, but the system you develop is up to you.</p>

        <section title="step_by_step">
            <h3>Coding the document in &lt;oXygen/&gt;</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>First, highlight and copy the text of just the recipe (the list of ingredients
                    and method), and ignore the rest of the page.</li>

                <li>Open a new XML document in &lt;oXygen/&gt;. Click on the icon at top left that
                    looks like a piece of paper with a folded corner (or go to File and New...),
                    type <code>XML</code> in the filter window, and click the <code>Create</code>
                    button to launch a new XML document.</li>
                <li>Paste in the recipe, and begin marking it to apply <dfn>elements</dfn> and add
                        <dfn>attributes</dfn>.</li>
                <li>Tips: Watch the color of the square in the upper right corner: if it is green,
                    your code is well-formed, but if it turns <q>angry red</q>, you will know there
                    is an error, perhaps <dfn>tangled tags</dfn> or a missing angle bracket, or a
                    missing <dfn>root element</dfn>. Notice how &lt;oXygen/&gt; generates a closing
                    tag every time you type your own start tag. One handy trick is to you use your
                    mouse to highlight text you want to wrap in an element, and use Control+E in
                    Windows (or Command+E on a Mac) to bring up a window to enter an element name.
                    (You have to add the attributes after you set an element name.)</li>
                <li>Save your work frequently, and name your file using our <a
                        href="explainFileNames.html">standard form for homework names</a>.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Curating the document: Suggestions for XML markup</h3>
            <p>Frequently the XML code we write is designed for <dfn>digital curation</dfn>, for
                preserving and collecting resources. Usually we would not rewrite the <dfn>base
                    text</dfn> of a recipe like this, but we would apply markup around passages, so
                that our markup supplies some information in a more systematic way. For example,
                spaces and formatting on the page tell our human eyes something about the document,
                like how to distinguish each item on a list. That formatting information is
                    <strong>not preserved</strong> in XML, and so one of the first things we mark
                are the structural <q>pieces</q>. What are the important parts of this recipe that
                you need to distinguish from other parts? Use XML markup to <q>tag</q> those. Then,
                what is the important information that you can label with markup? Try not to write
                markup that copies the same words and phrases in the text: think of categories and
                standard units you can supply so that your markup <em>adds new value</em> to the
                text.</p>
            <p> Sidenote: If you are looking for some ideas for your code, you might take a look at
                    <a href="http://forkthecookbook.com/">Fork the Cookbook</a>, a GitHub-based
                recipe center that has worked out a system for contributors to store volumes and
                measures, and tracking instructions. (We will be learning how to work with GitHub in
                this class, too.)</p>
            <p>There is no single way to do this exercise, but we want you to think about how you
                nest levels of information (elements within elements), and the relationship between
                elements and attributes in XML.</p>
