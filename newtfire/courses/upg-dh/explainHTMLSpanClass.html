        <h1><span class="banner">Using &lt;span&gt; and @class to style your HTML</span></h1>
        <h4>How to use <code>@class</code></h4>
        <p>You can style in-line elements with such basic HTML tags as <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> for
            emphasis, <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> for strong emphasis, etc., but what if you want to
            assign style that isn’t supported by the basic HTML tags? For example, what if you need
            to make your text red?</p>
        <p>The HTML <code>@class</code> attribute is a very useful way to subcategorize HTML
            elements. For example, suppose you have two paragraph-like elements in your input XML,
            one for good examples of something (perhaps called <code>&lt;good_example&gt;</code>)
            and one for bad examples (perhaps called <code>&lt;bad_example&gt;</code>). You’d like
            to transform both into HTML <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> elements, but you want the good
            example to be green and the bad example to be red. In XML you gave them different names,
            so you could style them with different CSS rules, but HTML has predefined tags and is
            thus more restrictive; if you want them to look and behave like paragraphs, the natural
            way to do that is to make both <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> elements. Fortunately, you can
            still style these two paragraphs differently by giving them different values for the
            <code>@class</code> attribute. For example, if you output the good example as
            <code>&lt;p class="good"&gt;</code>, you can specify in your CSS that all
            <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> elements whose <code>@class</code> attribute has the value of
            <q>good</q> should be colored green.</p>
        <p>The syntax for specifying the value of the <code>@class</code> attribute in CSS is to
            concatenate, in order and with no intervening spaces, the name of the element, a dot,
            and the name of the class. For example:</p>
        <pre>p.good {color: green;}</pre>
        <p>says <q>style all <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> elements with an attribute <code>@class</code>
            whose value is <q>good</q> by coloring the text green.</q></p>
        <h4>How to use <code>&lt;span&gt;</code></h4>
        <p>Assigning a <code>@class</code> attribute value to an element like <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>
            to control its styling is natural because the element <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> occurs
            naturally in the structure of the output HTML. That is, it’s easy to style a
            paragraph because you can attach the <code>@class</code> attribute to the opening
            <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag. But what if you want to tag just a few words the middle
            of a sentence, which had a specific element structure in the original XML, but where
            there isn’t a corresponding HTML element to which you could transform it? That is, what
            if there’s no place to attach the <code>@class</code> attribute in the HTML output?</p>
        <p><code>&lt;span&gt;</code> is an all-purpose in-line element. It has no special meaning
            and no default rendering properties. The point of <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> is that it
            serves as a place to hang a <code>@class</code> attribute, enabling you to style
            arbitrary text. If, for example, your XML says something like:</p>
        <pre>&lt;paragraph&gt;On the wall there was a sign that said &lt;warning&gt;beware&lt;/warning&gt;&lt;/paragraph&gt;</pre>
        <p>You could transform that into:</p>
        <pre>&lt;p&gt;On the wall there was a sign that said &lt;span class="warning"&gt;beware&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</pre>
        <p>and then include in your CSS:</p>
        <pre>span.warning { color: yellow; }</pre>
        <p>This would cause the word <q>beware</q> to appear in yellow.</p>
