		  <h2>ECCO Location Phase 2: Simplify and Expand</h2>
		  <p>In our Box DH/DS Collaborative Folder, go to our ECCO Location Group Files and download the summary file I've made, <strong><a href="https://pitt.box.com/s/h6e2mibl97wi4ahclt8b">ECCOLocatAll1.xml</a></strong> . Open it in oXygen. 
	      This single XML file contains all the contents of <span class="code">&lt;list @type=&quot;successful&quot;&gt;</span> from each of your group ECCO Location forms that you made a couple of weeks ago.<em> (Aside: I produced this file using <strong>XQuery in eXist</strong>, an XML database program that lets us work with multiple XML files and extract information from them systematically. I wanted to start teaching you this on Wed. 10/9, but the database hasn't yet been made available to the DH class students--bummer! We will have to start this next week.)</em></p>
		  <p>As we saw in class, our list contains lots of duplicate entries, and we need to process the information to extract the most interesting material. For our purposes, remember, we're looking for material to add to our archive of <strong>literary and philosophical material written by people who were reading the Pacific voyage narratives and their new information about Tahiti and Tahitians</strong>. We're looking for material that doesn't just summarize, repeat, or extract the voyage accounts, but processes and responds to events in new ways--fitting it into English and European culture.</p>
		  <p>We want each of you to review this ECCOLocatAll1.xml summary file. Remind yourself of the structure of the ECCOlocation form, (look at it in the Outline view in oXygen), and notice how this is organized as a list of successful search hits.  Notice how there's a single outer <span class="code">&lt;list type=&quot;successful&quot;&gt;</span>, and inside it are <span class="code">&lt;item&gt;</span> elements. <strong>Inside each item</strong> is a set of successful search terms for use in ECCO and a <span class="code">&lt;listBibl&gt;</span>, with<span class="code"> &lt;bibl&gt;</span> entries (really bibliography entries) for each successful search query. (We did a little XPath on this in class to locate all the <span class="code">&lt;bibl&gt;</span> elements, and their children<span class="code"> &lt;title&gt;</span> and <span class="code">&lt;author&gt;</span>  elements.		  </p>
		  <ol>
		    <li><strong>Simplify:</strong> For part 1 of this homework exercise, we'd like you to generate a new XML file, which is simply its own distinct bibliography list. 
		      <ul>
            <li>Let's use <span class="code">&lt;listBibl&gt;</span> as our root element for the whole document. (This is a standard tag in humanities text encoding to indicate a bibliography list). Inside it, we'll prepare a reduced and simplified list of <span class="code">&lt;bibl&gt;</span> entries. You'll be copying <span class="code">&lt;bibl&gt;</span> entries worth keeping from ECCOLocatAll1.xml file into this new file. (Save the new file with your name in it, like this: <strong>BondarECCOBibl.xml </strong>.)<br/></li>
            <li> Here's where we ask you to do some careful review and selection, using your human eyes and brains, going back and forth between the 36 entries in our ECCOLocatAll1.xml file and <a href="http://find.galegroup.com/ecco/start.do?prodId=ECCO&amp;userGroupName=upitt_main"><strong>the ECCO database in the Pitt Digital Library</strong></a>. </li>
            <li>In oXygen, write yourself XPath expressions to navigate the ECCOLocatAll1.xml file, to help you locate and organize by titles or authors, so you can quickly move through duplicate entries.<br />
            </li>
            <li>In ECCO, look up specific titles and authors, using the <strong>Advanced Search feature</strong> and changing the default from &quot;Entire Document&quot; to &quot;Author&quot; and &quot;Title&quot; as appropriate from the dropdown menus on the search form. Reduce by years of publication as needed. </li>
            <li>When your result is a huge set of files or a big document, use <strong>&quot;Search within these results&quot;</strong> and plug in the search terms we marked for this bibl's item listing in ECCOLocatAll1.xml form. This will look up the specific passages that generated Pacific / Tahitian results in the ECCO files. </li>
            <li><strong>Review the relevant texts and pages in ECCO, and make a judgment call:</strong> Would this be a useful text for us to code in XML for our archive? (Does it represent a some kind of imaginative processing of the voyage accounts?) <strong>If it's worth keeping</strong>, copy the  <span class="code">&lt;bibl&gt;</span> entry into your new simplified  <span class="code">&lt;listBibl&gt;</span> file. </li>
            <li>We want <strong>only ONE copy of each distinct text </strong>in this simplified <span class="code">&lt;listBibl&gt;</span> file, so we're concentrating on removing duplicate entries. For texts in multiple volumes, add to the <span class="code">&lt;bibl&gt;</span> listing a new tag named <span class="code">&lt;vol&gt;</span>, and inside it, indicate the specific volume numbers that give relevant results. If there are multiple volume numbers, indicate this in a comma separated list, like this: <span class="code">&lt;vol&gt;1, 4, 13&lt;/vol&gt;</span>.</li>
            <li>In the <span class="code">&lt;note&gt;</span> element within the <span class="code">&lt;bibl&gt; </span>entry,  replace or add to the old note with your new commentary on what's significant about this 18th-century text: why we should consider working on it. Notice if there's a striking use of terms connected with Tahiti or Pacific cultures, and include these in your improved note: This will be useful in stage 2 of this assignment, below.</li>
            <li><strong>Save your complete new listBibl file, make sure it's well-formed XML. </strong>Now begin working with it on a new round of ECCO location in stage 2.<br/><br/>
            </li>
              </ul>
		      </li> 
            </li>
            <li><strong>Expand:            
            </strong>  Now, try running some new ECCO searches based on likely new search terms you've discovered in the particularly interesting texts on your list. Record your results in <strong><a href="https://pitt.box.com/s/syqsdkakmq8ldo592jup">a new ECCOLocation form</a></strong> we've prepared in our Box (same folder) for this stage of the assignment.
            <ul>
        <li>Choose at least <strong>three new search terms</strong> you can find from the texts in your listBibl file. (Looking at the texts in ECCO, pick out some Pacific / Tahitian terms from them to test in a <strong>more general keyword search in ECCO, setting the year parameters between 1770 - 1800. </strong></li>
            <li>Enter your results in the new ECCOLocation form, including successful and unsuccessful hits and their number as before, and including any new texts in new bibl entries. </li>
            <li>Add your name to the <span class="code">&lt;resp&gt;</span> element (which stands for responsibility) at the top of the file. Save this file using your last name like this: <strong>BondarECCOLocate2.xml</strong><br/><br/></li>
            
              </ul>
            </li>
              <li> <strong>Upload</strong> your files to Courseweb for this Project Assignment, <strong>due by Tues. 10/15 (after Fall Break)</strong>: You should upload two files for this Project assignment: 1) yourLastNameECCOBibl.xml and 2) yourLastNameECCOLocate2.xml.<br/><br/></li>
              
          </ol>
