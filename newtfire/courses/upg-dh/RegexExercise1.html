      <ul>
         			  
         <li>Read and consult <b><a href="https://pitt.box.com/s/a1sukx2ckg11x7qh9e5d">our notes
                  			    on how to work with Autotagging and Regular Expressions
                  			    (regex)--posted in Box</a></b>.
         </li>
         			  
         <li>Autotagging and Regex Exercise: Take this <a href="https://pitt.box.com/s/g7lreivogcw66fvtpo32">plain-text
               			    version of the table of contents of Johann Forster's voyage
               			    account (in Box)</a>: Paste its contents into oXygen.<br />
            			    <br />
            			  
         </li>
         			  
         <li>Autotag this file to achieve these results (in <a href="https://pitt.box.com/s/m8745s0zx3iessc8p9t4">our model XML
               			    file</a>), and <b>record each step of your process
               			      carefully</b>, either in a plain text file or Microsoft Word. All of
            			    your XML files should look the same as our final result, but even if
            			    you have have trouble, what's MOST important is that <b>you document
               			      the steps you took</b>. We're grading your explanation of how
            			    you got from the text file to the final XML form. These will include
            			    global Find-and-Replace operations in oXygen (using Ctrl-F on
            			    Windows or command-F on Mac). <br />
            			    <br />
            			  
         </li>
         			  
         <li><b>Your output should look <a href="https://pitt.box.com/s/m8745s0zx3iessc8p9t4">like this
                  			    XML file for Johann Forster's table of contents</a> (and
               			    look at the coding on this). </b>That is, each entry on the
            			    table of contents should be its own element, and follow the list
            			    structure we've used here: Notice how lists are nested inside lists
            			    at multiple levels!<br />
            			    <br />
            
         </li>
         			  
         <li><b>Upload on Courseweb:</b> 1) the document in which you recorded
            			    your steps (either a text file or a Word document, whichever is
            			    convenient), and 2) the your end result XML file. (Sure, it should
            			    look like ours, but if you had trouble with the autotagging this
            			    will help us spot problems.)
