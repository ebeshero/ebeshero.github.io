            <p><strong>Fall 2020 Syllabus (Schedule)</strong>
               Classes meet M W F 10:10 - 11am over Zoom and in Kochel 77. Zoom attendance is required for all students in all class meetings. The classroom is optional, but even in the classroom you will be connecting to Zoom to team up with your classmates.
               We plan to host Wednesday meetings only in Kochel 77, as long as the class is willing and it is safe.
               For in-class meetings, we must all wear masks and maintain a safe social distance. Remember: <em>Your mask protects me, my mask protects you</em>.
               </p>

            <p>Download and install the following software on your own personal computer(s) on or
               before the first day of class. These software tools are available in our campus computing

                  The DIGIT program has purchased a site license for this software, which
                  is installed in Kochel 77 and the Lilley Library computers. The license also permits
                  students enrolled in the
                  course to install the software on their home computers (for course-related use
                  only). When installing this on your own computers, <strong>you will need the
                     license key</strong>, which we have posted on our course Announcements section of
                  <a href="https://canvas.psu.edu" target="_blank">Canvas</a>.</li>
               <li>Zoom: <a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362233-Upgrade-update-to-the-latest-version">Make sure your Zoom installation is up-to-date</a>, and you are ready to
                  connect. The Zoom link for our regularly scheduled class meetings is posted in
                  Canvas: Look for the Zoom menu option. </li>
               
               
               <li>All students require a good means of secure file transfer (SFTP) for homework
                  assignments and projects (also available in the campus computer labs). There are
                  several good options available. We recommend you download and install on your own
                  computers one (or more) of the following, depending on your platform: (Feel free
                  to experiment with these and others!)

                  who never saw anything like markup or XML code have designed projects (<a href="https://newtfire.org/courses/studentProjects.html" target="_blank">like these</a>) and even spoken about them at undergraduate conferences! You will learn to develop
                  your own digital tools and how to manage digital projects as teamwork.
