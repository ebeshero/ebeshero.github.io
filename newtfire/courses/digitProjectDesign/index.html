            <h2>Digital Project Design: Course Description</h2>
            
            <p>This course is all about working with computers and digital technology to build cultural
               resources on the public web. In taking this course you will gain experience with textual
               scholarship, editing, and digital production, and you will learn a variety of coding
               designed for systematic building and sharing of information resources.
            </p>

            <p>Students who complete this course will gain skills in practical hands-on programming,
               digital project management, and
               web development. Your digital projects will distinguish you as investigators
               and makers, able to wield computers creatively and effectively for human interests.
               Your success will require patience, dedication, and regular communication and
               interaction with us, working through assignments on a daily basis. Your success will
               <strong>not</strong> require perfection, but rather your regular efforts throughout the course and your
               documenting of problems when your coding doesn’t yield the results you want. Homework
               exercises are a back-and-forth, intensive dialogue between you and your instructors,
               and we plan to spend a great deal of time with you individually over these as we work
               together. Our guiding principle in developing assignments and working with you is
               that the best way for you to learn and succeed is through regular practice as you
               hone your skills. Our goal is not to make you expert programmers (as I am far from
               that myself). Instead, I want you to learn how to apply coding technologies for
               your own purposes, how to track down answers to questions, how to ask for help, and how to find answers to questions by searching and experimenting.
               In designing a digital project, you will gain skills in thinking algorithmically (step-by-step) through problems to find good solutions.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Learning to Code: Our Context</h2>
            
            <p>You do not need any background at all with computer programming or web
               development to succeed in this course. 
               We teach practical programming as a foundational skill (like reading, writing, and
               arithmetic) that all students should experience regardless of major or background.
            </p>
            
            <p>You will be learning to write, test, and share code to build a digital project. You
               will be working in teams to investigate a research topic in the humanities. You
               students will propose and select the project ideas we will work on in this class,
               with guidance from me. You will be learning to build projects with eXtensible Markup
               Language (XML) and languages connected with it, because XML is a powerful tool for
               modelling texts that we can adapt creatively to our interests and questions. You will
               learn how to work with regular expressions to match patterns in plain text and
                  <q>up-convert</q> them to an XML document. You’ll gain lots of experience with
               writing XPath expressions: a formal language for searching and extracting information
               from XML code which serves as the basis for transforming XML into many publishable
               forms. You’ll learn to write XSLT: a programming “stylesheet” transforming language
               designed to convert XML to publishable formats, as well as to extract information and
               plot it in charts in graphs in Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG). You will learn how to
               design your own systematic coding methods to work on projects, and how to write your
               own rules in schema languages (like Schematron and Relax-NG) to keep your projects
               organized and prevent errors. Depending on the project you work on, you may gain
               experience with an international XML language called TEI (after the Text Encoding
               Initiative) which serves as an international standard for coding digital archives of
               cultural materials. Since one of the best and most widely accessible ways to publish
               XML is on the worldwide web, you will definitely gain working experience with HTML
               code (another markup language related to XML). You will be styling HTML with
               Cascading Stylesheets (CSS), and adding dynamic features to your website with
               JavaScript. You will also, all along, be working with Git and GitHub for
               collaborating with the class and your project team, and gaining command line (or
               shell) experience. </p>
            
            <p> While we are using XML in an academic research context, 
               what you learn here is also important in the tech industry, where XML is the internal
               format for many general applications (used for bank and hospital records, and the
               basis of the entire Microsoft Office and LibreOffice software packages). 
               XML is important, too, for web developers, where the HTML (hypertext markup language)
               of web pages to be viewed in browsers is often expressed as a form of XML (as we will
               be applying it).  Developers of relational databases work widely with XML, too, as
               a universal data interchange format.
               Finally, gaining fluency in the XML <q>family of languages</q> in a humanities context may give you a strong foundation in practical computing experience
               and I hope what you learn here will help you build a distinctive
               portfolio of skills and projects.

            <h3>Homework Exercises (30%):</h3>
            
            <p>To keep up with this class, you must work on exercises regularly. Each day will
                  involve some small assignment, to prepare you for the next of class, and to help
                  you to build your course project.  <b>90% Rule: </b>If students do not submit at
                  least 90% of the regular homework assignments, the grade for the homework portion
                  is based on the percentage of homework they completed. Students should therefore
                  aim to submit at least 90% of the regular homework assignments, and complete at
                  least 90% of the work in each component of the course. </p>
            
            
            <p>
               <strong>About homework assignments:</strong>  Coding and project review exercises in this course are about your active learning, and not—as in other
               courses—a way of testing whether you have already learned something we covered in
               class or in an assigned reading. You may often need to look up how to do something
               that you don’t already know how to do. Often, there will be multiple ways of accomplishing
               the task and we are not simply looking for you to do things perfectly in just one
               way. We are instead looking for a record of your learning process as you take on a
               challenge. Documenting problems is key to learning, and sometimes just writing out
               what you are trying to do helps lead you to a solution! There may be
               times when you don’t get the result you want in the homework, and that is to be expected!
               In those cases you can still get full credit for the assignment if you’ve made a serious
               attempt and if you submit, along with your code, a description of what else you tried,
               what results you expected, what results you got, and what you think went wrong. Getting
               stuck is part of the learning process. You will see me get stuck sometimes, and I will need <em>your eyes</em> to help me fix something!
              As long as you’ve described your understanding of the problem and your attempts
              to resolve it on your own, you will do well: documentation of how you get stuck is key. One of our goals is to form a supportive coding community in this class, so we are comfortable with <em>unsticking</em> each other, 
            </p>
            
            <p>I will read and evaluate all student homework, and will post assessments on Canvas. 
               Coding assignments are assessed as <strong><q>check plus</q></strong>, <strong><q>check</q></strong>, and <strong><q>check minus</q></strong>, or <strong><q>redo</q></strong>.
               Don’t think of these as grades, since, if you resubmit a <q>redo</q> to correct a serious problem, you will receive full credit for the assignment. 
               My comments on homework are feedback
               for learning purposes. If you have
               not engaged with the assignment adequately (whether that means solving the tasks or
               discussing the coding obstacles you encountered and how you dealt with them), we will
               ask you to meet with us to review the issues and then complete a followup (redo) task
               in order to receive credit. For assignments with posted solutions, I will invite you to
               review the posted solution on GitHub and comment on it (we will show you how to do
               this) to address something you learned from the solution or did in a different way.
               For some assignments where we review posted solutions and line-comments together in
               person or in class, we will write back to you with individual comments only if your
               specific submission raises an issue that we don’t address elsewhere. If we don’t return
               your assignment, that means that we have nothing to add to our posted solution, but
               should you have any specific questions after you’ve read our posted solution, please
               ask the instructors.  And we will go over assignments together to get the class unstick on things in our regular class meetings.
            </p>
            
            
            
            <p>
               <strong>Issue posts:</strong> Throughout the course, we’ll assign discussion posts on <a href="https://github.com/newtfire/digitProjectDesign-Hub">our class GitHub site</a> in which you will respond to online readings or evaluate web resources. Your posting
               should do more than
               summarize the article or site (which you could just do by skimming or reading
               the first paragraph), but should demonstrate a thoughtful reflection on
               specific ideas and issues. When evaluating a web resource, don’t simply praise
               or condemn it without going into details about why a key component is effective
               or poorly designed. Good posts demonstrate care and reflection, and
               you may choose to respond to the overarching ideas of a piece, or to selected
               details of specific interest. These posts are scored as <q>check plus</q>, <q>check</q>, and <q>check minus</q>.
            </p>
            
            
            
            
            
            <h3>Participation: In Class and on GitHub (15%):</h3>
            
            <p> Coding and programming in real life is a social activity, and professionals in
               the real world aren’t “know-it-all” experts who work alone, but rather are tuned
               into discussion boards and regularly ask and answer questions to stay sharp and to
               learn from their community. In this class, we want you to work together and talk
               to each other and your instructors as your community resource, so we have built
               this into our course participation grade as a formal expectation. <strong>Beginning by week two, we’ll expect each student to post at least once per
                  week on <a href="https://github.com/newtfire/digitProjectDesign-Hub">our course GitHub repo</a></strong>, and we strongly encourage you
               to do more than this minimum. Earn an <q>A</q> in participation by asking questions, making suggestions, and sharing helpful
               resources you’ve found. Help each other out by trying to answer questions on GitHub
               (and
               read the instructor posts too as we wade in to help). Your instructors will likely
               be dominating the class time as we model concepts and methods, so the GitHub Issues
               board gives the students a good space to form into a coding community to help each
               other and reflect together. Also, if you have a question about an assignment, <strong>always think of our GitHub Issues board as your first resource</strong> to
               check for helpful hints and to post your questions, because others may have the
               same question and answers are best shared! Of course you may e-mail us, but we
               really prefer you go the discussion board first, and doing so is, after all, worth
               course credit as your participation grade.
            </p>
            
            
            
            <h3>Tests (15%):</h3>
            
            <p>As scheduled throughout the course there will be several (probably about five or six)
               tests on the various kinds of coding we are learning in the course, and we will drop
               the lowest grade.  All will be take-home or taken online in between classes.
               They are open-book, open notes, but they must be completed individually and are designed
               to demonstrate that you have learned from the class material, coding assignments,
               and posted solutions.  Tests may resemble homework assignments, but unlike homework
               exercises, these are given letter grades. These are given grades because they are
               evaluative and involve demonstrating what you have learned after we have finished
               a coding unit.
            </p>
            
            
            
            <h3>Project (40%):</h3>
            
            <p>Throughout the semester you will be working as part of a team on a course project.
               Early in the semester each student posts a proposal for a semester project to work
               with a text (or collection of texts) in the public domain and a set of research questions
               to explore in a coding project. Teams will form around a selection of these projects
               in mid-September and begin work, performing document analysis, developing and implementing
               a system of markup and project rules, marking up text following that system, writing
               programs to conduct research and create a resource to share on a public website you
               will develop together that represents your investigation and your conclusions. Each
               project team must meet regularly together and check in with me <!--and with a project mentor (one of the instructor
               team)--> outside of class for project planning and discussion. Each of the project components
               described below adds up to 40% of your grade for the course.
            </p> 
            
            <p><strong>Project Checkpoints</strong> There will be a series of project checkpoints to complete, by set due dates throughout
               the semester. Each is worth 5% of the final course grade (a total of 20%) and a letter
               grade on the following scale:  <q>exceeds target</q> (A+), <q>meets target</q> (A), <q>some progress</q> (B), <q>negligible progress</q> (C), <q>no progress</q>(F). Each checkpoint will expect you to complete a stage of serious work on the course
               project with your project team. Project Checkpoints are met using the Issues and/or
               Projects tabs on your project GitHub repository and by posting files on the project
               website on newtFire.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>The course project develops throughout the semester, but is fully assembled in the
               final weeks of the course and submitted in two places, through code and documentation
               shared in your GitHub repository and on your project website due in Finals Week. Projects
               are evaluated as a team effort, but if unequal effort is observed, project members
               may receive different project grades accordingly. The Final Project grade is worth
               20% of the course grade.
            </p>
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            <h3>Grading Scale:</h3>
            
            <p>Grades for the course are calcuated and posted on Canvas, and follow this standard
               scale: A: 93-100%, A-:
               90-92%, B+: 87-89%, B: 83-86%, B-: 80-82%, C+: 77-79%, C: 70-76%, D: 60-69%, F: 59% and below. In taking the course on a S / NC (pass-fail)
               basis, students must earn a C to receive Satisfactory credit.

               <h2>Course Policies:</h2>
               <p>Each day we are covering material that builds on earlier material and assignments,
                  so your success depends upon regular attendance and completing each assignment on
                  time. </p>
               <!--    <h3>Attendance:</h3>-->
               <p><!--We strictly require your attendance, as it is not only a setback to yourself but
               to the entire class and the success of our projects if students are repeatedly
               absent. Students must attend at least 90% of our class meetings in order <strong>to pass</strong> the course (that is, a maximum of four absences for any reason). Late arrival—particularly
               a pattern of
               repeated late arrivals—may be counted as absences at our discretion. To be considered
               attending for a class period, you
               must be present in the classroom by the beginning of class and until class is
               dismissed. For your own sanity, do not miss two consecutive classes. If you are
               experiencing a genuine emergency or crisis, alert us and provide documentation.
               (We do not want you to attend class if you have a fever or flu-like symptoms! If
               you wish to be excused from two or more consecutive class
               meetings due to your own
               documented illness, please contact one of the following: the Office of the Vice
               President for Academic Affairs, Prof. Jackie Horrall (724-836-7482 or jhorrall at
               pitt.edu), our Campus Health Center (Pamela Reed, 724-836-9947 or
               pmr20 at pitt.edu), or the Director of Counseling, Gayle Pamerleau (gaylep at
               pitt.edu), who can then officially alert all of your professors.--></p>
               <h3>Due dates and why we need them:</h3>
               <p> Your daily homework for this course is time-sensitive! Coding assignments,
                  response papers, and other homework exercises must be uploaded to Canvas (or
                  GitHub or our web server as specified), by the due date and time indicated on the
                  class schedule. Homework assignments will be posted online to our class website
                  and linked from our schedule, so students who miss class are nevertheless expected
                  to consult the schedule and submit assignments on time. Because we post and share
                  answers to homework exercises after submission deadlines, we will usually not
                  accept late homework submissions. </p>
               <h3>Exam Policy:</h3>
               <p>All exams will be take-home, to do on your own time, with submissions due in
                  Canvas or by web submission. Because I will be posting answers and sharing them in
                  class, I do not allow people to write exams after the solutions are posted.
                  However, I will drop your lowest exam score for the class, so that you may miss
                  one exam without penalty. </p>
               <h3>Attendance and Classroom Courtesy:</h3>
               <p>I am not calculating your attendance, but I will expect your active presence and
                  interaction with me and your classmates this semester, as we need to rely on each
                  other to learn and develop projects.</p>
               <p>Our class is fast paced and requires that we all be making the best use we can of
                  our in-person class sessions. Arriving late and leaving early (physically or
                  remotely!) disrupts the important collective mental activity of class. So does
                  in-class texting and checking your cell phone. Whether you are joining over Zoom
                  or in the physical classroom, I ask that you put mobile devices in Do Not Disturb
                  mode. While class is in progress, talking disruptively, leaving the classroom,
                  texting or using a cell phone or computer, reading a newspaper, or other
                  distracting behavior will be actively discouraged. </p>
               <h4>Covid and Attendance</h4>
               <p>When present on campus together this semester, whether in the classroom or
                  elsewhere, <em>always</em> wear a mask and wear it appropriately (over your mouth
                  and nose). We are being provided with some personal protective equipment (PPE) in
                  the form of plastic face shields to be worn <em>in addition to masks</em> if we
                  need to look at each other's computer screens. It is a good idea to bring hand
                  sanitizer with you to campus and sponge off your work area in class. I will ask
                  you to put on your mask if I see you without one, or to fix your mask if you are
                  not wearing it correctly. Non-compliance by any of us means we have to leave the
                  classroom immediately for our own safety, and I have to report anyone not masking
                  or distancing as a violation of the Student Code of Conduct. Remember, <em>My mask
                     protects you; your mask protects me.</em>
               </p>
               <p>Please do not attend our physical class if you are not feeling healthy! This is
                  not the semester to suffer through a fever or chills heroically to attend class in
                  person. Stay home, report symptoms, get tested. This applies to me as your
                  professor as well as to you!</p>
               <p> If you need to miss classes for health reasons, make arrangements with me and
                  your peers to catch up. We will always be meeting on line (via chat and GitHub
                  asynchronously and via Zoom for class meetings) and we will find ways to keep you
                  looped in.</p>
               <p><strong>Our Covid Mixed Mode</strong>: I am planning for the class to be meeting
                  in mixed ways, with some of you attending in Zoom and some of you in the
                  classroom. I hope we can maintain class meetings so we see each other in person
                  once per week before Thanksgiving, but we are ready to be fully remote when
                  needed. I am preparing much course material to be recorded and watched and read on
                  your own time. In-class meetings are paired with synchronized Zoom sessions so you
                  all, wherever you are, can talk to me live. Think of the in-class sessions as live
                  conversations where we share screens and discuss homework, tests, and
                  projects.</p>
               <p>Finally, if I feel as if we are risking our health with in-class meetings, I will
                  simply move us all to Zoom to protect our group. Our health comes first! </p>
               <h4>Student (and Faculty) Health and Wellness Services</h4>
               <p>If any of us, you students or me, are feeling sick, with COVID or flu-like, or
                  other serious ailments this semester, please contact Behrend Student Health &amp;
                  Wellness Services at <b>814-898-6217</b>. None of us can be sure what will happen
                  with the COVID pandemic, and we are taking on a great risk this semester.
                  Reporting in when you do not feel well is not shameful; it is responsible and
                  important to protect yourself and our community.</p>
               <p>Also, this semester may be more stressful than usual with so much uncertainty!
                  Many students at Penn State face personal challenges or have psychological needs
                  that may interfere with their academic progress, social development, or emotional
                  wellbeing. Seek help! The university offers a variety of confidential services to
                  help you through difficult times, including individual and group counseling,
                  crisis intervention, consultations, online chats, and mental health screenings.

               <h3>Equity</h3>
               <p>Penn State takes great pride to foster a diverse and inclusive environment for
                  students, faculty, and staff. Acts of intolerance, discrimination, or harassment
                  due to age, ancestry, color, disability, gender, gender identity, national origin,
                  race, religious belief, sexual orientation, or veteran status are not tolerated
                  and can be reported through Educational Equity via the Report Bias webpage (<a
                     href="http://equity.psu.edu/reportbias/"
                  >http://equity.psu.edu/reportbias/</a>).</p>
               <h3>E-mail:</h3>
               <p>Each student is issued a University email address (username@psu.edu) upon
                  admission. This email address may be used by the University for official
                  communication with students. Students are expected to read email sent to this
                  account on a regular basis. Failure to read and react to University communications
                  in a timely manner does not absolve the student from knowing and complying with
                  the content of the communications. The University provides an email forwarding
                  service that allows students to read their email via other service providers
                  (e.g., Hotmail, AOL, Yahoo). Students who choose to forward their email from their
                  psu.edu address to another address do so at their own risk. If email is lost as a
                  result of forwarding, it does not absolve the student from responding to official
                  communications sent to their University email address. To forward email sent to
                  your University account, go to http://accounts.psu.edu, log into your account,
                  click on Edit Forwarding Addresses, and follow the instructions on the page. Be
                  sure to log out of your account when you have finished. </p>
               <h3>Academic Integrity</h3>
               <p> Penn State Erie, The Behrend College, puts a very high value on academic
                  integrity, and violations are not tolerated. Academic integrity is the pursuit of
                  scholarly activity in an open, honest and responsible manner. Academic integrity
                  is a basic guiding principle for all academic activity at The Pennsylvania State
                  University, and all members of the University community are expected to act in
                  accordance with this principle. Consistent with this expectation, the University’s
                  Code of Conduct states that all students should act with personal integrity;
                  respect other students’ dignity, rights and property; and help create and maintain
                  an environment in which all can succeed through the fruits of their efforts.
                  Academic integrity includes a commitment by all members of the University
                  community not to engage in or tolerate acts of falsification, misrepresentation or
                  deception. Such acts of dishonesty violate the fundamental ethical principles of
                  the University community and compromise the worth of work completed by others.”
                  (Senate Policy 49-20 and G-9 Procedures. Any violation of academic integrity will
                  receive academic and possibly disciplinary sanctions, including the possible
                  awarding of an XF grade which is recorded on the transcript and states that
                  failure of the course was due to an act of academic dishonesty. All acts of
                  academic dishonesty are recorded so repeat offenders can be sanctioned
                  accordingly. More information on academic integrity can be found at: <a
                     href="http://psbehrend.psu.edu/intranet/faculty-resources/academic-integrity/academic-integrity"

               <p>
                  <strong>Source Citation and Plagiarism:</strong> One goal of our course is to
                  reflect on how best to cite sources in digital contexts. We will consider how and
                  why such citations differ from documenting printed texts. We will also consider
                  the ease and frequency with which digital texts and graphics are plagiarized on
                  the worldwide web, and discuss how the omission of source citations detracts from
                  the authority of a digital information resource. We expect you to practice mindful
                  source citation, and plagiarism on your part will have very serious consequences. </p>
               <p>Representing the voice of another individual as your own voice constitutes
                  plagiarism, however generous that person may be in “helping” you with an
                  assignment. Turning in an assignment generated collectively under the name of a
                  single individual is considered plagiarism. <strong>When instructed to collaborate
                     on a project, project collaborators share collective authorship and should
                     identify themselves directly as a team.</strong> To avoid plagiarism, cite your
                  sources whenever you quote, paraphrase, or summarize material, or use digital
                  images from any outside source (including websites, articles, books, course
                  readings, Courseweb or GitHub postings, or someone else’s notes). When using the
                  “copy” and “paste” features as you read and research, be sure that you are
                  carefully marking that these passages are unprocessed from their source, so that
                  you know to process it later. Forgetting to do so not only produces sloppy work
                  but (whether you intended it or not) results in a false representation. As long as
                  you make a good faith and clear effort to cite your sources, you will not be
                  faulted for plagiarism, but your work will be penalized if citations are
                  inaccurate, unclear, or lack important information. </p>
               <p>That said, the coding and digital development we do encourages collaboration, and
                  for that reason we adopt our colleague David Birnbaum's <a
                     href="http://dh.obdurodon.org/collaboration.xhtml">Collaboration policy</a>,
                  since his course is very similar to ours. This policy specifies that students
                  identify collaborators in a comment on submitted asignments and take care on
                  projects that all students contribute equally (and no student is contributing
                  excessively more than what everyone else has done). When joining a group homework
                  session, always work on the assignment by yourself first so you can be an equal
                  participant, and write up the assignment <em>by yourself, after</em> the session
                  is over so you take care not to copy from the other students. While we want you to
                  consult with each other, you are responsible for doing all your writing and coding
                  by yourself, using your own words. </p>
               <h3>Disability Services:</h3>
               <p>Penn State welcomes students with disabilities into the University’s educational
                  programs. Every Penn State campus has an office for students with disabilities.
                  Student Disability Resources (SDR) website provides contact information for every
                  Penn State campus (<a href="http://equity.psu.edu/sdr/disability-coordinator"
                     >http://equity.psu.edu/sdr/disability-coordinator</a>). For further
                  information, please visit Student Disability Resources website (<a
                     href="http://equity.psu.edu/sdr/disability-coordinator"
                     >http://equity.psu.edu/sdr/</a>). In order to receive consideration for
                  reasonable accommodations, you must contact the appropriate disability services
                  office at the campus where you are officially enrolled, participate in an intake
                  interview, and provide documentation: See documentation guidelines (<a
                     href="http://equity.psu.edu/sdr/guidelines"
                     >http://equity.psu.edu/sdr/guidelines</a>). If the documentation supports your
                  request for reasonable accommodations, your campus disability services office will
                  provide you with an accommodation letter. Please share this letter with your
                  instructors and discuss the accommodations with them as early as possible. You
                  must follow this process for every semester that you request accommodations. Penn
                  State Behrend’s Disability Services Coordinator is Stacey Walbridge (<a
