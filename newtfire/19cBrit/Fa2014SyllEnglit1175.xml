            <!--  <graphic url=""/>-->
            <p>This course in literary history spans a busy century in Britain from the 1790s to
               about 1900, a time of revolutionary transformation and rapid technological
               development. We’ll learn about the emergence of Britain’s Romantic Movement in its
               revolutionary historical context, and observe Romanticism’s lasting influence on the
               writers of the Victorian era, named for the long reign of Britain’s Queen Victoria.
               Writers of this time witnessed the development of public education systems and the
               transformation of publishing technology to accommodate increasing numbers of literate
               readers in England and across the expanding British empire. Aspiring poets and
               novelists vied with each other to reach larger and larger markets. Many British
               writers took seriously the idea that literature could help connect the rich and the
               poor, and their writings address very serious social issues of the rapidly
               modernizing nineteenth century. </p>
            <p>These writers still speak to issues of our times. They addressed controversies
               surrounding poverty, race relations, and women’s rights. They responded to scientific
               debates over geological discoveries, as well as new theories of sexual selection and
               survival of the fittest. They questioned humanity’s relation to nature, the way
               emotions influence thinking, and what might happen to Britons living among people of
               other cultures around the world. Over the next fifteen weeks, we will be discussing
               how nineteenth-century British writers challenged the social conventions of their
               times, and how they responded to the barriers of their time between wealth and
               poverty, men and women, Britons and foreigners, nation and empire, at a time when
               that empire stretched itself thin to span the world. Along the way we’ll consider why
               the "antique" ideas, images, structures, and stories of nineteenth-century Britain
               are still so appealing to many of us in the twenty-first century.</p>

            <p> Your grade will be based on Class Participation/Quizzes (10%), Weekly Logs and
               Response Papers (25%), Two Projects (total: 30%), two Midterm Exams (worth 10% each), and
               one Final Exam (15%). At least 90% of the work for the course must be completed in

               <head>Class Participation and Everyday Preparation: (10%)</head>
               <p>This portion of your grade reflects the extent to which you attend class regularly
                  and take an active role in class discussion, contributing thoughtful questions and
                  observations based on the readings, as well as responding to my questions. It will
                  also include your performance on any announced and unannounced quizzes and group
                  exercises I may give in class. If you keep up with the readings listed on the
                  schedule, and come to class each day prepared to discuss them, you will certainly
                  do well with this component.</p>
               <p> ** Note: Your attendance is vital to this course and your achievement in it. You
                  may miss three classes for any reason without penalty, but your participation
                  grade will be reduced for additional unexcused absences. You’ll also be missing
                  information and perspective on the readings that will almost certainly affect your
                  performance on assignments and exams. If you miss class, try to keep in touch with
                  other members of the class to find out what you’ve missed and consult with me to
                  help you catch up and to be sure you understand the material. Please note that
                  quizzes and in-class activities cannot be made up outside of the classes you

                  leaving the classroom, texting or using a cell phone or computer, reading a
                  newspaper, or other distracting behavior will be actively discouraged, and may

               <p><hi rend="em">Plagiarism</hi> falsely represents another source’s words or ideas

                  final course grade of F and be reported to the Vice President of Academic Affairs.
                  Representing the voice of another individual as your own voice constitutes
                  plagiarism, however generous that person may be in "helping" you with an
                  assignment. <hi rend="em">To avoid plagiarism,</hi> cite your sources whenever you
                  quote, paraphrase, or summarize material, or use digital images from any outside
                  source (including websites, articles, books, course readings, Courseweb postings,
                  or someone else’s notes). Turning in an assignment generated collectively under
                  the name of a single individual is considered plagiarism. When instructed to
                  collaborate on a project, project collaborators share collective authorship and
                  should identify themselves directly as a team. When using the "copy" and "paste"
                  features as you read and research, be sure that you are carefully marking that
                  these passages are unprocessed from their source, so that you know to process it
                  later. Forgetting to do so not only produces sloppy work but (whether you intended
                  it or not) results in a false representation. As long as you make a good faith and
                  clear effort to cite your sources, you will not be faulted for plagiarism, but

                  <p>Each student is issued a University email address (username@pitt.edu) upon
                     admission. This email address may be used by the University for official
                     communication with students. Students are expected to read email sent to this
                     account on a regular basis. Failure to read and react to University
                     communications in a timely manner does not absolve the student from knowing and
                     complying with the content of the communications. The University provides an
                     email forwarding service that allows students to read their email via other
                     service providers (e.g., Hotmail, AOL, Yahoo). Students who choose to forward
                     their email from their pitt.edu address to another address do so at their own
                     risk. If email is lost as a result of forwarding, it does not absolve the
                     student from responding to official communications sent to their University
                     email address. To forward email sent to your University account, go to
                     http://accounts.pitt.edu, log into your account, click on Edit Forwarding
                     Addresses, and follow the instructions on the page. Be sure to log out of your
                     account when you have finished. (For the full Email Communication Policy, go to

                        <item> <note>Explain what text you're going to research, which option you're choosing, and specifically what you're investigating in the text you're discussing (so you're not just using my language on the assignment sheet, but explaining how you're responding to the assignment option).</note> </item>

Please do NOT include links into the databases because they do not work and just create a mess. Instead, simply indicate the name of the library database (e.g. Project Muse or JSTOR, or 19th-century UK Periodicals) in which you found the article. </note></item>

I'll either approve your topic or ask you to return to the "drawing board"--with some advice and questions to help. I may also send you to some good sources to consult, so this should be a useful process for you to get a strong and prompt start on your paper. </note>
