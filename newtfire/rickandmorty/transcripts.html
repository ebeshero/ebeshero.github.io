                <h2>TRANSCRIPTS</h2>
                <p>These are the transcribed episodes we used to pull our data from. We've made them available on the site solely for the purposes of providing a better and more expansive amount of transcription than those already available (via the Rick and Morty Wiki Page).</p>
                <p>Right now, the toggle box highlights stage directions and speakers. In the future, we'd like to parse through the transcript files and seperate each individual speaker so we can highlight lines by speaker.</p>

He glances up at the clones, then covers his eyes as he hits a button on the wall, creating an energy field that destroys the clones, whose faces seem to melt. Morty watches, horrified. As soon as they're gone, Rick jumps to his feet and grabs the device that absorbed the spirits, apparently unbothered by the entire event.</span>

Second of all, cards on the table: I am a murderer that eats babies and I came to this planet to eat babies. However, I am also carrying a highly infectious disease, that I suppose you could call ‘space aids’ as you put it, and Rick did chain me up so that he could attempt to cure it. At the same time, Rick’s motivation to cure my disease was not to save my life or anyone else’s, but to patent and sell the cure for billions of blemflarks. But you know the reason why I ripped my chains out of the wall? And do you know why I’m never coming back to this planet? Because the two of you are the fucking worst! You both hate yourselves and each other! And the idea that it has anything to do with Rick is laughable! I’d laugh but I’m biologically incapable, that’s how alien I am! And even I’m sitting here listening to the two of you, and being like, what the fuck! So! Good luck with your shitty marriage, and I’m sorry that Rick has to deal with either of you.

He pulls a frozen alien creature out of the drawers and brings it to life with a flask of chemicals, strokes it while it shrieks helplessly, and drinks the rest of the chemicals. He puts one of the bulbs into the contraption and sticks the alien under it, disintegrating it with a blast of energy, then replaces the bulb and repeats the process with his own head. At the last second, he falls unconscious, dodging the killing blast. The screen zooms out through the open garage door, showing Rick slumped still on the desk through the night and into the morning, even as Jerry shows up, happily weeding the garden and the driveway without noticing Rick.)</span>

Also, why is the string attached to it running through a pair of scissors attached to a timer? And why is the time set to 10 minutes from now, exactly when we would have left for therapy?</span>
      </p>

      <p class="sp">
         <span class="speaker">Pickle Rick</span>

Because I invent, transform, create, and destroy for a living, and when I don't like something about the world, I change it.
And I don't think going to a rented office in a strip mall to listen to some agent of averageness explain which words mean which feelings has ever helped anyone do anything.
I think it's helped a lot of people get comfortable and stop panicking, which is a state of mind we value in the animals we eat, but not something I want for myself.
I'm not a cow.
I'm a pickle When I feel like it.
So you asked.</span>
      </p>

      <p class="sp">
         <span class="speaker">Dr. Wong</span>
         <span class="speech">: Rick, the only connection between your unquestionable intelligence and the sickness destroying your family is that everyone in your family, you included, use intelligence to justify sickness.
You seem to alternate between viewing your own mind as an unstoppable force and as an inescapable curse.
And I think it's because the only truly unapproachable concept for you is that it's your mind within your control.
You chose to come here, you chose to talk to belittle my vocation, just as you chose to become a pickle.
You are the master of your universe, and yet you are dripping with rat blood and feces.
Your enormous mind literally vegetating by your own hand.
I have no doubt that you would be bored senseless by therapy, the same way I'm bored when I brush my teeth and wipe my ass.
Because the thing about repairing, maintaining, and cleaning is it's not an adventure.
There's no way to do it so wrong you might die.
It's just work.
And the bottom line is, some people are okay going to work, and some people well, some people would rather die.
Each of us gets to choose.
That's our time.
I'm going to give you guys my card and hope to hear from you again.
And if you have any friends or family that eat poop and would like to stop, give them my number.</span>

         <span class="speech">:   Yeah, it hardly matters now, sweetie. You know, smart people get a chance to climb on top, take reality for a ride, but it’ll never stop trying to throw you. And, eventually, it will. There’s no other way off.</span>

         <span class="speaker">Beth</span>

      <p class="sp">
         <span class="speaker">Rick</span>
         <span class="speech">: I can make a clone of you, a perfect instance of you, with all your memories. An exact copy in every way. It’ll love and provide for the kids, do your job, and consume broadcast-network reality TV on the same allegedly ironic level as you. You could be gone a day, a week, or the rest of your life with zero consequences. The moment you decide to come back, I flip a switch, and the clone’s job is done. It feels no pain, it regrets nothing, and has zero chance of going "Blade Runner."</span>

      <p class="sp">
         <span class="speaker">Rick</span>
         <span class="speech">:  Huh, and I’m an elderly man. And we appear to be in some kind of secret confined space.Yeah, umm Don’t look at me like that. For all we know, you could be the [BLEEP] weirdo. Huh, these things are obviously storage units, and since we can’t remember what went wrong, my guess is that the technology involves memory, and that this thing on your head is designed to  Tell us the code, jagoff! It’s pointless. He’s stonewalling.</span>

      <p class="sp">
         <span class="speaker">Morty</span>

      <p class="sp">
         <span class="speaker">Morty</span>
         <span class="speech">:  Yeah, well, I crossed every line I had when this bastard tried to kill Jessica! </span>

      <p class="sp">
         <span class="speaker">Rick</span>

      </p>

      <p class="sp">
         <span class="speaker">Morty</span>

      </p>

      <p class="sp">
         <span class="speaker">Morty</span>
         <span class="speech">:  I thought I was torturing him! </span>
      </p>

      <p class="sp">
         <span class="speaker">Rick</span>
         <span class="speech">:  Oh, and this disappoints you? Do I tell him we don’t have a deal, Morty? Because if we can kill our enemies, but we can’t jack them off, then how are we better than them? </span>
      </p>

      <p class="sp">
         <span class="speaker">Morty</span>
         <span class="speech">:  Well, what did you find out? We’re partners, I guess, and we fight aliens, like "Men in Black"? </span>
      </p>

      <p class="sp">
         <span class="speaker">Rick</span>
         <span class="speech">:  "Men in Black," "Men in Black." I have "Men in Black 2" in here.</span>

      </p>

      <p class="sp">
         <span class="speaker">Rick</span>

         <span class="speech">:  All right, save it for Youtube.I’ll keep looking for clues.</span>
      </p>

         <span class="speech">:  What are you doing? </span>
      </p>

      <p class="sp">
         <span class="speaker">Morty</span>
         <span class="speech">:  You want your shelf level or not? </span>
      </p>

      <p class="sp">
         <span class="speaker">Rick</span>
         <span class="speech">:  And if I say yes, you’re gonna provide that for me with that? </span>
      </p>

      <p class="sp">
         <span class="speaker">Morty</span>
         <span class="speech">:  Yes, see the bubble? </span>
      </p>

      <p class="sp">
         <span class="speaker">Rick</span>
         <span class="speech">:  I’m familiar with the bubble, Morty. I also dabble in precision, and if you think you can even approach it with your sad, naked, caveman eyeball and a bubble of [BLEEP] air, you’re the reason this species is a failure, and it makes me angry! </span>
      </p>

      <p class="sp">
         <span class="speaker">Morty</span>
         <span class="speech">:  You’re drunk.</span>
      </p>

      <p class="sp">
         <span class="speaker">Rick</span>
         <span class="speech">:  You want to put up a shelf, put up a shelf You want to experience true level? Do you? </span>
      </p>

      <p class="sp">
         <span class="speaker">Morty</span>
         <span class="speech">:  Y-yes.</span>
      </p>

      <p class="sp">
         <span class="speaker">Rick</span>
         <span class="speech">:  Ugh, all right, come on.</span>
      </p>

      <p class="sp">
         <span class="speaker">Morty</span>
         <span class="speech">:  Wow, it’s so Oh, oh, oh, oh, my God, oh, Christ, ooh, ooh, ooh, ahh.</span>

      </p>

      <p class="sp">
         <span class="speaker">Morty</span>
         <span class="speech">:  Oh, everything’s crooked! Reality is poison! I want to go back! I hate this! </span>
      </p>

      <p class="sp">
         <span class="speaker">Summer</span>

      </p>

      <p class="sp">
         <span class="speaker">Morty</span>
         <span class="speech">:  Can’t live like this! Shh, shh, shh, shh, Morty, Morty, Morty.</span>
      </p>

      <p class="sp">
         <span class="speaker">Rick</span>

      </p>

      <p class="sp">
         <span class="speaker">Morty</span>
         <span class="speech">:  Well? You seem to be in charge of what I get to remember. Why? </span>
      </p>

      <p class="sp">
         <span class="speaker">Rick</span>
         <span class="speech">:  Good question. Morty, I need darkness to prime these optical inductors. Hit the leftmost light switch by the door for me. The left. Okay, lights on. So, did I just hear three distinct light switch clicks? </span>
      </p>

      <p class="sp">
         <span class="speaker">Morty</span>
         <span class="speech">:  W-W-What do you mean? </span>
      </p>

      <p class="sp">
         <span class="speaker">Rick</span>
         <span class="speech">:  I feel like the three sounds I heard could be explained by an initial erroneous flipping of a switch on the right followed by a hasty, corrective flipping of the requested switch. Then during the resultant darkness and silence, a third, shameful unflipping of the initially flipped switch. Is my assessment accurate? </span>
      </p>

      <p class="sp">
         <span class="speaker">Morty</span>
         <span class="speech">:  Yeah, that’s that’s basically how how it all shaked out. I’m sorry.</span>
      </p>

      <p class="sp">
         <span class="speaker">Rick</span>
