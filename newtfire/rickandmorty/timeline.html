                <h2>Timeline of Culture References in the Rick and Morty Shorts</h2>
                <p>Justin Roiland, the co-creator of Rick and Morty said, "I was like, 'No time
                    travel.' The designs are reminiscent, but psychologically, I perceive them as
                    something completely different from their origins." In each episode, Rick and
                    Morty travel DIMENSIONALLY.</p>

                <p>We all know that it was NOT time travel that allowed Rick to get Szechuan Sauce
                    from McDonald's or when he got pizza for dinner in seconds. He went to a
                    dimension where these things existed in the present!}</p>

                <p>We decided it would be fun to track the time travel of the show through the
                    cultural references to see where in time Rick and Morty might be in each episode
                    -- since they are NOT time traveling! These are the side by side timelines of
                    the shorts and the episodes with the year of release of each cultural
                    reference.</p>
