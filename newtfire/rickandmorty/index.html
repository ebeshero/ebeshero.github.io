                <h2>THE RICK AND MORTY PROJECT</h2>
                <h2 style="font-size: 55px;text-align:left;">About the Project</h2>
                <p>This project was created by Dorothea Lint and Ally Hall at the University of
                    Pittsburgh at Greensburg for the Digital Humanities Coding and data
                    Visualization class. Its purpose is to take the transcribed versions of the
                    episodes from all seasons of the show, clean up the format including adding
                    missing elements and xml markup, and extract data based on several research
                    questions, such as "Where in time are the cultural references that the episodes
                    are based on? Is there any pattern or cluster in these references that can be
                    discerned from gathering them in one space?" and "What are the dimensional rules
                    for Mortys in relating to Ricks based on the idea that every Rick has a
                    Morty?"</p>
                <h2 style="font-size: 55px;text-align:left;">About the Team</h2>
                <p>Dorothea Lint is a student at the University of Pittsburgh at Greensburg,
                    majoring in English Literarure, minoring in Psychology, and pursuing the Digital
                    Humanities Certificate. Employed as an Independent Contractor for 16 years, in
                    her spare time she reads, rescues cats, loves intellectual shows like Rick and
                    Morty, and has realized while submitting this write-up that she just may be the
                    most uninteresting person in the world!</p>

                <p>Ally Hall is also a student at the University of Pittsburgh at Greensburg
                    majoring in Science Journalism and Computer Science. She enjoys web design,
                    physics, science fiction, and her two pet birds. She hasn't seen Rick and Morty
                    before, so working on this project was a welcome challenge!</p>
