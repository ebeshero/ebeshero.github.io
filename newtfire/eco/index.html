            <h4> Famous Quotes about Climate Change </h4>
        
        <span class="quote">
           
            "Tenty-five years ago people could be excused for not knowing much                           or doing much, about climate change. Today we have no excuse." -- Desmond Tutu<br> <br> 

            
            "If you really think that the environment is less important than the economy, try holding your breath while you count your money." -- Guy McPherson <br> <br> 
            
            
            "I'm often asked whether I believe in global warming. I now just reply with the question: Do you believe in gravity?" -- Neil deGrasse Tyson<br> <br> 
            
            
            "We are the first generation to feel the sting of climate change, and we are the last generation that can do something about it." -- Jay Inslee<br> <br> 
            
         
         "We do not inherit the earth from our ancestors, we borrow it from our children." -- Native American Proverb<br>

			              Across the burning Amazon, smoke is rising and fine particles of charcoal are falling softly to the ground.<br>
At last count, more than 93,000 fires were alight in the Brazilian Amazon, up more than 60 percent from the<br>
same time last year, and the highest number since 2010. According to NASA, this year’s fires are more intensethan in previous years, too.<br>
But Brazil’s National Institute of Space Research (INPE) has only been keeping fire records since 1998, and<br>
two decades isn’t long in the life of a forest where trees live for centuries and humans have been setting <br>
fires for millennia.

    In terms of climate change
	  Cutting trees both adds carbon dioxide to the air and removes the ability to absorb <br>
existing carbon dioxide. If tropical deforestation were a country, according to the World Resources Institute, <br>
it would rank third in carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions, behind China and the U.S.<br>
The numbers are grim, but many conservationists see reasons for hope. A movement is under way to preserve existing<br>
forest ecosystems
and restore lost tree cover.
