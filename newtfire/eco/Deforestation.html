       <h2> Brazil's Deforestation Problem</h2>
        <h4>Brazil to plug an important gap in the Amazon deforestation story, and prevent a reversal <br/>
            of the decline in deforestation rates. There are at least eight different processes underway <br/>
            in the Brazilian Amazon region that are designed to slow deforestation. However, these processes <br/>
            use different metrics of success, they operate with different spatial scales and over different <br/>
            time periods, and they are severely
            deficient in positive incentives for farmers who are doing their part to slow deforestation. <br/>

        <h2> The Forest</h2>
        <h4>The forest also influences the water cycle on a regional and perhaps even global scale.<br/>
            As moisture comes off the Atlantic Ocean it falls on the forest as rain. This water gets <br/>
            sucked up by deep roots, then moves through plants and across the surface of leaves before returning <br/>
            to the atmosphere. Winds blowing over the uneven forest canopy create turbulence, which allows the atmosphere <br/>
            to absorb more moisture. All this water then moves like a giant flowing river in the sky, falling as rain and then evaporating <br/>
            again and again until it reaches the Andes. Ultimately, the forest produces at least half of its own rain.. <br/>
