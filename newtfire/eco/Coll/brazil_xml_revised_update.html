         Climbing soy prices, the end to some of the voluntary agreements that helped
         slow <span class="problem">deforestaion </span> (such as the Soy Moratorium), and a shortage of <span class="problem">cattle pasture</span> suitable for
         conversion to <span class="problem">soy</span>, could come together to drive <span class="problem">deforestation</span> rates back up. In 2013, for
         example, <span class="problem"></span> was 28% higher than in 2012.

         Earth Innovation Institute, together with
         partner organizations, has been leading a multi-sector dialogue in Brazil to plug
         an important
         gap in the Amazon <span class="problem">deforestation</span> story, and prevent a reversal of the decline in <span class="problem">deforestation</span>
         rates. There are at least eight different processes underway in the <span class="place">Brazilian Amazon</span> region that
         are designed to slow <span class="problem">deforestation</span>. However, these processes use different metrics of success,
         they operate with different spatial scales and over different time periods, and they
         are
         severely deficient in positive incentives for farmers who are doing their part to
         slow
         <span class="problem">deforestation</span>. In other words, <span class="problem">deforestation</span> strategies are being discussed in many different
         “languages”, creating an important obstacle to the convergence that will be needed
         to continue
         the recent trend towards lower <span class="problem">deforestation</span>. The “Multi-Sector Deforestation Agreement for the
         Amazon” is designed to help achieve this convergence. It establishes a set of incremental
         milestones for <span class="solution">reducing deforestation</span> through 2020, when the decline in <span class="problem">deforestation</span> will
         achieve 90% below the ten-year average and when all clearing of primary forest would
         be 90%
         below the historical average and would be compensated by new natural forest.
