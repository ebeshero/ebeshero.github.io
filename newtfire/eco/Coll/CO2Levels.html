         <span class="sectionHead">  intro<br></br></span> 
         <span class="problem">The world’s existing power plants, industrial equipment, vehicles and other CO₂-emitters
            are on track to pump out enough carbon dioxide
            by midcentury to blow past that target, researchers report July 1 in Nature.  Add
            in future power plants that are already planned, 
            permitted or under construction, and we could emit enough by 2033 to raise <span class="extent">  average global atmospheric temperatures by 1.5 degrees, the researchers say.  
               If we want to limit warming to 1.5 degrees, then “we cannot invest more in fossil
               fuel power or infrastructure,” says Thorsten</span> 
            Mauritsen, a physical climate scientist at  Stockholm University  who was not involved with the work. “Everything we do from now has
            to change direction and not use fossil fuels.” </span>

         In the 2015 <span class="place">Paris</span> Agreement on climate change, nearly all the world’s nations agreed to try to reduce
         greenhouse gas emissions 
         enough to limit warming to “well below” 2 degrees by 2100 (SN: 1/9/16, p. 6). <span class="place">The United States </span> has said it would pull out of the
         agreement (SN Online: 6/1/17), though the exit wouldn’t be complete until 2020.
         Still, calls have increased since 2015 for the more ambitious goal of keeping warming
         to 1.5 degrees. <span class="problem"> That would mean fewer heat waves, 
            spells of extreme weather and species extinctions (SN: 10/27/18, p. 7).</span>
         <span class="problem">   <span class="cause"> Human activity has already increased global temperatures by 1 degree.</span> Emitting an additional 420 to 580 gigatons of CO2 could warm the
            planet to 1.5 degrees above preindustrial levels,</span>   the  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  estimated in 2018. Current infrastructure 
         could emit that much CO2 between 2018 and as early as 2035, though it could take until
         2046 to reach those totals, the new study found.
         <span class="problem">Existing infrastructure, over its expected lifetime, <span class="extent">would emit about 658 gigatons of CO2, say Steven Davis, an earth systems scientist
               
               at the University of California, Irvine, and his colleagues.</span>  About 41 percent of those emissions would come from <span class="place">China</span> , 9 percent from the 
            <span class="place"> United States </span>and 7 percent from the <span class="place"> European Union.</span></span>
         
         
      </p>
      <p>         <span class="sectionHead"> global emissions <br></br></span> 
         <span class="problem">Those expected global emissions rise to about 850 gigatons when proposed power plants
            are included. That’s enough to hit the 1.5 degree budget 
            by 2033, and makes up roughly two-thirds of the 1,170 to 1,500 gigatons of CO2 to
            reach 2 degrees of warming.
            “This analysis … lends some concrete context to what a 1.5 degree target would mean,”
            Davis says.</span> <span class="solution"> These targets that get 
            bandied about are very ambitious” and will require more than a few solar power projects
            and incremental emissions reductions, he says.</span> 
         Nearly 10 years ago, Davis and some colleagues performed a census of CO2–emitting
         infrastructure. <span class="solution"> The new study updates that census to 
            include all known CO2 sources at the end of 2018, including power plants and industrial
            emitters, such as cement kilns, as well as transportation
            sources such as airplanes and vehicles. The update also accounts for shifts in greenhouse
            gas emissions caused by things such as the U.S. natural
            gas boom and <span class="place">China’s</span> burgeoning economy.</span> The resulting calculation is how much CO2 is “committed” to be created, unless policy
         or technology triggers change.
         <span class="solution">The calculations don’t consider current and future efforts to mitigate emissions,
            for example by expanding renewable energy sources. Nor do the
            results account for projected emissions increases in developing economies.</span>
         This work also doesn’t consider other sectors, for instance agriculture, which contributes
         methane, a potent greenhouse gas, says Joeri Rogelj,
         a climate scientist at Imperial College London in England   who was not involved with the work. Still, he says, the results should serve as
         a wake-up call. 
         “This should not be seen as a fatalistic prediction of what will happen,” Roelj says.
         But it’s a “strong call to ensure that we make choices that
         reduce the carbon impact of what is currently in the pipeline.”
