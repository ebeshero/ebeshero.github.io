         Only a few years ago, it looked as if global emissions had plateaued and had perhaps
         even peaked, and many hoped that the world
         had started down the long, hard journey toward weaning itself off carbon-based energy.
         <span class="problem">Over the past decade, renewable energy use 
            did indeed expand dramatically—but so did the burning of oil, gas, and even coal.
            That growth outstripped any carbon-neutralizing
            gains from renewables.</span>
         There's a limit­—a budget, essentially—to how much carbon dioxide we can release and
         still avoid a level of climate chaos that 
         would fundamentally transform modern life. And we're increasingly at risk of blowing
         right past it.
         <span class="problem">"We are at a pivotal point in the history of human civilization on our planet,"</span> says Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist at Texas
         Tech University and one of the authors of the U.S. government's recent National Climate Assessment. 
         As international leaders gather at the COP24 meeting this week to once again push
         for a climate-friendlier future, they are faced with
         the reality that the world is still moving in the wrong direction. And the need for
         change grows more urgent by the day.
         To get where we need to go, "we need all hands on deck," Hayhoe says.
         Or, as one German researcher put it, we need "love, rage, and imagination."

         <span class="sectionHead">Unmistakable signs <br></br></span>
         Just in the last few months, scientists have unveiled a slew of new reports that lay
         out how significantly climate change has altered
         the globe—and how much worse it can get.
         "We know what's coming down the pike,” says Kim Cobb, a climate scientist at the Georgia Institute of Technology, “because part of it isalready here.”
         <span class="problem">Hurricanes such as Maria and Harvey were stronger and more damaging, and intensified
            more swiftly thanks to <span class="cause">soaring temperatures.</span>Rising oceans now lap at the foot of Texas’s
            coastal oil refineries and<span class="place"> New York City’s</span>  <span class="place">water treatment facilities.</span></span>
         Ocean heat waves are wiping out coral reefs and fueling toxic, deadly algal blooms.
         Heat waves on land last longer than they used to,  sparking drought and feeding wildfires
         like the savage blazes
         that killed at least 85 people in California in November.
         The problem can seem intractable and confusing. But out of the deluge of data, a simple
         truth emerges:<span class="solution"> To keep warming from wreaking too much
            havoc on the planet, we must put hard limits on how much more carbon dioxide collects
            in the atmosphere. And just cutting carbon out of our 
            daily lives and economy probably won’t be enough: To keep climate change in check,
            we will also have to suck some of that carbon back out of the atmosphere.</span>
         
      </p>
      <p>
         <span class="sectionHead">The budget game <br></br></span>
         At heart, it's a simple budget exercise.
         <span class="problem">
            Scientists know roughly how much each belch of CO2 from a truck, coal plant, or decomposing
            tree warms the planet. T
            hey know how packed full of greenhouse gases the atmosphere is already. By setting
            a desired temperature “cap,” they
            can figure out how much more we can release. That is our carbon budget.
            Coal-fired power plants are still emitting vast quantities of carbon dioxide each
            year.
            </span>
         
         The size of the budget depends on the target. In 2015, signatories to the <span class="place"> Paris </span> Accord agreed to limit warming to 2 degrees
         Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) by 2100. But many scientists maintained even then
         that holding warming to 1.5 degrees C (2.7 degrees F) 
         would be far safer.
         <span class="problem">to limit temperature to 1.5 degrees, the total amount of carbon dioxide left to emit—by
            everyone, ever, around the world—is 580 billion metric tons. For scale, 
            's as if you covered <span class="place">California</span>, <span class="place">Nevada</span>, and <span class="place">Arizona</span> in a blanket of coal as tall as a person. That’s all we’ve got left to burn.
            And if we barrel ahead at the rate we’re going now, we'd deplete that carbon budget
            in less than 15 year
            </span> 
         
      </p>
      <p>
         <span class="sectionHead">The love and rage solution <br></br></span>
         To avoid that fate, an October report by the  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change proposes that the world reduce carbon emissions to 
         zero by 2050. Many countries, states, and cities have adopted that goal. Just last
         week, the European Union <span class="problem">—collectively responsible for 10 
            percent of global emissions—laid out its own plan for reaching that target. </span>
         Globally, however, hitting that goal won't be easy. Today's report shows emissions
         are expected to jack up 2.7 percent in 2018. And many positive gains from the past
         few years seemed to evaporate: 
         The <span class="place"> US </span> backslid on  fossil fuel use, posting an increase in emissions this year after a
         decade of decline. <span class="problem"> Oil use, too, is on 
            the rise around the world after a dip that many hopedwould be permanent--even as the
            number of electric vehicles doubled to <span class="extent">4 million in the last two years.
               Even in a progressive country like France, riots just this week forced Prime Minister
               Édouard Philippe to suspend a rise in the gasoline tax</span>  </span> 
         And even if we meet those goals, it's almost certainly impossible to limit warming
         to 1.5 degrees without also grabbing carbon from the 
         Still, it's important to not get discouraged, Cobb says. We can't afford to just throw
         up our hand
         <span class="problem"> “From scientific perspective, this is not a pass-fail class,” says Cobb. “It's never
            too late—but the sooner we act, the better.”
            </span>
         Late last month, Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber, the founding director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Research  in <span class="place">Germany</span>, tried to summarize what's necessary.
         <span class="solution"> "We need something like love, rage, and imagination," he told the German radio network
            Deutschlandfunk. "Love for our fellow humans and for coming generations and other
            creatures. We need rage as well,
            to stop the game played by some businesses. And we need a whole lot of scientific
            and technical imagination, maybe artistic imagination too. The mix of all that could
            actually do it."</span>
         The third part, imagination—that's what National Geographic plans to focus on in our
         upcoming climate coverage.
         <span class="solution">In the coming months we'll be looking at engineering and ecological approaches to
            taking carbon back out of the atmosphere, at tipping points 
            in the climate system that make the task more urgent, and at ways that communities
            around the world are already adapting to the change that 
            is upon us—and that we're all going to be adapting to for a long time.</span>
