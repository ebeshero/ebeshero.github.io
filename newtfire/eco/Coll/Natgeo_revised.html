         When Jair Bolsonaro, a 63-year-old retired <span class="place">Brazilian</span> military officer, took the helm in January of a country that manages 1.5 million
         square miles of the Amazon, the risks to <span class="problem">wildlife</span> and indigenous tribal communities were hotly debated. With Bolsonaro's plans, <span class="problem">deforestation</span> rates in <span class="place">Brazil</span> could quickly triple, according to an assessment by scientists. But the consequences
         of Bolsonaro's policies also are being felt far beyond areas hit by <span class="problem">chainsaws.</span> Even modest increases in <span class="problem">deforestation</span> <span class="problem">could affect water supplies in Brazilian cities</span> and in neighboring countries while harming the very farms he is trying to expand.
         <span class="problem">More massive deforestation might alter water supplies as far away as Africa or California.
            </span>        
         Most troubling of all:<span class="problem"> Some scientists suggest the <span class="place">Amazon</span> may already be nearing a tipping point.</span> <span class="problem">The region has been so degraded that even a small uptick in deforestation could send
            the forest hurtling toward a transition to something resembling a woodland savanna</span>, according to an analysis last year by two top scientists. <span class="problem">In addition to forever destroying huge sections of the world's largest rainforest</span>, that shift would release tremendous quantities of planet-warming greenhouse gases,
         which could hasten the decline of whatever forest remained.
         
         "We are already in a very critical situation in terms of climate change," says Adriane
         Esquivel-Muelbert, a native Brazilian who studies tropical forests at the University
         of Leeds in the United Kingdom. She's the lead author on <span class="problem">a study published last November showing that the mix of tree species across the forest
            is already shifting in response to rising temperatures.
            </span>        
         "If we mess up with the <span class="place">Amazon,</span> <span class="problem">carbon dioxide emissions will increase so massively that everyone will suffer,</span>" she adds.
         
         By some accounts, it could happen quite fast.
         
         The rainforest creates rain
         Bolsonaro, a former right-wing congressman from <span class="place">Rio de Janeiro,</span> soundly defeated a former mayor of <span class="place">São Paulo</span> in Brazil's presidential election late last year. The populist president is so openly
         hostile to his country's established order that some call him "Tropical Trump."
         
         His rise comes at a perilous moment for the Amazon.
         
         From poison dart frogs and giant anteaters to golden lion tamarins and stinging bullet
         ants, the <span class="place">South American rainforest</span> is the most species-rich biome on <span class="place">Earth,</span> with more diverse plant life in a single acre than may be found in many American
         states. It is home to 10 percent of the world's species, including 2.5 million species
         of insect.
         
         The forest also influences the water cycle on a regional and perhaps even global scale.
         As moisture comes off the <span class="place">Atlantic Ocean</span> it falls on the forest as rain. This water gets sucked up by deep roots, then moves
         through plants and across the surface of leaves before returning to the atmosphere.
         Winds blowing over the uneven forest canopy create turbulence, which allows the atmosphere
         to absorb more moisture.
         
         All this water then moves like a giant flowing river in the sky, falling as rain and
         then evaporating again and again until it reaches the <span class="place">Andes.</span> Ultimately, the forest produces at least half of its own rain.
         
         "One water vapor molecule may be recycled five to seven times before it leaves the
         system, either through the atmosphere or the <span class="place">Amazon River,</span>" says Carlos Nobre, a climate scientist with the University of <span class="place">São Paulo's Institute for Advanced Studies.</span>
         
         <span class="problem">But experts increasingly fear this delicate exchange could collapse. The loss of just
            a fraction more of this moisture-creating forest could lead far more of it to dry
            out, which would reduce rainfall even more, in a self-reinforcing spiral.</span> Already, climate change, decades of logging, and <span class="problem">land-clearing by intentionally set wildfires have sparked record-setting droughts
            in 2005, 2010, and 2015-2016.</span>
         
         "That suggests the system is flickering," says Thomas Lovejoy, a <span class="place">George Mason University</span> professor and senior fellow at the United Nations Foundation, who is widely considered the godfather of biodiversity studies.
         
         Lovejoy and Nobre recently tried to estimate how close to the edge the <span class="place">Amazon</span> really is. Their projection, published as an editorial in Science Advances, suggests
         that in the most susceptible parts of the rainforest—the <span class="place">southern, eastern and central Amazon</span>—<span class="problem">loss of as little as 20 to 25 percent of original forestland</span> could tip the system into an unstoppable transition to a drier, savanna-like ecosystem.
         
         Already, by the Brazilian government's own estimates, 17 percent of the Amazon forest system has been lost—not including
         the parts that are still largely intact, but degraded.
         
         How likely is the scenario Lovejoy describes?
         
         "It's not something we know with any confidence, but it's a possibility—and not just
         a crazy, harebrained possibility. It's a very real one," says Abigail L. S. Swann,
         a <span class="place">University of Washington</span> eco-climatologist who is contributing to a chapter on abrupt landscape changes for
         the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's next assessment.
         
         While no one knows precisely where the Amazon’s tipping point may lie, "it makes no
         sense at all to discover the tipping point by actually tipping over it," Lovejoy says.
         
         The forest is changing already
         Even as Bolsonaro pushes his new policies, the <span class="place">Amazon</span> is already changing.
         
         The dry season is lengthening and rainfall has dropped by a quarter in some regions.<span class="problem"> Meanwhile, precipitation, when it comes, sometimes arrives in more intense bursts,
            leading to massive floods in 2009, 2012, and 2014. The region's climate system is
            oscillating more wildly.</span>
         
         In the study she led, published in the journal Global Change Biology with more than
         a hundred other scientists as co-authors, Esquivel-Muelbert found that during the
         past 30 years, more drought-tolerant plant species have appeared in the <span class="place">Amazon,</span> while species that predominantly emerge in wet areas are declining. Fast-growing
         trees and taller trees that are better at accessing the sun are outcompeting shorter,
         damp-loving species.
         
         Another study shows <span class="problem">the rate of tree deaths is increasing.</span>
         
         It's not clear whether all this is the beginning of the shift Lovejoy and Nobre predicted—or
         something else. "But it's still important because the species are beginning to change,
         and that can change how the forest behaves," Esquivel-Muelbert says.
         
         How will that change the interactions among tens of thousands of species within the
         jungle? No one yet knows.
         
         "It's sending ripples through the system, and we have no idea where they are going
         to lead," Lovejoy says. "It could become a much simpler ecosystem, and what that means
         in terms of its overall stability is a real question."
         
         If Lovejoy is right, and <span class="problem">heat and deforestation lead to less rain and a transition to a different type of landscape,
            consequences will be felt far and wide.</span>
         
         Expanding ripples
         For starters, it's impossible to quantify the true value of lost diversity. In one
         recent review, a team found evidence that 381 new types of plants or animals had been
         discovered in the <span class="place">Amazon</span> during a single two-year period from 2014 to 2015—the equivalent of one new species
         every other day.
         
         "It's kind of a cliché that the cure for cancer might be in the Amazon, but it's also
         kind of true," Esquivel-Muelbert says.
         
         Moisture from the <span class="place">Amazon</span> also nourishes the winter rains that supply <span class="place">Uruguay,</span> <span class="place">northern Argentina</span> and <span class="place">Paraguay</span> with water. The recent drought that led to water shortages in <span class="place">São Paulo,</span> Brazil’s largest city, were likely exacerbated by rainforest shifts.
         
         In some places, rainfall in the <span class="place">Amazon</span> also helps supply water to the very soy farmers and beef ranchers who are clearing
         the forest. Brazilian agriculture, it seems, actually needs the <span class="place">Amazon.</span>
         
         "We need to have forest in order to have the rain necessary to plant crops," Esquivel-Muelbert
         says.
         
         Massive deforestation of the Amazon could change weather outside <span class="place">South America</span> as well. Because water vapor heats the air as it condenses high in the sky to form
         liquid raindrops, a significant reduction in rain caused by deforestation would actually
         cool the atmosphere above the region. <span class="problem">That cooling perturbation would leave the southern hemisphere in atmospheric waves—generating
            untold ripple effects around the planet.</span>
         
         According to one modeling study, for example, if the <span class="place">Amazon</span> were ever completely deforested, the snowpack in the <span class="place">Sierra Nevada</span> mountains—a crucial water reservoir for <span class="place">California</span>—would be diminished by half.
         
         That’s without even considering the effect on CO2 and climate.
         
         Burning time
         <span class="solution">"The Amazon stores a tremendous amount of carbon,"</span> Nobre says.
         
         <span class="problem">Instead of sucking CO2 from the sky, a deforested Amazon could instead begin releasing
            stored greenhouse gases.</span> If 60 percent of the forest were to degrade to a savanna, Nobre says, that could
         unleash the equivalent of five or six years’ worth of global fossil-fuel emissions.
         
         Michael Mann, a climate scientist and director of the <span class="place">Earth System Science Center</span> at <span class="place">Pennsylvania State University,</span> called it "another aggravating climate feedback" loop, where drying rainforest leads
         to less absorption of CO2, which in turn promotes more climate change, drying more
         forest.
         
         "We depend quite a bit on the continued functioning of key carbon sinks," he says.
         "That’s just one of the many things that makes climate change a global problem."
         
         In fact, deforestation, fire, and climate change already work synergistically in the
         <span class="place">Amazon.</span> In recent years, climate change has sparked droughts that let wildfires burn bigger
         and longer. <span class="solution">Between 2003 and 2013, forest clearing dropped by 76 percent,</span> <span class="problem">but the increase in wildfire, especially during the drought of 2015, erased half the
            increased absorption of CO2.</span>
         
         That's why Lovejoy and Nobre conclude that—contrary to Bolsonaro's campaign promise—what
         the <span class="place">Amazon</span> needs is not deforestation, but a massive campaign of tree planting.
         
         "It really makes sense to do some active reforestation to build that margin of safety,"
         Lovejoy says. "It doesn't have to be the forest primeval, but you need something with
         trees and relatively complex communities."
         
         At the very least, says Esquivel-Muelbert, <span class="place">Brazil</span> should avoid clearing more. Asked what message she would send to Brazil's president,
         she said: "Please, don't make things worse."
