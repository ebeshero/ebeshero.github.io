      <h4>July 2, 2019</h4>
      <p><span class="problem">The rate of losses has accelerated as Brazil's new right-wing president favours development over conservation.</span></p>
      <p><span class="place">The largest rainforest in the world, the Amazon</span> is a vital carbon store that slows down the pace of global warming.
      </p>
      <p><span class="problem">A senior Brazilian official, speaking anonymously, told us <span class="cause">his government was encouraging deforestation.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="problem"><span class="cause">Usually by bulldozers, either pushing against the trunks to force the shallow roots
               out of the ground, or by a pair of the machines advancing with a chain between them.</span></span></p>
      <p><span class="problem">In one vast stretch of recently cleared land, we found giant trees lying on their
            sides, much of the foliage still green and patches of bare earth drying under a fierce
            sun.</span></p>
      <p><span class="problem">Later, the timber will be cleared and sold or burned, and the land prepared for farming.</span></p>
      <p><span class="problem">In other areas, illegal loggers carve new tracks through the undergrowth to reach particularly valuable hardwood trees which they sell on the black market, often to order.</span></p>
      <p><span class="problem">Satellite images show a sharp increase in clearances of trees over the first half
            of this year, since Jair Bolsonaro became president of Brazil, the country that owns most of the Amazon region.</span></p>
      <p><span class="problem">The most recent analysis suggests a staggering scale of losses over the past two months
            in particular, with about a <span class="extent">hectare being cleared every minute</span> on average. The single biggest reason to fell trees, according to official figures,
            is to create new pastures for cattle, and during our visit we saw countless herds grazing on land that used to be rainforest.</span></p>
      <p> Over the past decade, previous governments had managed to reduce the clearances with
         concerted action by federal agencies and a system of fines.
      </p>
      <p>But this approach is being overturned by Mr Bolsonaro and his ministers who have criticised
         the penalties and overseen a dramatic fall in confiscations of timber and convictions
         for environmental crimes.
      </p>
      <p>The forest holds a vast amount of carbon in its billions of trees, accumulated over
         hundreds or even thousands of years.
      </p>
      <p>Every year, the leaves also absorb a huge quantity of carbon dioxide that would otherwise
         be left in the atmosphere adding to the rise in global temperatures.
      </p>
      <p>By one recent estimate, the trees of the Amazon rainforest pulled in carbon dioxide
         equivalent to the fossil fuel emissions of most of the nine countries that own or
         border the forest between 1980-2010.
      </p>
      <p>The forest is also the richest home to biodiversity on the planet, a habitat for perhaps
         one-tenth of all species of plants and animals.
      </p>
      <p>And it is where one million indigenous people live, hunting and gathering amid the
         trees.
      </p>
      <p>According to a senior Brazilian environment official, the impact is so "huge" that
         he took the risk of giving us an unauthorised interview to bring it to the attention
         of the world.
      </p>
      <p>We had to meet in secret and disguise his face and voice because Mr Bolsonaro has
         banned his environment staff from talking to the media.
      </p>
      <p>
         Over the course of three hours, a startling inside picture emerged of small, under-resourced
         teams of government experts passionate about saving the forest but seriously undermined
         by their own political masters.
      </p>
      <p>Mr Bolsonaro swept to power on a populist agenda backed by agricultural businesses
         and small farmers, many of whom believe that too much of the Amazon region is protected
         and that environment staff have too much influence.
      </p>
      <p> He has said he wants to weaken the laws protecting the forest and has attacked the
         civil servants whose job it is to guard the trees.
      </p>
      <p>The result, according to the environment official, is that "it feels like we are the
         enemies of the Amazon, when in fact we should be seen in a completely different way,
         as the people trying to protect our ecological heritage for future generations".
      </p>
      <p>"They don't want us to speak because we'll say the truth, that conservation areas
         are being invaded and destroyed, there are many people marking out areas that should
         be protected."
      </p>
      <p>The official believes the figures for deforestation could be even worse than officially
         recognised.
      </p>
      <p>"There's a government attempt to show the data is wrong, to show the numbers don't
         portray the reality," he told me.
      </p>
      <p>Ministers are considering hiring an independent contractor to handle information from
         satellite images of the region, questioning the work of the current government agency.
      </p>
      <p>Also, the rainy season is only now coming to an end, and because deforestation typically
         takes place in the drier months of the year, the official fears that the pace of losses
         could pick up speed.
      </p>
      <p>"In truth, it can be even worse," he said, because many of the areas recently damaged
         haven't yet been picked up by satellite images.
      </p>
      <p>"People need to know what's happening because we need allies to fight against invasions,
         to protect areas, and against deforestation." 
      </p>
      <p>We made repeated requests for interviews with the ministers for environment and agriculture
         but were refused.
      </p>
      <p>Earlier this year, Mr Bolsonaro, who's known as the "Trump of the Tropics", invited
         the US president to be a partner in exploiting the resources of the Amazon.
      </p>
      <p>Last month, in an interview with BBC Brasil, the environment minister Ricardo Salles,
         said landowners should be rewarded for preserving forest and that developed nations
         should foot the bill.
      </p>
      <p>And there's an assertive response when voices in the outside world call for the forest
         to be saved.
      </p>
      <p>The president's top security adviser, General Augusto Heleno Pereira, told Bloomberg
         last month that it was "nonsense" that the Amazon was part of the world's heritage.
      </p>
      <p>"The Amazon is Brazilian, the heritage of Brazil and should be dealt with by Brazil
         for the benefit of Brazil," he said.
      </p>
      <p>For decades, farming organisations have argued that the network of protected areas
         of forest, including reserves for indigenous people, is too restrictive for a developing
         country that needs to create jobs.
      </p>
      <p>A leading figure in the farmers' union in the city of Santarem, a hub for soya and
         cattle, told me that other countries had cleared their trees for agriculture but now
         wanted Brazil not to do the same.
      </p>
      <p>Vanderley Wegner said that the US and Europe, which buy produce from the Amazon region,
         have far less stringent controls on their forests, and that Europe "has very little
         forest left" anyway.
      </p>
      <p>"We have to develop the Amazon. More than four million people live here and they need
         development too, it's a constitutional right of every Brazilian citizen," he said.
