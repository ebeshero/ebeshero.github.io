         <span class="sectionHead"> Question 1<br></br></span>
         AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: Ecologist Dan Nepstad has studied the Amazon for more than 30
         years . 
         <span class="problem"> He explained to me why it's hard to know the true extent of these fires.
            
            DAN NEPSTAD: In an intact <span class="place"> Amazon forest</span> - a virgin forest - if it's a really dry year and the fire gets going, it's
            shin-high. You can step over it, and that means it doesn't register a lot of heat,
            and the satellites don't pick 
            up that as an act of fire. The best way to know if a forest is burning is to see smoke
            coming out the top.
            So it's really hard to know how much of the virgin forests of the Amazon are catching
            fire. If they're open fires 
            or fires burning damaged forests, they're much easier to spot, and that's most of
            what we're seeing this year. </span>
         
      </p>
      <p>
         <span class="sectionHead"> Qestion 2  <br></br></span>
         CORNISH: Talk more about what we are seeing this year. How is it different from fires
         in the past? 
         <span class="problem"> NEPSTAD:  Well,it's a big fire year. It's the biggest one in the last decade. A lot
            of the fires burning now are persistent, 
            and that means that those are  felled forests - <span class="cause">the giant rainforest trees that have been cut down with chainsaws, allowed to dry,
               and now they're 
               being burned in preparation for crops or pasture or whatever.</span> </span>  A lot of smoke because there's so much tree biomass, a lot of energy, 
         <span class="problem"> meaning that smoke goes really high into the atmosphere - and it can spread across
            entire regions. </span>
         
      </p>
      <p>  <span class="sectionHead"> Question 3 <br></br></span>
         CORNISH: You've written that the <span class="problem"> biggest threat to the Amazon is the large-scale displacement of scrub vegetation.
            What is that, and what does that mean
            in terms of the Amazon being exposed to more and more fires? </span>
         
         NEPSTAD:  <span class="problem">So what was deep, dense shade that kept the litter layer - <span class="cause">  the fuel layer - moist and difficult to burn is drying out, and there's a lot more
               of it. </span> The next fire is much more intense.
            It kills more trees, and pretty soon, grasses and shrubs start to move into what was
            a pristine forest, and that's what I call this scrub vegetation.   So that - eventually,
            you really can't recognize that that's a forest that
            was - never saw a chainsaw, but it's completely altered. That, for me, is the most
            worrisome long-term scenario for the Amazon.</span>
         
      </p>
      <p><span class="sectionHead"> Question 4<br></br></span>
         CORNISH: What, then, is the solution? What steps can the <span class="place">  Brazllian </span>  government take to protect the Amazon?
         
         NEPSTAD: You know, <span class="solution"> I think there's a huge opportunity to solve this,  and not just with dumping water
            or putting out fires.
            But to really come up with a systemic strategy that is long-term, we really need to
            shift from fire-prone systems, 
            like extensive cattle, to more intensive forms that are tree-based so that the landholder
            will be more reluctant to use fire
            to manage their land and they'll invest more in fire prevention.</span>
         
      </p>
      <p>
         <span class="sectionHead"> Question 5<br></br></span>
         CORNISH: Before I let you go, I've heard over and over the last few days this idea
         that the <span class="place">Amazon is the lungs of the world</span>.  Is that a good way to think of it?
         
         NEPSTAD: That's a little misleading. There's a lot of big, old trees, and they respire
         a lot. Just like people have to breathe in oxygen, those tree trunks also have to
         breathe in oxygen,
         and all of that dead wood, as it rots, is taking up oxygen- much better to focus on
         the Amazon as a cooling system for the planet. You know, really, every time a little
         droplet of water leaves a 
         leaf and goes into vapor, it's absorbing energy and it's cooling things down. And
         the Amazon is so big that if we lose it, it's going to change the way air and energy
         move around the planet, \
         and that means our climate will change. For me, that's something that really ties
         us to the health of the Amazon wherever we are on the planet.
         
         CORNISH: That's Dan Nepstad. He's president and founder of the  Earth Innovation Institute. Thank you for explaining this to us.
