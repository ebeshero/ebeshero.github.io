         <span class="sectionHead"> Record Carbon Dioxide Emissions in 2018<br></br></span>
         
         Last year’s Global Carbon Project forecast for 2017 (a forecast because the year was
         not over when the data were first published)
         made a splash: <span class="problem">They expected  fossil carbon dioxide emissions to grow in 2017, after flattening from 2014 to 2016.
            Prior to this, the climate community had been patting themselves on the back as emissions
            had been stabilizing. In a rough wake-up call,
            the  Global Carbon Project found this was no longer the case. This year’s numbers confirm their earlier projection:
            <span class="cause"> Total carbon dioxide
               </span></span>
         gigatonnes CO2 in 2018. Carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel sources will have
         grown by 2.7 percent this year, growing 
         even more quickly than the previous year, which saw a 1.6 percent increase.

      <p> 
         <span class="sectionHead"> World’s Major Emitters Not Doing Enough <br></br></span>
         <span class="problem">The world is looking to developed countries to lead the way to a low carbon future.
            But they are not curbing their reduction in fossil
            fuel consumption quickly enough.</span>
         In the case of the <span class="place">United States,</span> emissions are headed in the wrong direction altogether. <span class="problem"> Energy use in the <span class="place">U.S.</span> has increased over the last five years, reversing a
            decade of decline. Emissions are expected to increase in the US in 2018—a 2.5 percent
            increase between 2017 and 2018—in part due to weather (greater heating and 
            cooling demands) and increases in oil use due to low oil prices. Emissions declines
            in the E.U.  have slowed recently. Between 2017 and 2018, the EU saw a decline of
            emissions of only 0.7 percent.</span>
         At the same time,<span class="problem"> emissions growth is not slowing in other parts of the world, and in many cases is
            accelerating. Between 2017 and 2018, CO2 emissions climbed by 6.3
            percent in India (a rate three times higher than last year’s) and by 4.7 percent in
            <span class="place">China </span>(compared with last year’s rate of increase of 3.5 percent). The rest of the 
            world’s emissions have also been growing on average, with <span class="cause">CO2 emissions</span> 1.8 percent higher in 2018 than 2017.</span>
         There are bright spots. Almost 20 countries, contributing 20 percent of global CO2
         emissions, have decoupled fossil CO2 emissions and economic growth over the past decade.

      <p> 
         <span class="sectionHead"> Natural Gas and Oil Use Still Rising<br></br></span>
         <span class="problem"> <span class="cause">Natural gas</span> use is seeing the greatest acceleration, growing 2 percent annually in the last five
            years. While it has a lower carbon footprint
            than other <span class="cause">fossil fuels</span>, such as coal, it is a major source of the increase in carbon dioxide emissions.
            This is because natural gas is not only being used 
            to replace coal, but also meet new energy consumption needs. In <span class="place">China</span>, natural gas rose 8.4 percent per year since 2013 to <span class="cause"> respond to new energy needs,</span>  such as 
            for heavy manufacturing, in addition to replacing  coal.</span>
         Oil is also on the rise, with oil consumption up 1.4 percent per year since 2012.
         Most of the increase has been in <span class="place"> China </span>and <span class="place"> India</span>, with increases of roughly
         4 to 5 percent per year. While it had been previously thought that oil had reached
         its peak in the U.S. and E.U., oil use increased by 1.3 and 0.4 percent per 
         year in these regions, respectively. Greater reliance on vehicles—with the number
         of vehicles growing 4 percent per year globally since 2012—and longer trips per
         vehicle <span class="problem"> can help explain recent trends. Furthermore,<span class="cause">  air traffic is on the rise, offsetting any increases in fuel efficiency.</span></span>
         
      </p>
      <p> 
         One piece of good news:  Coal consumption has been declining steadily since 2013.
          Global energy consumption  from coal is declining on average almost 1 percent per year. In Canada and the U.S.,
         coal consumption dropped 40 percent since 2005. Coal may be phased out entirely in
         the United Kingdom by 2025, and in the E.U. 
         renewables may supply more primary energy than coal by 2021. However, the declines
         in coal in these countries could eventually be eclipsed by increased
         use of coal in other countries who currently lack energy access and are undertaking
         efforts to provide reliable energy accordingly. Coal consumption has been
         increasing in the Asia Pacific and Central/South America regions by 3 percent per
         year over the last decade. <span class="problem"> In India alone, the consumption of coal has risen 
            almost <span class="cause">  5 percent per year in recent years and now is greater than that of the E.U. and
               U.S. combined.</span> <span class="cause"> Yet significant numbers of people in <span class="place">India</span>—hundreds of millions—s
               till lack access to reliable sources of electricity.</span></span>
         
      </p>
      <p>
         <span class="sectionHead">Emissions Likely to Increase in 2019<br></br></span>
         The picture is uncertain in 2019, but a key publication associated with the Global Carbon Project <span class="problem"> expects even further increases 
            in 2019 given the persistent growth in oil  and natural
            gas and projected economic growth next year.</span>  <span class="problem">This is deeply troubling considering that the latest climate science suggests emissions
            should peak by 2020 
            to have a good chance of avoiding some of the worst climate impacts.</span> 
         <span class="solution"> When the Global Carbon Project’s initial figures came out last year suggesting that
            2017 ended a period of emissions flattening, it was difficult to tell whether it was
            a temporary uptic
            k or indicative of a longer trend. It’s of course still challenging to tell with just
            a few years of data, but it is now clear that 2017 wasn’t just an outlier.</span>
         <span class="problem"> We have no signs tha  emissions are stabilizing, let alone swiftly declining, which
            is necessary if we are to meet the <span class="place">Paris</span> Agreement’s temperature goals.</span>
         further ambition is needed. <span class="solution"> Parties have an opportunity to put forward more ambitious national commitments by
            2020, and they should do so as soon as possible.
            Greater ambition is also needed on financing to provide adequate support to developing
            countries to make a transition to a low carbon economy.</span> It will be critical 
         for Parties to consider if they can commit to peak emissions more quickly, peak at
         lower emissions levels and decline emissions much more rapidly for those countries
         
         that have already peaked emissions.
