         <span class="problem">Across the burning Amazon, Smoke is rising and fine
            particles of charcoal are falling softly to the ground. At last count, more than
            <span class="extent">93,000 fires </span>were
            alight in the <span class="place">Brazilian Amazon,</span> up more than 60
            percent from the same time last year, and the highest number since 2010. According
            to  NASA, this year’s fires are more intense than in
            previous years, too. But Brazil’s National Institute of
            Space Research (INPE) has nearly been keeping fire records since 1998, and
            two decades isn’t long in the life of <span class="cause"> a forest where trees
               live for centuries and humans have been setting fires for millennia.</span>
            Paleoecology—the study of ancient environments—offers unique insights into how the
            first Amazonian peoples manipulated fire in the landscape, the effects of those
            fires on the forest’s ecology over time, and lessons that might help to prevent
            modern fires.</span>
         <span class="problem">Layers of charcoal buried below the rainforest’s surface
            reveal that for thousands of years, <span class="cause"> the Amazon’s
               ancient inhabitants used fire to clear the forest floor for agriculture—and that
               it had a lasting effect, making those areas more fire prone today. But unlike
               many of the current fires, set to flatten the forest entirely, those indigenous
               fire practices left trees standing.</span>

         <span class="solution"> aleoecologists take samples from lakebeds and soils and
            examine those tiny fragments of charcoal that accumulate after a fire.This is
            rugged, hands-on science—teams backpack boats and coring equipment through the
            forest to remote lakes, then drill cores into the sediment layers at the bottom.
            Radiocarbon analysis allows them to date when the fires occurred. The first thing
            this kind of millennial perspective can show us is that there is virtually no
            natural fire in the <span class="place"> Amazon,</span> says Mark Bush, a professor of
            paleoecology at the  Florida Institute of Technology.
            </span>
         <span class="problem"> we have 4,000-year sequences with absolutely no hint of
            fire from the western Amazon—no charcoal, not a speck—and these are not in the
            wettest parts of the Amazon,” he says. Most rainforest trees, with their thin bark
            and superficial root systems, cannot tolerate fire—andn either can the animals that
            live there. “It’s a completely foreign, game-changing piece of ecology,” Bush says.
            “It affects everything from top to bottom in that system, and it will take many
            years for those plots to recover to anything that’s recognizable as rainforest.” The
            extent of human influence on the rainforest before Europeans arrived is debated, but
            everyone agrees that fire only appears when humans do, Bush says. <span class="cause"> The signature of fire is a uniquely human signature in the
               Amazon. It comes right in with maize or manioc agriculture—you know exactly
               what’s going on; it’s people in that landscape,” he says.</span>

         Yoshi Maezumi, a Marie Curie Fellow at the  University of Amsterdam 
         and a  National Geographic  Explorer, has been investigating that transition
         in different parts of the Amazon, from <span class="place"> Brazil</span> to <span class="place">
            Bolivia</span>. In one study, Maezumi’s team took sediment <span class="problem"> cores dating back 8,500 years from Lake Caranã in the Brazilian state of Pará,
            near where the Tapajós River meets the Amazon. Humans settled in the area around
            4,500 years ago, and began burning to clear space for agriculture, she says. But
            this wasn’t wholesale destruction. Instead, they planted a variety of crops among
            the trees, increased the prevalence of edible species like brazil nuts and acai, and
            began enriching the naturally poor soils using a combination of compost, waste, and
            charcoal, creating soils so rich they’re still sought after by farmers today. “We
            can’t say exactly how many people were there, but there were very extensive areas
            that were very heavily managed,” says Maezumi. <span class="cause">Fire was a key part of their
               land-use </span> strategy.</span> The charcoal records, together with pollen
         and other plant remains, showed that people were clearing the +understory with frequent,
         <span class="solution"> low-intensity burning,which Maezumi says would have
            limited the buildup of fuels and may have prevented larger wildfires. </span>
         That maintenance mattered, because in altering the composition of the forest, <span class="problem">the ancient Amazonians also made it more flammable and
            fire-prone—changes so profound that they can still be detected today.</span>
         Crystal McMichael from the University of Amsterdam was involved in a <span class="solution"> study that used remote sensing to measure the water content of
            the canopy in different parts of the Amazon. “We actually got results we didn’t
            quite expect,” McMichael says. They’d thought that the fertile forests where
            generations of pre-Columbian people had enriched the soil—creating what’s called
             terra preta, or Amazonian dark earths—would be more lush
            than surrounding areas. Instead, trees on those sites had less green canopy and
            lower water content, especially in drought years. They also had slightly smaller
            trees and less tree cover.</span> That makes sense, says Maezumi: “Imagine a
         dense rainforest, really dark and wet, with no sunlight penetrating to the lower canopy.
         But when you go out and start clearing, once you get sunlight you get drying and warmer
         temperatures.

         <span class="solution">The knowledge has implications for modern fire
            management—and the insights of paleoecology could potentially beused to inform how,
            when, and where burning is allowed in the Amazon.</span> Though Brazil’s
         president Jair Bolsonaro has been blamed for encouraging this year’s burning, in general
         government policies have suppressed the use of fire. In the drier, human-altered
         forests, that could actually have exacerbated the problem, Maezumi says. <span class="problem">When disease epidemics after European colonization wiped out as
            much as 95 percent of the Amazon’s indigenous inhabitants, the frequent,
            low-intensity burning stopped—and as the undergrowth returned, fuel loads increased.
            These flammable forests—making up perhaps three percent of the Amazon—could
            therefore act as catalysts forwildfires, Maezumi suggests, enabling them to spread
            into neighboring old-growth stands. <span class="cause"> “In the warmer, drier, more
               drought-prone world that we are facing—a world in which humans light
               fires</span>—what could we do? We could identify the areas that are the most
            vulnerable, like these forests that were managed by pre-Columbian peoples, and
            target them as <span class="place"> high-risk zones</span>.” What’s important, says McMichael,
            is that the ancient burning isn’t used to justify modern fires.</span>
         <span class="problem"> Humans might have burned some parts of the Amazon for
            thousands of years, but the fire records analyzed so far indicate that the scale of
            forest disturbance in the 21st century is probably unprecedented.</span>
         Maezumi’s sediment cores from <span class="place">ake Caranã</span>L show the last few decades have
         laid down charcoal in the <span class="place">lake-bed </span> at a rate four times higher than
         during the peak of the pre-Colombian period. That would mean there’s nothing in the
         charcoal archives that can tell us what happens next, says McMichael. “The fires that
         we
         see in the paleo record are temporally less frequent, seem to be spatially less
         extensive across the landscape, and didn’t occur everywhere. So really, we don’t know
         what happens if you introduce fire into a lot of those other areas,” she says.
