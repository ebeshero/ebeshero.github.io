         This increase primarily due to the expected coverage
         of the <span class="place">China</span> national ETS. While this trend brings
         the global coverage of GHG emissions closer to
         the Carbon Pricing Leadership Coalition’s (CPLC’s)
         target of 25 percent by 2020, further progress will
         be needed to reach this goal.9
         Carbon prices vary substantially, from less than
         US$1/tCO2
         e to a maximum of US$139/tCO2
         e, as
         shown in Figure 6 and Figure 7. Most initiatives saw an
         increase in their 2018 price levels compared to those
         in 2017. One substantial change was the growth in the
         European Union Allowance (EUA) price from €5/tCO2
         e
         to €13/tCO2
         e (US$7/tCO2
         e to US$16/tCO2
         e) as more
         certainty developed on the future of the <span class="place">European
            Union (EU)</span> ETS in the post-2020 period. In addition,
         <span class="problem">planned tax rate increases</span> occurred, including
         the escalation of the <span class="place">France</span> carbon tax rate from
         €30.5/tCO2e to €44.6/tCO2e (US$38/tCO2e to
         US$55/tCO2e) and the <span class="place">Switzerland</span> carbon tax rate
         from CHF84/tCO2e to CHF96/tCO2e (US$88/tCO2e
         to US$101/tCO2
         e). Despite these developments over
         the past year, most jurisdictions have carbon prices
         that are substantially lower than those needed to be
         consistent with the Paris Agreement, as displayed in
         Figure 7.

         <span class="sectionHead">Goverment policy on carbon pricing<br></br></span>
         <span class="solution">Governments raised approximately US$33 billion
            in carbon pricing revenues in 2017,</span> the source of
         which was allowance auctions, direct payments
         to meet compliance obligations and carbon tax
         receipts. <span class="solution">This represents an increase of nearly
            US$11 billion compared to the US$22 billion raised
            in 2016.</span> Reasons for this increase include auction
         revenues from the newly launched <span class="place">Ontario</span> ETS and
         revenues from the new carbon taxes in <span class="place">Alberta, Chile</span>
         and <span class="place">Colombia.</span> Existing initiatives also contributed to
         this trend, including a larger number of allowances
         bought at auctions in the <span class="place">California</span> ETS combined
         with higher auction sale prices,10 and an increase in
         the EUA price and the carbon tax rate in <span class="place">France</span>. The
         EU ETS remains the largest source of carbon pricing
         revenues due to its size, followed by the carbon
         taxes in , <span class="place">Sweden</span> and <span class="place">Japan,</span> as illustrated in
         Figure 8
         .
