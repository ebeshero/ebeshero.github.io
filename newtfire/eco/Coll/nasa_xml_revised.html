         The primary mission of ECOSTRESS is to measure the temperature of
         plants from the vantage point of the <span class="place">International Space
            Station.</span> However, it can also detect other heat-related
         phenomena like heat waves, volcanoes and fires. Due to the <span class="place">space
            station's</span> unique orbit, ECOSTRESS
         acquires <span class="solution">imagery of the same areas at different times of day as it
            passes by overhead - instead of crossing over each area at
            the same time of day like satellites in some other orbits do.</span> This is
         particularly important when trying to acquire cloud-free imagery over
         perennially cloudy areas like the <span class="place">Amazon.</span>

         ECOSTRESS launched to the <span class="place">space station</span> on June 29,
         2018.
         NASA's
         <span class="place">Jet Propulsion Laboratory</span> in <span class="place">Pasadena, California</span>,
         built and manages the ECOSTRESS mission for the
         Earth Science Division in the Science Mission Directorate at
         <span class="place">NASA Headquarters</span> in <span class="place">Washington</span>.
         ECOSTRESS is an Earth Venture Instrument mission; the program is managed
         by NASA's Earth System Science Pathfinder program at <span class="place">NASA's Langley
            Research Center</span> in <span class="place">Hampton, Virginia.</span>
