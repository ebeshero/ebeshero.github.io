      <h1>Climate 101: Deforestation</h1>

      <p>As the world seeks to slow the pace of <span class="problem">climate change</span>, <span class="problem">preserve wildlife</span>, and <span class="problem">support billions of people</span>, trees 
         inevitably hold a major part of the answer. <span class="problem">Yet the mass destruction of trees—deforestation—continues, sacrificing the long-term
            benefits of standing trees for short-term gain.</span>
         Forests still cover about 30 percent of the world’s land area, but they are disappearing
         at an alarming rate. <span class="problem"><span class="extent">Between 1990 and 2016</span>, <span class="extent">the world lost 502,000 square miles (1.3 million square kilometers) of forest, according
               to the World Bank—an area larger than South Africa</span>.</span> <span class="problem"><span class="extent">Since humans started cutting down forests, 46 percent of trees have been felled</span>, according to a 2015 study
            in the journal Nature.</span> <span class="problem">About <span class="extent">17 percent of the Amazonian rainforest has been destroyed</span> <span class="extent">over the past 50 years</span>, and 
            losses recently have been on the rise</span>. We need trees for a variety of reasons, not least of which is that they absorb 
         not only the carbon dioxide that we exhale, but also the heat-trapping greenhouse
         gases that human activities emit.
         As those gases enter the atmosphere, global warming increases, a trend scientists
         now prefer to call climate change. 
         Tropical tree cover alone can provide 23 percent of the climate mitigation needed
         over the next decade to meet goals set in the Paris 
         Agreement in 2015, according to one estimate.

         <span class="sectionHead">Causes of deforestation<br></br></span>
         <span class="problem"><span class="cause">Farming</span>, <span class="cause">grazing of livestock</span>, <span class="cause">mining</span>, and <span class="cause">drilling</span> combined account for more than half of all deforestation. <span class="cause">Forestry practices</span>, <span class="cause">wildfires</span> and, in small part, <span class="cause">urbanization</span> account for the rest.</span> <span class="problem">In <span class="place">Malaysia</span> and <span class="place">Indonesia</span>, forests are cut down to make way for producing palm oil, which can be found in everything from shampoo to saltines.</span>
         <span class="problem">In the <span class="place">Amazon</span>, <span class="cause">cattle ranching</span> and <span class="cause">farms—particularly soy plantations</span>—are key culprits.
            <span class="cause">Logging</span> operations, which provide the world’s wood and paper products, also fell countless trees each year.
            <span class="cause">Loggers, some of them acting illegally, also build roads to access more and more remote
               forests—which leads to</span>
            further deforestation.</span> <span class="problem">Forests are also cut as a result of growing <span class="cause">urban sprawl</span> as land is developed for homes.</span>
         <span class="problem">Not all deforestation is intentional. Some is caused by a combination of human and
            natural factors like <span class="cause">wildfires</span>
            and <span class="cause">overgrazing</span>, which may prevent the growth of young trees.</span></p>
      <p>
         <span class="sectionHead">Why it matters and what can be done<br></br></span>
         Deforestation affects the people and animals where trees are cut, as well as the wider
         world. <span class="problem">Some <span class="extent">250 million 
               people</span> living in forest and savannah areas depend on them for subsistence and income—many
            of them among the
            world’s rural poor.</span> <span class="problem">Eighty percent of Earth’s land animals and plants live in forests, and deforestation
            threatens 
            species including the orangutan, Sumatran tiger, and many species of birds. Removing trees deprives the forest
            of portions of its canopy, which blocks the sun’s rays during the day and retains
            heat at night. That disruption 
            leads to more extreme temperature swings that can be harmful to plants and animals</span>.
      </p>
      <p>Yet the effects of deforestation reach much farther. <span class="problem">The <span class="place">South American rainforest</span>, for example, influences 
            regional and perhaps even global water cycles, and it's key to the water supply in <span class="place">Brazilian cities</span> and
            neighboring countries.</span> <span class="problem"><span class="place">The Amazon</span> actually helps furnish water to some of the soy farmers and beef ranchers 
            who are clearing the forest. The loss of clean water and biodiversity from all forests
            could have many other
            effects we can’t foresee, touching even your morning cup of coffee.</span></p>
      <p><span class="problem">In terms of climate change, cutting trees both adds carbon dioxide to the air and
            removes the ability to absorb
            existing carbon dioxide. <span class="cause">If tropical deforestation were a country, according to the World Resources Institute,
               
               it would rank third in carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions, behind China and the U.S.</span></span>
         The numbers are grim, but many conservationists see reasons for hope. A movement is
         under way to preserve existing
         forest ecosystems and restore lost tree cover. <span class="solution">Organizations and activists are working to fight illegal mining and logging—National
            
            Geographic Explorer Topher White, for example, has come up with a way to use recycled cell phones to monitor for 
            chainsaws.</span> <span class="solution">In <span class="place">Tanzania</span>, the residents of Kokota have planted <span class="extent">more than 2 million trees</span> on their small island over a
            decade, aiming to repair previous damage.</span> <span class="solution">And in Brazil, conservationists are rallying in the face of ominous
            signals that the government may roll back forest protections.</span>
         <span class="solution">For consumers, it makes sense to examine the products and meats you buy, looking for
            sustainably produced sources 
            when you can. Nonprofit groups such as the Forest Stewardship Council and the Rainforest Alliance certify products they consider sustainable, while the World Wildlife Fund has a palm oil scorecard for consumer brands.</span></p>
