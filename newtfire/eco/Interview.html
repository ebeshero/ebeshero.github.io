      <h2> Greta Thunbberg Interview </h2>  
        <h4> Greta Thunberg led a protest at the White House on Friday. 
            But she wasn't looking to go inside â€” "I don't want to meet with people who don't 
            accept the science," she says. The young Swedish activist joined a large crowd of 
            protesters who had gathered outside, calling for immediate action to help the environment
            and reverse an alarming warming trend in average global temperatures. She 
            says her message for President Trump is the same thing she tells other politicians: 
            Listen to science, and take responsibility. Thunberg, 16, arrived in the U.S. 
            last week after sailing across the Atlantic to avoid the carbon emissions from jet travel.</h4>
