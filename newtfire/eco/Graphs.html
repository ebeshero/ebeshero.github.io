                Europe is more protective of their forests
                as of late.  France is a leader in reforesting of the land. 
                France is the fourth most forested country in Europe only behind Sweden,
                Spain, and Finland, all of these countries have strong laws that protect 
                forested areas.  Well this step helps in protecting habitats of birds,
                insects and woodland critters these man planted trees and forests
                are not as effective as a natural forest for protecting biodiversity. 
                This chart will show just how much forest other countries have lost 
                with Russia leading the way.  According to the Wildlife foundation 18.7
                million acres of forest are lost each year, that's over 27 soccer fields
                every minute.  </p>
