                     and most whimsical letters over multiple decades. According to L'Estrange, Elford
                     was a friend of Mitford's father, and
                     Mitford met him for the first time in the
                     spring of 1810 when he was nearing the age of 64. "He was a fellow of the Royal

                     borough he also represented in Parliament for many years. Mr.

            <p>Hands other than Mitford's noted on this manuscript: </p>
            <ul>
               <li> Red crayon or thick red pencil. Probably a different hand from Mitford's that marks
                  many of her letters, sometimes drawing diagonal lines across pages, and sometimes
                  writing words overtop and perpendicularly across Mitford's writing. On this letter,
                  a red line is drawn from the top center diagonally slightly left to the bottom of
                  the first page, and then is drawn in the usual way from top left to bottom right of
                  each of the other leaves.
               </li>
               <li> Someone, apparently other than Mitford, perhaps cataloging letters and describing
                  them, who left grey pencil marks and numbered her letters now in the Reading Central
                  Library's collection. This letter is numbered "16" in the top left of the first leaf,
                  underneath the opening line, "To Sir W. Elford."

            </ul>Mitford’s spelling and punctuation are retained, except where a word is split at the
            end of a line and the beginning of the next in the manuscript. Where Mitford’s spelling
            and hyphenation of words deviates from the standard, in order to facilitate searching
            we are using the TEI elements “choice," “sic," and “reg" to encode both Mitford’s
            spelling and the regular international standard of Oxford English spelling, following
            the first listed spelling in the Oxford English Dictionary. The long s and ligatured
            forms are not encoded.

                           Poet, playwright, writer of prose fiction sketches, Mary Russell Mitford is, of course,
                           the subject of our archive. Much of her writing was devoted to supporting herself
                           and her parents. She received a civil list pension in 1837. Mitford's long life and
                           prolific career ended after injuries from a carriage accident, and she is buried in
                           Swallowfield churchyard.

                           votes.) A Whig politician, he began running for Parliament elections as the member

                           Massacre in 1819. Mitford's letters indicate a pronounced dislike of him as she vastly
                           preferred his opponent J. B. Monck, and she reportedly satirized the Palmer in 1818
                           as "vastly like a mop-stick, or, rather, a tall hop-pole, or an extremely long fishing-rod,
