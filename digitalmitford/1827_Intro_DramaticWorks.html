Dryden supported a revival of drama in Restoration England, and in 1668 he wrote Of Dramatick Poesie, which contained critiques of William Shakespeare's and Ben Jonson's plays and reflection on English and French theater and playwrights from the Renaissance to the Restoration in England. Several of his plays were staged in London in the 1670s, including his treatment of the Antony and Cleopatra narrative, in All for Love, or, The World Well Lost, performed in December 1677 and published in 1678. His satirical poem Absalom and Achitophel, published in 1681, presents Restoration politicians and government figures in Old Testament roles, casting King Charles II in flattering terms as a merciful and benevolent David.

Much of her writing was devoted to supporting herself and her parents. She received a civil list pension in 1837. Mitford's long life and prolific career ended after injuries from a carriage accident, and she is buried in

Dryden supported a revival of drama in Restoration England, and in 1668 he wrote Of Dramatick Poesie, which contained critiques of William Shakespeare's and Ben Jonson's plays and reflection on English and French theater and playwrights from the Renaissance to the Restoration in England. Several of his plays were staged in London in the 1670s, including his treatment of the Antony and Cleopatra narrative, in All for Love, or, The World Well Lost, performed in December 1677 and published in 1678. His satirical poem Absalom and Achitophel, published in 1681, presents Restoration politicians and government figures in Old Testament roles, casting King Charles II in flattering terms as a merciful and benevolent David.

                        Westminster. One of the "patent theaters." First theater on this site was
                        opened in 1732 by John Rich, renovated by architect Henry Holland in 1792,
                        and destroyed by fire on 20 Sept. 1808. The second theater, designed by
                        Robert Smirke, opened on 18 Sept. 1809, managed by John Phillip Kemble. Because of rent
                        increases by the Duke of Bedford, the landowner, J.P. Kemble increased
                        ticket prices. This led to the "old price (or O.P.) riots" and the eventual
                        lowering of ticket prices, although the proprietors proved they would lose
                        money at those prices. The second theater was destroyed by fire on 5 March
                        1856. The third theater, designed by Edward Middleton Barry, opened in 1858
                        and remains the nucleus of today's theater. The theater became the Royal
                        Opera House in 1892 and the building was renovated and expaneded in the
                        1980s and 1990s.--#lmw</span>

Double, too, were the cares not merely of the official before-mentioned, the call-boy, but of his superiors, the stage-manager and the prompter; for whilst we, the new tragedy, held after our strange scrambling fashion possession of the stage, the <span class="pagebreak">page 19<br/>

Died: 1846-06-22 in London. <br/>Benjamin Robert Haydon was a painter educated at the
                        Royal Academy, who was famous for contemporary,
                     historical, classical, biblical, and mythological scenes, though tormented by
                     financial difficulties. He painted William
                        Wordsworth's portrait in 1842. MRM was introduced to him at his London studio in the spring of
                     1817, and Sir William Elford was a
                     mutual friend.
                     He
                     committed suicide in 1846.
                      English painter and author (1786-1846) Published Autobiography in 3 vols.
