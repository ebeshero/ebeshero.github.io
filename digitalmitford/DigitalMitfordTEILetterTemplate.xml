            <p>Mitford’s spelling and punctuation are retained, except where a word is split at the
               end of a line and the beginning of the next in the manuscript. Where Mitford’s
               spelling and hyphenation of words deviates from the standard, in order to facilitate
               searching we are using the TEI elements “choice," “sic," and “reg" to encode both
               Mitford’s spelling and the regular international standard of Oxford English spelling,
               following the first listed spelling in the Oxford English Dictionary. The long s and
               ligatured forms are not encoded.</p>

            <p>The magnificent portion of bride cake arrived this morning &amp; shall be distributed
               as you desire. Yes, we will set half the pretty girls in the parish dreaming on it--I
               wanted to make a bargain with one to whom I gave a bit just now that she should tell
               me her dream--but she says that would destroy the charm--If she told who the husband
               was to be she should never <del rend="squiggles">
                  <gap quantity="1" unit="word"/>
               </del> get him. There was no saying a word after that you know. Bythebye nothing but
               the sort of sacred air that breathes around Bridecake--so that to steal that would be
               to invade the sweetest &amp; holiest of our affections &amp; sympathies--nothing but
               this fine &amp; general feeling could have preserved your munificent present, &amp;
               brought it safe to us. By some accident it was sent not by a <placeName
                  ref="#Reading_city">Reading</placeName> Coach but a <placeName ref="#Newbury"
                  >Newbury</placeName>one, &amp; found its way to <placeName ref="#ThreeMileCross"
                  >Three Mile Cross</placeName>, after being carried half way to <placeName
                  ref="#Newbury">Newbury</placeName>, through the intervention of all manner of men
               &amp; women--Post boys--&amp; Chambermaids &amp; keepers of Turnpike gates. But every
               thing belonging to such a <rs type="event" ref="#HaydonHymanWed">Wedding</rs> &amp;
               such a Honeymoon as yours will turn out right depend on it. You see that your good
               luck extends even to your friends--&amp; travels about with your bride-cake. Oh it
               will never forsake you! Never! I think that last honeymoon letter written whilst the
               fair Bride was sitting working &amp; smiling at your side, was prettier even than the
               first. Did you read it to her as you wrote it? or <pb n="2"/> shall I send her a
               copy? It was worthy even of that charming seal. How much you must both have felt in
               going into your painting room!-- Will <title ref="#Lazarus_Haydon">the
                  Lazarus</title> be finished against next season? If any thing could improve your
               genius it would be living in such a sunshine of love &amp; beauty.</p>

               pleasure of being known to <persName ref="#Haydon_Mrs">Mrs. Haydon</persName>--She
               mentioned your note with great delight, &amp; talked of calling--but was not I
               suppose certain of the time you would return to <placeName>

               </placeName>. She is by this time back again at <placeName ref="#Richmond"
                  >Richmond</placeName>. I wished her very much to call on you Sunday or Monday that
               she might leave with you my poor <title ref="#Foscari_MRMplay">Tragedy</title> which
               I have should of all things have wished you to read--indeed I begged her to take the
               chance--I have such an opinion of your judgment. But it is now out of her hands. Only
               think of my shocking ill luck in having written on the same subject with <persName
                  ref="#Byron">Lord Byron</persName>--The story of <persName ref="#Foscari_Fr"
                  >Foscari</persName>--I am so distressed at <rs type="person" ref="#Byron">the idea
                  of a competition, not merely with his Lordship's talents, but with his great name,
                  &amp; the strange awe in which he holds people, &amp; the terrible scoffs &amp;
                  sneers in which he indulges himself</rs>, that I have written to <persName

               </del> friend on the propriety of entirely suppressing my play, which had gone to
                  <placeName ref="#London_city">Town</placeName> to be presented to <persName
                  ref="#Macready_Wm">the Manager</persName> the very day that the subject of <rs
                  type="title" ref="#The_Two_Foscari">Lord Byron's</rs> was announced.<note
                  resp="#ebb">
                  <rs type="title" ref="#The_Two_Foscari">Lord Byron's play</rs> was published by
                  John Murray on <date when="1821-12-19">19 December 1821</date>. Byron had composed
                  it between <date from="1821-06-12" to="1821-07-09">12 June and 9 July 1821</date>
                  in <placeName ref="#Ravenna"
                  >Ravenna</placeName>.<!--ebb: Give more details: We need to determine the date that Byron's volume was announced, presumably in October.--></note>
               I rather think now that it will not be offered--that <persName ref="#Talfourd_Thos"
                  >Mr. Talfourd</persName> will suppress it--&amp; I heartily wish he may. My poor
                  <title ref="#Foscari_MRMplay">Tragedy</title> has been a work of great labour
               &amp; is certainly complete enough in its own small way, but it is abundantly
               womanish &amp; feeble, &amp; does not at all adhere to the literal historic
               truth--which would be a great disadvantage in case <rs type="person" ref="#Byron">the
                  noble author</rs>
               <pb n="3"/> should have done so, &amp; have made the public familiar with the facts.
               I hope it will not be offered. What do you think of <persName ref="#Byron">Lord
                  Byron's</persName> dramatic power? <title ref="#Manfred">Manfred</title> was very
               fine certainly--perhaps the finest thing he ever did--&amp; <title
                  ref="#Marino_Faliero">Marino Faliero</title> certainly the worst. But <persName
                  ref="#Foscari_Fr">Foscari</persName> is a story of real human sympathy--not of
               factitious sentiment--He will certainly succeed in that. If this play be sent back to
               me unoffered I shall immediately begin another on some German story&amp; shall take
               for the opening the exquisite first act of the <title ref="#Orestes">Orestes</title>
               of <persName ref="#Euripedes">Euripides</persName>--which I saw acted so finely a
               fortnight ago, &amp; which it is quite wonderful to think has never been transferred
               to the English stage. What astonishing people those Greek dramatists were! I am just
               now reading <persName ref="#Potter_R">Potter</persName>'s <title
                  ref="#Aeschylus_Potter">Aeschylus</title> with the intensity of admiration with
               which you <damage type="portion_of_seal"/> would look at the frescoes of <persName
                  ref="#Michelangelo">Michael Angelo</persName>
               <del type="crossout">&amp;</del> Happening to express something of this enthusiasm to
