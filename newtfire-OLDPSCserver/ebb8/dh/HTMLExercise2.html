        <h3>Analysis of the task</h3>
        <p>Now that you have created your initial web page (in <a href="HTMLExercise1.html">Exercise
                1</a>) this exercise will focus on bettering your personal web presence. For this
            assignment you will rewrite your HTML and CSS adding more context and elements that
            style your site. Expand and develop your first HTML webpage(s) by making edits to the
            page layouts and structure. Test out different color schemes. If you didn't do so in the
            previous exercise, experiment with linking to other internal pages as well as outside
            websites. You can add more images and test out the various ways to format images with
            your CSS.</p>
        <h4>Taking it further with server side includes (SSIs)</h4>
        <p>We work with <dfn>server side includes</dfn> (SSIs) to help keep repeating portions of
            our pages uniform on a large website with multiple pages. For example, we are using it
            to generate our newtFire logo on the page you are reading and the entire top portion of
            the page you are reading, including the horizontal rule <code>&lt;hr&gt;</code> element
            that draws the line above the title of this page. If you view the page-source, you can
            see where we positioned a server-side include, just after the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>
            element in our code. It looks like an HTML/XML comment tag, and it functions as a
            special kind of comment to the server hosting our newtFire site: </p>
        <div class="code"> &lt;!--#include virtual="top.html" --&gt; </div>
        <p>With the server-side include, we ask the server to include a small partial file named
                <code>top.html</code> at this point on the page. There are other forms a server-side
            include might take, but most often we use it for this purpose, and indeed the top.html
            file on the main newtFire site itself contains a server-side include that publishes the
            date on which the page was last modified. </p>
        <p>With this exercise, we would like you to learn how to write and incorporate one (or more)
            server-side includes on an HTML page. First, please read our <a href="SSI.html">tutorial
                on Server Side Includes</a>, and if you would like to see more examples of server
            side includes, see <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/howto/ssi.html"
                >https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/howto/ssi.html</a>. Then apply one or more
            server-side includes to your existing personal webpage.</p>
        <p><em>Note:</em> it is necessary to modify the x-bit (following our instructions on the <a
                href="SSI.html">SSI tutorial</a>) on all of the uploaded files that you want a SSI
            to be visible. To test whether an SSI is working you have to load your page from the web
            server. You will not be able to see an SSI by opening the file locally in a web
            browser.</p>
        <h4>Students considering the Digital Studies Certificate</h4>
        <p>With this homework assignment, we ask that you make a start on the requirements found on
            our <a href="dsPortfolio.html">Portfolio Standards</a> page to make a professional
            homepage for yourself. You might try to prepare a résumé on your site in HTML or list
            and link to relevant sites that help to represent you. Your portfolio site might contain
            a picture of you or use images and links to external pages to help convey your
            interests.</p>
        <h3>Submitting your work</h3>
        <p>Save your redeveloped HTML page(s) and CSS over the existing files from Exercise 1 in
            your <q>personal webpage</q> Git repository and your personal web space accounts at
            newtFire.org on the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center using your preferred file transfer
            program. It is important for you to get used to saving over your existing files as you
            make changes. So in this case <strong>your <code>index.html</code> file for this exercise will
            replace your Exercise 1 <code>index.html</code> file</strong> that way your newly developed main
            page of your site will not need an additional file name at the end of your website's
            address. Therefore, <code>www.newtfire.org/~yourPittID</code> should show your
            redeveloped home page.</p>
