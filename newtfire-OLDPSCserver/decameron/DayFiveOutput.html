            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>All the east was white, nor any part of our hemisphere
               unillumined
               by the rising beams, when the carolling of the birds that in
               gay chorus saluted the dawn among the boughs induced <span class="person">Fiammetta</span>
               to rise and rouse the other ladies and the three gallants; with whom
               adown the hill and about the dewy meads of the broad champaign
               she sauntered, talking gaily of divers matters, until the sun had
               attained some height. Then, feeling his rays grow somewhat
               scorching, they retraced their steps, and returned to the villa; where,
               having repaired their slight fatigue with excellent wines and comfits,
               they took their pastime in the pleasant garden until the breakfast
               hour; when, all things being made ready by the discreet seneschal,
               they, after singing a stampita,A song accompanied by music, but
               without dancing. and a balladette or two, gaily, at the
               queen's behest, sat them down to eat. Meetly ordered and gladsome
               was the meal, which done, heedful of their rule of dancing, they
               trod a few short measures with accompaniment of music and song.
               Thereupon, being all dismissed by the queen until after the siesta,
               some hied them to rest, while others tarried taking their pleasure in
               the fair garden. But shortly after none, all, at the queen's behest,
               reassembled, according to their wont, by the fountain; and the
               queen, having seated herself on her throne, glanced towards Pamfilo,
               and bade him with a smile lead off with the stories of good fortune.
               Whereto Pamfilo gladly addressed himself, and thus began.

            <p>Once upon a time, then, as we have read in the ancient histories
               of the Cypriotes, there was in the island of <span class="place">Cyprus</span> a very great
               noble named Aristippus, a man rich in all worldly goods beyond all
               other of his countrymen, and who might have deemed himself
               incomparably blessed, but for a single sore affliction that Fortune had
               allotted him. Which was that among his sons he had one, the best
               grown and handsomest of them all, that was well-nigh a hopeless
               imbecile. His true name was Galesus; but, as neither his tutor's
               pains, nor his father's coaxing or chastisement, nor any other method
               had availed to imbue him with any tincture of letters or manners, but
               he still remained gruff and savage of voice, and in his bearing
               liker to a beast than to a man, all, as in derision, were wont to call
               him Cimon, which in their language signifies the same as bestione
               (brute)One of the augmentative forms of bestia. in ours. 
               The father, grieved beyond measure to see his
               son's life thus blighted, and having abandoned all hope of his recovery,
               nor caring to have the cause of his mortification ever before his
               eyes, bade him betake him to the farm, and there keep with his
               husbandmen. To Cimon the change was very welcome, because
               the manners and habits of the uncouth hinds were more to his taste
               than those of the citizens. So to the farm Cimon hied him, and
               addressed himself to the work thereof; and being thus employed, he
               chanced one afternoon as he passed, staff on shoulder, from one
               domain to another, to enter a plantation, the like of which for beauty
               there was not in those parts, and which was then--for 'twas the
               month of May--a mass of greenery; and, as he traversed it, he
               came, as Fortune was pleased to guide him, to a meadow girt in with
               trees exceeding tall, and having in one of its corners a fountain most
               fair and cool, beside which he espied a most beautiful girl lying
               asleep on the green grass, clad only in a vest of such fine stuff that it
               scarce in any measure veiled the whiteness of her flesh, and below the
               waist nought but an apron most white and fine of texture; and
               likewise at her feet there slept two women and a man, her slaves.
               No sooner did Cimon catch sight of her, than, as if he had never
               before seen form of woman, he stopped short, and leaning on his
               cudgel, regarded her intently, saying never a word, and lost in admiration.
               And in his rude soul, which, despite a thousand lessons, had
               hitherto remained impervious to every delight that belongs to urbane
               life, he felt the awakening of an idea, that bade his gross and coarse
               mind acknowledge, that this girl was the fairest creature that had ever
               been seen by mortal eye. And thereupon he began to distinguish
               her several parts, praising her hair, which shewed to him as gold, her
               brow, her nose and mouth, her throat and arms, and above all her
               bosom, which was as yet but in bud, and as he gazed, he changed
               of a sudden from a husbandman into a judge of beauty, and desired
               of all things to see her eyes, which the weight of her deep slumber
               kept close shut, and many a time he would fain have awakened her,
               that he might see them. But so much fairer seemed she to
               him than any other woman that he had seen, that he doubted
               she must be a goddess; and as he was not so devoid of sense but
               that he deemed things divine more worthy of reverence than things
               mundane, he forbore, and waited until she should awake of her
               own accord; and though he found the delay overlong, yet,
               enthralled by so unwonted a delight, he knew not how to be
               going. However, after he had tarried a long while, it so befell
               that Iphigenia--such was the girl's name--her slaves still sleeping,
               awoke, and raised her head, and opened her eyes, and seeing
               Cimon standing before her, leaning on his staff, was not a little
               surprised, and said: Cimon, what seekest thou in this wood at
               this hour? 
               For Cimon she knew well, as indeed did almost all the
               country-side, by reason alike of his uncouth appearance as of the rank
               and wealth of his father. To Iphigenia's question he answered never
               a word; but as soon as her eyes were open, nought could he do but
               intently regard them, for it seemed to him that a soft influence
               emanated from them, which filled his soul with a delight that he had
               never before known. Which the girl marking began to misdoubt
               that by so fixed a scrutiny his boorish temper might be prompted to
               some act that should cause her dishonour: wherefore she roused her
               women, and got up, saying: Keep thy distance, Cimon, in God's
               name. 
               Whereto Cimon made answer: I will come with thee.
               And, albeit the girl refused his escort, being still in fear of him, she
               could not get quit of him; but he attended her home; after which
               he hied him straight to his father's house, and announced that he was
               minded on no account to go back to the farm: which intelligence was
               far from welcome to his father and kinsmen; but nevertheless they
               suffered him to stay, and waited to see what might be the reason or
               his change of mind. So Cimon, whose heart, closed to all teaching,
               love's shaft, sped by the beauty of Iphigenia, had penetrated, did now
               graduate in wisdom with such celerity as to astonish his father and
               kinsmen, and all that knew him. He began by requesting his father
               to let him go clad in the like apparel, and with, in all respects, the
               like personal equipment as his brothers: which his father very gladly
               did. Mixing thus with the gallants, and becoming familiar with the
               manners proper to gentlemen, and especially to lovers, he very soon,
               to the exceeding great wonder of all, not only acquired the rudiments of
               letters, but waxed most eminent among the philosophic wits.
               After which (for no other cause than the love he bore to Iphigenia)
               he not only modulated his gruff and boorish voice to a degree of
               smoothness suitable to urbane life, but made himself accomplished in
               singing and music; in riding also and in all matters belonging to
               war, as well by sea as by land, he waxed most expert and hardy. And
               in sum (that I go not about to enumerate each of his virtues in
               detail) he had not completed the fourth year from the day of his
               first becoming enamoured before he was grown the most gallant, and
               courteous, ay, and the most perfect in particular accomplishments, of
               the young cavaliers that were in the island of <span class="place">Cyprus</span>. What then,
               gracious ladies, are we to say of Cimon? Verily nought else but
               that the high faculties, with which Heaven had endowed his noble
               soul, invidious Fortune had bound with the strongest of cords, and
               circumscribed within a very narrow region of his heart; all which
               cords Love, more potent than Fortune, burst and brake in pieces;
               and then with the might, wherewith he awakens dormant powers, he
               brought them forth of the cruel obfuscation, in which they lay, into
               clear light, plainly shewing thereby, whence he may draw, and
               whither he may guide, by his beams the souls that are subject to
               his sway.
            </p>
            <p>Now, albeit by his love for Iphigenia Cimon was betrayed, as
               young lovers very frequently are, into some peccadillos, yet Aristippus,
               reflecting that it had turned him from a booby into a man, not
               only bore patiently with him, but exhorted him with all his heart to
               continue steadfast in his love And Cimon, who still refused to be
               called Galesus, because 'twas as Cimon that Iphigenia had first
               addressed him, being desirous to accomplish his desire by honourable
               means, did many a time urge his suit upon her father, Cipseus, that
               he would give her him to wife: whereto Cipseus always made the
               same answer, to wit, that he had promised her to Pasimondas, a
               young Rhodian noble, and was not minded to break faith with him.
               However, the time appointed for Iphigenia's wedding being come,
               and the bridegroom having sent for her, Cimon said to himself:
               'Tis now for me to shew thee, O Iphigenia, how great is my love
               for thee: 'tis by thee that I am grown a man, nor doubt I, if I
               shall have thee, that I shall wax more glorious than a god, and verily
               thee will I have, or die. Having so said, he privily enlisted in his
               cause
               certain young nobles that were his friends, and secretly fitted
               out a ship with all equipment meet for combat, and put to sea on the
               look-out for the ship that was to bear Iphigenia to <span class="place">Rhodes</span> and her
               husband. And at length, when her father had done lavishing
               honours upon her husband's friends, Iphigenia embarked, and, the
               mariners shaping their course for <span class="place">Rhodes</span>, put to sea. Cimon was on
               the alert, and overhauled them the very next day, and standing on
               his ship's prow shouted amain to those that were aboard Iphigenia's
               ship: Bring to; strike sails, or look to be conquered and sunk in
               the sea. 
               Then, seeing that the enemy had gotten their arms above
               deck, and were making ready to make a fight of it, he followed up his
               words by casting a grapnel upon the poop of the Rhodians, who were
               making great way; and having thus made their poop fast to his prow,
               he sprang, fierce as a lion, reckless whether he were followed or no,
               on to the Rhodians' ship, making, as it were, no account of them,
               and animated by love, hurled himself, sword in hand, with prodigious
               force among the enemy, and cutting and thrusting right and left,
               slaughtered them like sheep; insomuch that the Rhodians, marking
               the fury of his onset, threw down their arms, and as with one voice
               did all acknowledge themselves his prisoners. To whom Cimon:
               Gallants, quoth he, 'twas neither lust of booty nor enmity to
               you that caused me to put out from <span class="place">Cyprus</span> to attack you here with
               force of arms on the high seas. Moved was I thereto by that which
               to gain is to me a matter great indeed, which peaceably to yield me
               is to you but a slight matter; for 'tis even Iphigenia, whom more
               than aught else I love; whom, as I might not have her of her father
               in peaceable and friendly sort, Love has constrained me to take from
               you in this high-handed fashion and by force of arms; to whom I
               mean to be even such as would have been your Pasimondas: wherefore
               give her to me, and go your way, and God's grace go with
               you.
            </p>
            <p>Yielding rather to force than prompted by generosity, the Rhodians
               surrendered Iphigenia, all tears, to Cimon; who, marking her tears,
               said to her: Grieve not, noble lady; thy Cimon am I, who, by my
               long love, have established a far better right to thee than Pasimondas
               by the faith that was plighted to him. 
               So saying, he sent her aboard
               his ship, whither he followed her, touching nought that belonged to
               the Rhodians, and suffering them to go their way. 
               To have gotten so
               dear a prize made him the happiest man in the world, but for a
               time 'twas all he could do to assuage her grief: then, after taking
               counsel with his comrades, he deemed it best not to return to <span class="place">Cyprus</span>
               for the present: and so, by common consent they shaped their course
               for <span class="place">Crete</span>, where most of them, and especially Cimon, had alliances
               of old or recent date, and friends not a few, whereby they deemed
               that there they might tarry with Iphigenia in security. But Fortune,
               that had accorded Cimon so gladsome a capture of the lady, suddenly
               proved fickle, and converted the boundless joy of the enamoured
               gallant into woeful and bitter lamentation. 'Twas not yet full four
               hours since Cimon had parted from the Rhodians, when with the
               approach of night, that night from which Cimon hoped such joyance
               as he had never known, came weather most turbulent and tempestuous,
               which wrapped the heavens in cloud, and swept the sea with scathing
               blasts; whereby 'twas not possible for any to see how the ship was
               to be worked or steered, or to steady himself so as to do any duty upon
               her deck. Whereat what grief was Cimon's, it boots not to ask.
               Indeed it seemed to him that the gods had granted his heart's desire
               only that it might be harder for him to die, which had else been to
               him but a light matter. Not less downcast were his comrades; but
               most of all Iphigenia, who, weeping bitterly and shuddering at every
               wave that struck the ship, did cruelly curse Cimon's love and censure
               his rashness, averring that this tempest was come upon them for no
               other cause than that the gods had decreed, that, as 'twas in despite
               of their will that he purposed to espouse her, he should be frustrate of
               his presumptuous intent, and having lived to see her expire, should
               then himself meet a woeful death.
            </p>
            <p>While thus and yet more bitterly they bewailed them, and the
               mariners were at their wits' end, as the gale grew hourly more violent,
               nor knew they, nor might conjecture, whither they went, they drew
               nigh the island of <span class="place">Rhodes</span>, albeit that <span class="place">Rhodes</span> it was they wist not,
               and set themselves, as best and most skilfully they might, to run the
               ship aground. In which enterprise Fortune favoured them, bringing
               them into a little bay, where, shortly before them, was arrived the
               Rhodian ship that Cimon had let go. Nor were they sooner ware
               that 'twas <span class="place">Rhodes</span> they had made, than day broke, and, the sky thus
               brightening a little, they saw that they were about a bow-shot from
               the ship that they had released on the preceding day. 
               Whereupon Cimon,
               vexed beyond measure, being apprehensive of that which in
               fact befell them, bade make every effort to win out of the bay, and
               let Fortune carry them whither she would, for nowhere might they be
               in worse plight than there. So might and main they strove to bring
               the ship out, but all in vain: the violence of the gale thwarted them
               to such purpose as not only to preclude their passage out of the bay but
               to drive them, willing nilling, ashore. Whither no sooner were they
               come, than they were recognized by the Rhodian mariners, who were
               already landed. Of whom one ran with all speed to a farm hard by,
               whither the Rhodian gallants were gone, and told them that Fortune
               had brought Cimon and Iphigenia aboard their ship into the same
               bay to which she had guided them. Whereat the gallants were overjoyed,
               and taking with them not a few of the farm-servants, hied
               them in hot haste to the shore, where, Cimon and his men being
               already landed with intent to take refuge in a neighbouring wood,
               they took them all (with Iphigenia) and brought them to the farm.
               Whence, pursuant to an order of the Senate of <span class="place">Rhodes</span>, to which, so
               soon as he received the news, Pasimondas made his complaint, Cimon
               and his men were all marched off to prison by Lysimachus, chief
               magistrate of the Rhodians for that year, who came down from the
               city for the purpose with an exceeding great company of men at
               arms. On such wise did our hapless and enamoured Cimon lose his
               so lately won Iphigenia before he had had of her more than a kiss
               or two. Iphigenia was entertained and comforted of the annoy,
               occasioned as well by her recent capture as by the fury of the sea, by
               not a few noble ladies of <span class="place">Rhodes</span>, with whom she tarried until the
               day appointed for her marriage. In recompense of the release of the
               Rhodian gallants on the preceding day the lives of Cimon and his
               men were spared, notwithstanding that Pasimondas pressed might
               and main for their execution; and instead they were condemned to
               perpetual imprisonment: wherein, as may be supposed, they abode in
               dolorous plight, and despaired of ever again knowing happiness.
            </p>
            <p>However, it so befell that, Pasimondas accelerating his nuptials to
               the best of his power, Fortune, as if repenting her that in her haste
               she had done Cimon so evil a turn, did now by a fresh disposition of
               events compass his deliverance. Pasimondas had a brother, by name
               Hormisdas, his equal in all respects save in years, who had long
               been contract to marry Cassandra, a fair and noble damsel of <span class="place">Rhodes</span>,
               of whom Lysimachus was in the last degree enamoured;
               but owing to divers accidents the marriage had been from time to
               time put off. Now Pasimondas, being about to celebrate his nuptials
               with exceeding great pomp, bethought him that he could not do
               better than, to avoid a repetition of the pomp and expense, arrange, if
               so he might, that his brother should be wedded on the same day
               with himself. So, having consulted anew with Cassandra's kinsfolk,
               and come to an understanding with them, he and his brother and
               they conferred together, and agreed that on the same day that
               Pasimondas married Iphigenia, Hormisdas should marry Cassandra.
               Lysimachus, getting wind of this arrangement, was mortified beyond
               measure, seeing himself thereby deprived of the hope which he cherished
               of marrying Cassandra himself, if Hormisdas should not forestall
               him. But like a wise man he concealed his chagrin, and cast about
               how he might frustrate the arrangement: to which end he saw no
               other possible means but to carry Cassandra off. It did not escape
               him that the office which he held would render this easily feasible,
               but he deemed it all the more dishonourable than if he had not held
               the office; but, in short, after much pondering, honour yielded place
               to love, and he made up his mind that, come what might, he would
               carry Cassandra off. Then, as he took thought what company he
               should take with him, and how he should go about the affair, he
               remembered Cimon, whom he had in prison with his men, and it
               occurred to him that he could not possibly have a better or more trusty
               associate in such an enterprise than Cimon. Wherefore the same night
               he caused Cimon to be brought privily to him in his own room, and
               thus addressed him: Cimon, as the gods are most generous and
               liberal to bestow their gifts on men, so are they also most sagacious
               to try their virtue; and those whom they find to be firm and steadfast
               in all circumstances they honour, as the most worthy, with the
               highest rewards. They have been minded to be certified of thy
               worth by better proofs than thou couldst afford them, as long as thy
               life was bounded by thy father's house amid the superabundant wealth
               which I know him to possess: wherefore in the first place they so
               wrought upon thee with the shrewd incitements of Love that from an
               insensate brute, as I have heard, thou grewest to be a man; since
               when, it has been and is their intent to try whether evil fortune and
               harsh imprisonment may avail to change thee from the temper that was
               thine when for a short while thou hadst joyance of the prize
               thou hadst won. And so thou prove the same that thou wast then,
               they have in store for thee a boon incomparably greater than aught
               that they vouchsafed thee before: what that boon is, to the end thou
               mayst recover heart and thy wonted energies, I will now explain to
               thee. Pasimondas, exultant in thy misfortune and eager to compass thy
               death, hastens to the best of his power his nuptials with thy Iphigenia;
               that so he may enjoy the prize that Fortune, erstwhile smiling, gave
               thee, and forthwith, frowning, reft from thee. Whereat how sore
               must be thy grief, if rightly I gauge thy love, I know by my own
               case, seeing that his brother Hormisdas addresses himself to do me on
               the same day a like wrong in regard of Cassandra, whom I love more
               than aught else in the world. Nor see I that Fortune has left us
               any way of escape from this her unjust and cruel spite, save what we
               may make for ourselves by a resolved spirit and the might of our
               right hands: take we then the sword, and therewith make we, each,
               prize of his lady, thou for the second, I for the first time: for so thou
               value the recovery, I say not of thy liberty, for without thy lady I doubt
               thou wouldst hold it cheap, but of thy lady, the gods have placed it in
               thine own hands, if thou art but minded to join me in my enterprise.
            </p>
            <p>These words restored to Cimon all that he had lost of heart and
               hope, nor pondered he long, before he replied: Lysimachus, comrade
               stouter or more staunch than I thou mightst not have in such
               an enterprise, if such indeed it be as thou sayst: wherefore lay upon
               me such behest as thou shalt deem meet, and thou shalt marvel to
               witness the vigour of my performance. 
               Whereupon Lysimachus:
               On the third day from now, quoth he, their husbands' houses
               will be newly entered by the brides, and on the same day at even we
               too will enter them in arms, thou with thy men, and I with some of
               mine, in whom I place great trust, and forcing our way among the
               guests and slaughtering all that dare to oppose us, will bear the ladies
               off to a ship which I have had privily got ready. 
               Cimon approved
               the plan, and kept quiet in prison until the appointed time; 
               which being come, the nuptials were celebrated with great pomp and
               magnificence, that filled the houses of the two brothers with festal
               cheer. Then Lysimachus having made ready all things meet, and fired
               Cimon and his men and his own friends for the enterprise by a long
               harangue, disposed them in due time, all bearing arms under their
               cloaks,
               in three companies; and having privily despatched one company
               to the port, that, when the time should come to embark, he might
               meet with no let, he marched with the other two companies to the
               house of Pasimondas, posted the one company at the gate, that, being
               entered, they might not be shut in or debarred their egress, and, with
               the other company and Cimon, ascended the stairs, and gained the
               saloon, where the brides and not a few other ladies were set at several
               tables to sup in meet order: whereupon in they rushed, and overthrew
               the tables and seized each his own lady, and placed them in
               charge of their men, whom they bade bear them off forthwith to the
               ship that lay ready to receive them. Whereupon the brides and the
               other ladies and the servants with one accord fell a sobbing and
               shrieking, insomuch that a confused din and lamentation filled the
               whole place. Cimon, Lysimachus and their band, none withstanding,
               but all giving way before them, gained the stairs, which they were
               already descending when they encountered Pasimondas, who, carrying
               a great staff in his hand, was making in the direction of the noise;
               but one doughty stroke of Cimon's sword sufficed to cleave his skull
               in twain, and lay him dead at Cimon's feet, and another stroke
               disposed of hapless Hormisdas, as he came running to his brother's
               aid. Some others who ventured to approach them were wounded
               and beaten off by the retinue. So forth of the house, that reeked
               with blood and resounded with tumult and lamentation and woe,
               sped Simon and Lysimachus with all their company, and without any
               let, in close order, with their fair booty in their midst, made good
               their retreat to the ship; whereon with the ladies they one and all
               embarked, for the shore was now full of armed men come to rescue
               the ladies, and, the oarsmen giving way, put to sea elate. 
               Arrived at
               <span class="place">Crete</span>, they met with a hearty welcome on the part of their many
               friends and kinsfolk; and, having married their ladies, they made
               greatly merry, and had gladsome joyance of their fair booty. Their
               doings occasioned, both in <span class="place">Cyprus</span> and in <span class="place">Rhodes</span>, no small stir and
               commotion, which lasted for a long while: but in the end, by the
               good offices of their friends and kinsfolk in both islands, 'twas so
               ordered as that after a certain term of exile Cimon returned with
               Iphigenia to <span class="place">Cyprus</span>, and in like manner Lysimachus returned with
               Cassandra to <span class="place">Rhodes</span>; and long and blithely thereafter lived they,
               each well contented with his own wife in his own land.

            <p>You are to know then, dainty ladies, that not far from <span class="place">Sicily</span> there is
               an islet called <span class="place">Lipari</span>, in which, no great while ago, there dwelt a
               damsel, Gostanza by name, fair as fair could be, and of one of the
               most honourable families in the island. And one Martuccio Gomito,
               who was also of the island, a young man most gallant and courteous,
               and worthy for his condition, became enamoured of Gostanza; 
               who in like manner grew so afire for him that she was ever ill at ease,
               except she saw him. Martuccio, craving her to wife, asked her of
               her father, who made answer that, Martuccio being poor, he was not
               minded to give her to him. 
               Mortified to be thus rejected by reason
               of poverty, Martuccio took an oath in presence of some of his friends
               and kinsfolk that <span class="place">Lipari</span> should know him no more, until he was
               wealthy. So away he sailed, and took to scouring the seas as a rover
               on the coast of Barbary, preying upon all whose force matched not his
               own. In which way of life he found Fortune favourable enough,
               had he but known how to rest and be thankful: but 'twas not
               enough that he and his comrades in no long time waxed very
               wealthy; their covetousness was inordinate, and, while they sought
               to gratify it, they chanced in an encounter with certain Saracen ships
               to be taken after a long defence, and despoiled, and, most part of
               them, thrown into the sea by their captors, who, after sinking his
               ship, took Martuccio with them to <span class="place">Tunis</span>, and clapped him in prison,
               and there kept him a long time in a very sad plight.
            </p>
            <p>Meanwhile, not by one or two, but by divers and not a few
               persons, tidings reached <span class="place">Lipari</span> that all that were with Martuccio
               aboard his bark had perished in the sea. The damsel, whose grief on
               Martuccio's departure had known no bounds, now hearing that he was
               dead with the rest, wept a great while, and made up her mind to
               have done with life; but, lacking the resolution to lay violent hands
               upon herself, she bethought her how she might devote herself to
               death by some novel expedient. So one night she stole out of her
               father's house, and hied her to the port, and there by chance she
               found, lying a little apart from the other craft, a fishing boat, which,
               as the owners had but just quitted her, was still equipped with mast
               and sails and oars. Aboard which boat she forthwith got, and being,
               like most of the women of the island, not altogether without nautical
               skill, she rowed some distance out to sea, and then hoisted sail, and
               cast away oars and tiller, and let the boat drift, deeming that a boat
               without lading or steersman would certainly be either capsized by
               the wind or dashed against some rock and broken in pieces, so that
               escape she could not, even if she would, but must perforce drown.
               And so, her head wrapped in a mantle, she stretched herself weeping
               on the floor of the boat. But it fell out quite otherwise than she
               had conjectured: for, the wind being from the north, and very
               equable, with next to no sea, the boat kept an even keel, and next
               day about vespers bore her to land hard by a city called <span class="place">Susa</span>, full a
               hundred miles beyond <span class="place">Tunis</span>. To the damsel 'twas all one whether
               she were at sea or ashore, for, since she had been aboard, she had
               never once raised, nor, come what might, meant she ever to raise,
               her head.
            </p>
            <p>Now it so chanced, that, when the boat grounded, there was on
               the shore a poor woman that was in the employ of some fishermen, whose
               nets she was just taking out of the sunlight. Seeing the
               boat under full sail, she marvelled how it should be suffered to drive
               ashore, and conjectured that the fishermen on board were asleep. So
               to the boat she hied her, and finding therein only the damsel fast
               asleep, she called her many times, and at length awakened her; and
               perceiving by her dress that she was a Christian, she asked her in
               Latin how it was that she was come thither all alone in the boat.
               Hearing the Latin speech, the damsel wondered whether the wind
               had not shifted, and carried her back to <span class="place">Lipari</span>: so up she started,
               gazed about her, and finding herself ashore and the aspect of the
               country strange, asked the good woman where she was. To which
               the good woman made answer: My daughter, thou art hard by
               <span class="place">Susa</span> in Barbary. 
               Whereupon the damsel, sorrowful that God had
               not seen fit to accord her the boon of death, apprehensive of dishonour,
               and at her wits' end, sat herself down at the foot of her
               boat, and burst into tears. Which the good woman saw not without
               pity, and persuaded her to come with her into her hut, and there by
               coaxing drew from her how she was come thither; and knowing
               that she could not but be fasting, she set before her her own coarse
               bread and some fish and water, and prevailed upon her to eat a little.
               Gostanza thereupon asked her, who she was that thus spoke Latin;
               whereto she answered that her name was <span class="person">Carapresa</span>, and that she
               was from <span class="place">Trapani</span>, where she had served some Christian fishermen.
               To the damsel, sad indeed though she was, this name <span class="person">Carapresa</span>,
               wherefore she knew not, seemed to be of happy augury, so that she
               began to take hope, she knew not why, and to grow somewhat less
               fain of death: wherefore without disclosing who or whence she was,
               she earnestly besought the good woman for the love of God to have
               pity on her youth, and advise her how best to avoid insult. 
               Whereupon
               <span class="person">Carapresa</span>, good woman that she was, left her in her hut, while
               with all speed she picked up her nets; and on her return she wrapped
               her in her own mantle, and led her to <span class="place">Susa</span>. 
               Arrived there, she said
               to her: Gostanza, I shall bring thee to the house of an excellent
               Saracen lady, for whom I frequently do bits of work, as she has
               occasion: she is an old lady and compassionate: I will commend
               thee to her care as best I may, and I doubt not she will right gladly
               receive thee, and entreat thee as her daughter: and thou wilt serve
               her, and, while thou art with her, do all thou canst to gain her favour,
               until
               such time as God may send thee better fortune; and as she
               said, so she did.
            </p>
            <p>The old lady listened, and then, gazing steadfastly in the damsel's
               face, shed tears, and taking her hand, kissed her forehead, and led her
               into the house, where she and some other women dwelt quite by
               themselves, doing divers kinds of handiwork in silk and palm leaves
               and leather. Wherein the damsel in a few days acquired some skill,
               and thenceforth wrought together with them; and rose wondrous
               high in the favour and good graces of all the ladies, who soon taught
               her their language.
            </p>
            <p>Now while the damsel, mourned at home as lost and dead, dwelt
               thus at <span class="place">Susa</span>, it so befell that, Mariabdela being then King of <span class="place">Tunis</span>,
               a young chieftain in <span class="place">Granada</span>, of great power, and backed by mighty
               allies, gave out that the realm of <span class="place">Tunis</span> belonged to him, and having
               gathered a vast army, made a descent upon <span class="place">Tunis</span> with intent to
               expel the King from the realm. Martuccio Gomito, who knew the
               language of Barbary well, heard the tidings in prison, and learning
               that the King of <span class="place">Tunis</span> was mustering a mighty host for the defence
               of his kingdom, said to one of the warders that were in charge of
               him and his comrades: If I might have speech of the King, I am
               confident that the advice that I should give him would secure him
               the victory. The warder repeated these words to his chief, who
               forthwith carried them to the King. Wherefore by the King's command
               Martuccio was brought before him, and being asked by him
               what the advice, of which he had spoken, might be, answered on
               this wise: Sire, if in old days, when I was wont to visit this
               country of yours, I duly observed the manner in which you order
               your battle, methinks you place your main reliance upon archers;
               and therefore, if you could contrive that your enemy's supply of
               arrows should give out and your own continue plentiful, I apprehend
               that you would win the battle. Ay indeed, replied the King, I
               make no doubt that, could I but accomplish that, I should conquer.
               Nay but, Sire, returned Martuccio, you may do it, if you will.
               Listen, and I will tell you how. You must fit the bows of your
               archers with strings much finer than those that are in common use,
               and match them with arrows, the notches of which will not admit
               any but these fine strings; and this you must do so secretly that
               your enemy may not know it, else he will find means to be even with
               you.  Which counsel I give you for the following reason:
               When your and your enemy's archers have expended all their arrows,
               you wot that the enemy will fall to picking up the arrows that your
               men have shot during the battle, and your men will do the like by
               the enemy's arrows;  but the enemy will not be able to make use of
               your men's arrows, by reason that their fine notches will not suffice
               to admit the stout strings, whereas your men will be in the contrary
               case in regard of the enemy's arrows, for the fine string will very
               well receive the large-notched arrow, and so your men will have
               an abundant supply of arrows, while the enemy will be at a loss for
               them.
            </p>
            <p>The King, who lacked not sagacity, appreciated Martuccio's
               advice, and gave full effect to it; whereby he came out of the war
               a conqueror, and Martuccio, being raised to the chief place in his
               favour, waxed rich and powerful.  Which matters being bruited
               throughout the country, it came to the ears of Gostanza that Martuccio
               Gomito, whom she had long supposed to be dead, was alive;
               whereby her love for him, some embers of which still lurked in her
               heart, burst forth again in sudden flame, and gathered strength, and
               revived her dead hope.  Wherefore she frankly told all her case to
               the good lady with whom she dwelt, saying that she would fain go
               to <span class="place">Tunis</span>, that her eyes might have assurance of that which the
               report received by her ears had made them yearn to see.  The lady
               fell heartily in with the girl's desire, and, as if she had been her
               mother, embarked with her for <span class="place">Tunis</span>, where on their arrival they
               were honourably received in the house of one of her kinswomen.
               <span class="person">Carapresa</span>, who had attended her, being sent to discover what she
               might touching Martuccio, brought back word that he was alive, and
               high in honour and place. The gentlewoman was minded that none
               but herself should apprise Martuccio of the arrival of his Gostanza:
               wherefore she hied her one day to Martuccio, and said: Martuccio,
               there is come to my house a servant of thine from <span class="place">Lipari</span>,
               who would fain speak with thee here privily, and for that he would
               not have me trust another, I am come hither myself to deliver his
               message. Martuccio thanked her, and forthwith hied him with her
               to her house:  where no sooner did the girl see him than she all
               but died for joy, and carried away by her feelings, fell upon his neck
               with open arms and embraced him, and, what with sorrow of his past
               woes and her present happiness, said never a word, but softly
               wept.  Martuccio regarded her for a while in silent wonder; then,
               heaving a sigh, he said: Thou livest then, my Gostanza? Long
               since I heard that thou wast lost; nor was aught known of thee
               at home. Which said, he tenderly and with tears embraced her.
               Gostanza told him all her adventures, and how honourably she had
               been entreated by the gentlewoman with whom she had dwelt.
               And so long time they conversed, and then Martuccio parted
               from her, and hied him back to his lord the King, and told him
               all, to wit, his own adventures and those of the girl, adding that
               with his leave he was minded to marry her according to our law.
               Which matters the King found passing strange; and having called
               the girl to him, and learned from her that 'twas even as Martuccio
               had said: Well indeed, quoth he, hast thou won thy husband.
               Then caused he gifts most ample and excellent to be brought forth,
               part of which he gave to Gostanza, and part to Martuccio, leaving
               them entirely to their own devices in regard of one another.  Then
               Martuccio, in terms most honourable, bade farewell to the old lady
               with whom Gostanza had dwelt, thanking her for the service she
               had rendered to Gostanza, and giving her presents suited to her condition,
               and commending her to God, while Gostanza shed many a
               tear: after which, by leave of the King, they went aboard a light
               bark, taking with them <span class="person">Carapresa</span>, and, sped by a prosperous breeze,
               arrived at <span class="place">Lipari</span>, where they were received with such cheer as 'twere
               vain to attempt to describe.  There were Martuccio and Gostanza
               wedded with all pomp and splendour; and there long time in
               easeful peace they had joyance of their love.

               reference to the forlorn condition of the city while the seat of the
               papacy was at <span class="place">Avignon</span>, 1308-1377.
               was of yore the head, of the world, there dwelt a young man, Pietro
               Boccamazza by name, a scion of one of the most illustrious of the
               Roman houses, who became enamoured of a damsel exceeding fair, and
               amorous withal--her name <span class="person">Agnolella</span>--the daughter of one Gigliuozzo
               Saullo, a plebeian, but in high repute among the Romans.  Nor, loving
               thus, did Pietro lack the address to inspire in <span class="person">Agnolella</span> a love as ardent
               as his own.  Wherefore, overmastered by his passion, and minded no
               longer to endure the sore suffering that it caused him, he asked her
               in marriage. Whereof his kinsfolk were no sooner apprised, than
               with one accord they came to him and strongly urged him to desist
               from his purpose: they also gave Gigliuozzo Saullo to understand that
               he were best to pay no sort of heed to Pietro's words, for that,
               if he so did, they would never acknowledge him as friend or relative.
               Thus to see himself debarred of the one way by which he deemed
               he might attain to his desire, Pietro was ready to die for grief, and,
               all his kinsfolk notwithstanding, he would have married Gigliuozzo's
               daughter, had but the father consented.  Wherefore at length he
               made up his mind that, if the girl were willing, nought should stand
               in the way; and having through a common friend sounded the
               damsel and found her apt, he brought her to consent to elope with
               him from <span class="place">Rome</span>.  The affair being arranged, Pietro and she took
               horse betimes one morning, and sallied forth for Anagni, where
               Pietro had certain friends, in whom he placed much trust; and as
               they rode, time not serving for full joyance of their love, for they
               feared pursuit, they held converse thereof, and from time to time
               exchanged a kiss.  Now it so befell, that, the way being none too
               well known to Pietro, when, perhaps eight miles from <span class="place">Rome</span>, they
               should have turned to the right, they took instead a leftward road.
               Whereon when they had ridden but little more than two miles, they
               found themselves close to a petty castle, whence, so soon as they
               were observed, there issued some dozen men at arms;  and, as they
               drew near, the damsel, espying them, gave a cry, and said: We are
               attacked, Pietro, let us flee; and guiding her nag as best she knew
               towards a great forest, she planted the spurs in his sides, and so, holding
               on by the saddle-bow, was borne by the goaded creature into the
               forest at a gallop.  Pietro, who had been too engrossed with her face
               to give due heed to the way, and thus had not been ware, as soon as
               she, of the approach of the men at arms, was still looking about to
               see whence they were coming, when they came up with him, and
               took him prisoner, and forced him to dismount. Then they asked
               who he was, and, when he told them, they conferred among themselves,
               saying: This is one of the friends of our enemies: what
               else can we do but relieve him of his nag and of his clothes, and hang
               him on one of these oaks in scorn of the Orsini?  To which
               proposal all agreeing, they bade Pietro strip himself: but while,
               already divining his fate, he was so doing, an ambuscade of full
               five-and-twenty
               men at arms fell suddenly upon them, crying: Death,
               death! Thus surprised, they let Pietro go, and stood on the
               defensive; but, seeing that the enemy greatly outnumbered them, they
               took to their heels, the others giving chase. Whereupon Pietro
               hastily resumed his clothes, mounted his nag, and fled with all speed
               in the direction which he had seen the damsel take.  But finding no
               road or path through the forest, nor discerning any trace of a horse's
               hooves, he was--for that he found not the damsel--albeit he deemed
               himself safe out of the clutches of his captors and their assailants, the
               most wretched man alive, and fell a weeping and wandering hither and
               thither about the forest, uttering <span class="person">Agnolella</span>'s name.  None answered;
               but turn back he dared not: so on he went, not knowing whither
               he went; besides which, he was in mortal dread of the wild beasts
               that infest the forest, as well on account of himself as of the damsel,
               whom momently he seemed to see throttled by some bear or wolf.
               Thus did our unfortunate Pietro spend the whole day, wandering
               about the forest, making it to resound with his cries of <span class="person">Agnolella</span>'s
               name, and harking at times back, when he thought to go forward;
               until at last, what with his cries and his tears and his fears and his
               long fasting, he was so spent that he could go no further.  'Twas
               then nightfall, and, as he knew not what else to do, he dismounted
               at the foot of an immense oak, and having tethered his nag to the
               trunk, climbed up into the branches, lest he should be devoured by
               the wild beasts during the night.  Shortly afterwards the moon rose
               with a very clear sky, and Pietro, who dared not sleep, lest he should
               fall, and indeed, had he been secure from that risk, his misery and
               his anxiety on account of the damsel would not have suffered him to
               sleep, kept watch, sighing and weeping and cursing his evil luck.
            </p>
            <p>Now the damsel, who, as we said before, had fled she knew not
               whither, allowing her nag to carry her whithersoever he would,
               strayed so far into the forest that she lost sight of the place where
               she had entered it, and spent the whole day just as Pietro had done,
               wandering about the wilderness, pausing from time to time, and
               weeping, and uttering his name, and bewailing her evil fortune.  At
               last, seeing that 'twas now the vesper hour and Pietro came not, she
               struck into a path, which the nag followed, until, after riding some
               two miles, she espied at some distance a cottage, for which she made
               with all speed, and found there a good man, well stricken in years,
               with his wife, who was likewise aged.  Seeing her ride up alone,
               they said: Daughter, wherefore ridest thou thus alone at this
               hour in these parts?  Weeping, the damsel made answer that she had
               lost her companion in the forest, and asked how far might
               Anagni be from there? My daughter, returned the good man,
               this is not the road to Anagni; 'tis more than twelve miles away.
               And how far off, inquired the damsel, are the nearest houses in
               which one might find lodging for the night? There are none
               so near, replied the good man, that thou canst reach them to-day.
               Then, so please you, said the damsel, since go elsewhither I
               cannot, for God's sake let me pass the night here with you.  Whereto
               the good man made answer: Damsel, welcome art thou to tarry
               the night with us; but still thou art to know that these parts are infested
               both by day and by night by bands, which, be they friends or be they
               foes, are alike ill to meet with, and not seldom do much despite and
               mischief, and if by misadventure one of these bands should visit us
               while thou wert here, and marking thy youth and beauty should do
               thee despite and dishonour, we should be unable to afford thee any
               succour.  This we would have thee know, that if it should so come
               to pass, thou mayst not have cause to reproach us.  The damsel
               heard not the old man's words without dismay; but, seeing that the
               hour was now late, she answered: God, if He be so pleased, will
               save both you and me from such molestation, and if not, 'tis a much
               lesser evil to be maltreated by men than to be torn in pieces by the
               wild beasts in the forest.  So saying, she dismounted, and entered
               the cottage, where, having supped with the poor man and his wife
               on such humble fare as they had, she laid herself in her clothes
               beside them in their bed. She slept not, however; for her own evil
               plight and that of Pietro, for whom she knew not how to augur
               aught but evil, kept her sighing and weeping all night long.  And
               towards matins she heard a great noise as of men that marched; so
               up she got and hied her into a large courtyard that was in rear of the
               cottage, and part of which was covered with a great heap of hay,
               which she espying, hid herself therein, that, if the men came there,
               they might not so readily find her.  Scarce had she done so than the
               men, who proved to be a strong company of marauders, were at the
               door of the cottage, which they forced open; and having entered,
               and found the damsel's nag, still saddled, they asked who was there.
               The damsel being out of sight, the good man answered: There
               is none here but my wife and I; but this nag, which has given some
               one the slip, found his way hither last night, and we housed him, lest
               he
               should be devoured by the wolves. So! said the chief of the
               band, as he has no owner, he will come in very handy for us.
            </p>
            <p>Whereupon, in several parties, they ransacked the cottage from
               top to bottom; and one party went out into the courtyard, where,
               as they threw aside their lances and targets, it so befell that one of
               them, not knowing where else to bestow his lance, tossed it into the
               hay, and was within an ace of killing the damsel that lay hid there,
               as likewise she of betraying her whereabouts, for the lance all but
               grazing her left breast, insomuch that the head tore her apparel, she
               doubted she was wounded, and had given a great shriek, but that,
               remembering where she was, she refrained for fear.  By and by the
               company cooked them a breakfast of kid's and other meat, and having
               eaten and drunken, dispersed in divers directions, as their affairs
               required, taking the girl's nag with them.  And when they were
               gotten some little way off, the good man asked his wife: What
               became of the damsel, our guest of last night, that I have not seen
               her since we rose?  The good woman answered that she knew
               not where the damsel was, and went to look for her.  The damsel,
               discovering that the men were gone, came forth of the hay, and
               the good man, seeing her, was overjoyed that she had not fallen into
               the hands of the ruffians, and, as day was breaking, said to her:
               Now that day is at hand, we will, so it like thee, escort thee to a
               castle, some five miles hence, where thou wilt be in safety; but thou
               must needs go afoot, because these villains, that are but just gone,
               have taken thy nag with them.  The damsel, resigning herself to
               her loss, besought them for God's sake to take her to the castle:
               whereupon they set forth, and arrived there about half tierce.  Now
               the castle belonged to one of the Orsini, Liello di Campo di Fiore
               by name, whose wife, as it chanced, was there. A most kindly
               and good woman she was, and, recognizing the damsel as soon as she
               saw her, gave her a hearty welcome and would fain have from her a
               particular account of how she came there.  So the damsel told her
               the whole story. The lady, to whom Pietro was also known, as
               being a friend of her husband, was distressed to hear of his misadventure,
               and being told where he was taken, gave him up for dead.
               So she said to the damsel: Since so it is that thou knowest not
               how Pietro has fared, thou shalt stay here with me until such time
               as I may have opportunity to send thee safely back to <span class="place">Rome</span>.
            </p>
            <p>Meanwhile Pietro, perched on his oak in as woeful a plight as
               might be, had espied, when he should have been in his first sleep, a
               full score of wolves, that, as they prowled, caught sight of the nag,
               and straightway were upon him on all sides.  The horse, as soon as he
               was ware of their approach, strained on the reins till they snapped,
               and tried to make good his escape; but, being hemmed in, was
               brought to bay, and made a long fight of it with his teeth and hooves;
               but in the end they bore him down and throttled him and forthwith
               eviscerated him, and, the whole pack falling upon him, devoured him
               to the bone before they had done with him.  Whereat Pietro, who
               felt that in the nag he had lost a companion and a comfort in his
               travail, was sorely dismayed, and began to think that he should never
               get out of the forest.  But towards dawn, he, perched there in the
               oak, almost dead with cold, looking around him as he frequently did,
               espied about a mile off a huge fire. Wherefore, as soon as 'twas
               broad day, he got down, not without trepidation, from the oak, and
               bent his steps towards the fire; and being come to it, he found,
               gathered about it, a company of shepherds, eating and making merry,
               who took pity on him and made him welcome.  And when he had
               broken his fast and warmed himself, he told them the mishap that
               had befallen him, and how it was that he was come there alone, and
               asked them if there was a farm or castle in those parts, whither he
               might betake him.  The shepherds said that about three miles away
               there was a castle belonging to Liello di Campo di Fiore, where his lady
               was then tarrying. Pietro, much comforted, requested to be guided
               thither by some of their company; whereupon two of them right
               gladly escorted him.  So Pietro arrived at the castle, where he found
               some that knew him; and while he was endeavouring to set on foot
               a search for the damsel in the forest, the lady summoned him to her
               presence, and he, forthwith obeying, and seeing <span class="person">Agnolella</span> with her,
               was the happiest man that ever was.  He yearned till he all but
               swooned to go and embrace her, but refrained, for bashfulness, in the
               lady's presence. And overjoyed as he was, the joy of the damsel
               was no less.  The lady received him with great cheer, and though,
               when she had heard the story of his adventures from his own lips, she
               chid him not a little for having set at nought the wishes of his kinsfolk;
               yet, seeing that he was still of the same mind, and that the
               damsel was also constant, she said to herself: To what purpose give
               I myself all this trouble? they love one another, they know
               one another; they love with equal ardour; their love is honourable,
               and I doubt not is well pleasing to God, seeing that the one has
               escaped the gallows and the other the lance, and both the wild beasts:
               wherefore be it as they would have it.  Then, turning to them, she
               said: If 'tis your will to be joined in wedlock as man and wife,
               mine jumps with it: here shall your nuptials be solemnized and at
               Liello's charges, and for the rest I will see that your peace is made
               with your kinsfolk.  So in the castle the pair were wedded, Pietro
               only less blithe than <span class="person">Agnolella</span>, the lady ordering the nuptials as
               honourably as might be in her mountain-home, and there they had
               most sweet joyance of the first fruits of their love.  So some days
               they tarried there, and then accompanied by the lady with a strong
               escort, they took horse and returned to <span class="place">Rome</span>, where, very wroth
               though she found Pietro's kinsfolk for what he had done, the lady
               re-established solid peace between him and them; and so at <span class="place">Rome</span>
               Pietro and <span class="person">Agnolella</span> lived together to a good old age in great
               tranquillity and happiness.

            <p>Know then, noble ladies, that 'tis no long time since there dwelt
               in <span class="place">Romagna</span> a right worthy and courteous knight, Messer Lizio da
               Valbona by name, who was already verging upon old age, when, as it
               happened, there was born to him of his wife, Madonna Giacomina,
               a daughter, who, as she grew up, became the fairest and most debonair
               of all the girls of those parts, and, for that she was the only daughter
               left to them, was most dearly loved and cherished by her father and
               mother, who guarded her with most jealous care, thinking to arrange
               some great match for her.  Now there was frequently in Messer
               Lizio's house, and much in his company, a fine, lusty young man,
               one Ricciardo de' Manardi da Brettinoro, whom Messer Lizio and
               his wife would as little have thought of mistrusting as if he had been
               their own son: who, now and again taking note of the damsel, that
               she was very fair and graceful, and in bearing and behaviour most
               commendable, and of marriageable age, fell vehemently in love with
               her, which love he was very careful to conceal.  The damsel detected
               it, however, and in like manner plunged headlong into love with
               him, to Ricciardo's no small satisfaction.  Again and again he was
               on the point of speaking to her, but refrained for fear; at length,
               however, he summoned up his courage, and seizing his opportunity,
               thus addressed her: Caterina, I implore thee, suffer me not to
               die for love of thee.  Whereto the damsel forthwith responded:
               Nay, God grant that it be not rather that I die for love of thee.
               Greatly exhilarated and encouraged, Ricciardo made answer:
               'Twill never be by default of mine that thou lackest aught that
               may pleasure thee; but it rests with thee to find the means to save
               thy life and mine.  Then said the damsel: Thou seest, Ricciardo,
               how closely watched I am, insomuch that I see not how 'twere
               possible for thee to come to me; but if thou seest aught that I may
               do without dishonour, speak the word, and I will do it.  Ricciardo
               was silent a while, pondering many matters: then, of a sudden, he
               said: Sweet my Caterina, there is but one way that I can see,
               to wit, that thou shouldst sleep either on or where thou mightst have
               access to the terrace by thy father's garden, where, so I but knew
               that thou wouldst be there at night, I would without fail contrive
               to meet thee, albeit 'tis very high. As for my sleeping there,
               replied Caterina, I doubt not that it may be managed, if thou art
               sure that thou canst join me.  Ricciardo answered in the affirmative.
               Whereupon they exchanged a furtive kiss, and parted.
            </p>
            <p>On the morrow, it being now towards the close of May, the
               damsel began complaining to her mother that by reason of the
               excessive heat she had not been able to get any sleep during the
               night. Daughter, said the lady, what heat was there? Nay,
               there was no heat at all. Had you said, 'to my thinking,'
               mother, rejoined Caterina, you would perhaps have said sooth;
               but you should bethink you how much more heat girls have in them
               than ladies that are advanced in years. True, my daughter,
               returned the lady, but I cannot order that it shall be hot and cold,
               as thou perchance wouldst like; we must take the weather as we
               find it, and as the seasons provide it: perchance to-night it will be
               cooler, and thou wilt sleep better. God grant it be so, said
               Caterina, but 'tis not wonted for the nights to grow cooler as the
               summer comes on. What then, said the lady, wouldst thou
               have me do? With your leave and my father's, answered
               Caterina, I should like to have a little bed made up on the terrace
               by his room and over his garden, where, hearing the nightingales
               sing, and being in a much cooler place, I should sleep much better
               than in your room.  Whereupon: Daughter, be of good cheer,
               said the mother; I will speak to thy father, and we will do as he
               shall decide.  So the lady told Messer Lizio what had passed between
               her and the damsel; but he, being old and perhaps for that reason
               a little morose, said: What nightingale is this, to whose chant
               she would fain sleep? I will see to it that the cicalas shall yet lull
               her to sleep.  Which speech, coming to Caterina's ears, gave her
               such offence, that for anger, rather than by reason of the heat, she
               not only slept not herself that night, but suffered not her mother to
               sleep, keeping up a perpetual complaint of the great heat.  Wherefore
               her mother hied her in the morning to Messer Lizio, and said
               to him: Sir, you hold your daughter none too dear; what difference
               can it make to you that she lie on the terrace? She has tossed
               about all night long by reason of the heat; and besides, can you
               wonder that she, girl that she is, loves to hear the nightingale sing?
               Young folk naturally affect their likes.  Whereto Messer Lizio
               made answer: Go, make her a bed there to your liking, and set
               a curtain round it, and let her sleep there, and hear the nightingale
               sing to her heart's content.  Which the damsel no sooner learned,
               than she had a bed made there with intent to sleep there that same
               night; wherefore she watched until she saw Ricciardo, whom by a
               concerted sign she gave to understand what he was to do.  Messer
               Lizio, as soon as he had heard the damsel go to bed, locked a door
               that led from his room to the terrace, and went to sleep himself.
               When all was quiet, Ricciardo with the help of a ladder got upon
               a wall, and standing thereon laid hold of certain toothings of another
               wall, and not without great exertion and risk, had he fallen, clambered
               up on to the terrace, where the damsel received him quietly with
               the heartiest of cheer. Many a kiss they exchanged; and then got
               them to bed, where well-nigh all night long they had solace and
               joyance of one another, and made the nightingale sing not a few
               times.  But, brief being the night and great their pleasure, towards
               dawn, albeit they wist it not, they fell asleep, Caterina's right arm
               encircling Ricciardo's neck, while with her left hand she held him
               by that part of his person which your modesty, my ladies, is most
               averse to name in the company of men.  So, peacefully they slept,
               and were still asleep when day broke and Messer Lizio rose; and
               calling to mind that his daughter slept on the terrace, softly opened
               the door, saying to himself: Let me see what sort of night's rest
               the nightingale has afforded our Caterina?  And having entered,
               he gently raised the curtain that screened the bed, and saw Ricciardo
               asleep with her and in her embrace as described, both being quite
               naked and uncovered;  and having taken note of Ricciardo, he went
               away, and hied him to his lady's room, and called her, saying: Up,
               up, wife, come and see; for thy daughter has fancied the nightingale
               to such purpose that she has caught him, and holds him in her hand.
               How can this be? said the lady.  Come quickly, and thou shalt
               see, replied Messer Lizio.  So the lady huddled on her clothes, and
               silently followed Messer Lizio, and when they were come to the
               bed, and had raised the curtain, Madonna Giacomina saw plainly
               enough how her daughter had caught, and did hold the nightingale,
               whose song she had so longed to hear.  Whereat the lady, deeming
               that Ricciardo had played her a cruel trick, would have cried out
               and upbraided him; but Messer Lizio said to her: Wife, as thou
               valuest my love, say not a word; for in good sooth, seeing that she
               has caught him, he shall be hers.  Ricciardo is a gentleman and
               wealthy; an alliance with him cannot but be to our advantage: if
               he would part from me on good terms, he must first marry her, so
               that the nightingale shall prove to have been put in his own cage
               and not in that of another.  Whereby the lady was reassured, seeing
               that her husband took the affair so quietly, and that her daughter had
               had a good night, and was rested, and had caught the nightingale.
               So she kept silence;  nor had they long to wait before Ricciardo
               awoke; and, seeing that 'twas broad day, deemed that 'twas as much
               as his life was worth, and aroused Caterina, saying: Alas! my
               soul, what shall we do, now that day has come and surprised me
               here?  Which question Messer Lizio answered by coming forward,
               and saying: We shall do well.  At sight of him Ricciardo felt
               as if his heart were torn out of his body, and sate up in the bed, and
               said: My lord, I cry you mercy for God's sake. I wot that my
               disloyalty and delinquency have merited death; wherefore deal with
               me even as it may seem best to you: however, I pray you, if so it
               may be, to spare my life, that I die not. Ricciardo, replied
               Messer
               Lizio, the love I bore thee, and the faith I reposed in thee, merited
               a better return; but still, as so it is, and youth has seduced thee into
               such a transgression, redeem thy life, and preserve my honour, by
               making Caterina thy lawful spouse, that thine, as she has been for
               this past night, she may remain for the rest of her life. In this way
               thou mayst secure my peace and thy safety; otherwise commend thy
               soul to God.  Pending this colloquy, Caterina let go the nightingale,
               and having covered herself, began with many a tear to implore her
               father to forgive Ricciardo, and Ricciardo to do as Messer Lizio
               required, that thereby they might securely count upon a long continuance
               of such nights of delight.  But there needed not much
               supplication; for, what with remorse for the wrong done, and the
               wish to make amends, and the fear of death, and the desire to escape
               it, and above all ardent love, and the craving to possess the beloved
               one, Ricciardo lost no time in making frank avowal of his readiness
               to do as Messer Lizio would have him.  Wherefore Messer Lizio,
               having borrowed a ring from Madonna Giacomina, Ricciardo did
               there and then in their presence wed Caterina.  Which done, Messer
               Lizio and the lady took their leave, saying: Now rest ye a while;
               for so perchance 'twere better for you than if ye rose.  And so
               they left the young folks, who forthwith embraced, and not having
               travelled more than six miles during the night, went two miles
               further before they rose, and so concluded their first day.  When
               they were risen, Ricciardo and Messer Lizio discussed the matter
               with more formality; and some days afterwards Ricciardo, as was
               meet, married the damsel anew in presence of their friends and
               kinsfolk, and brought her home with great pomp, and celebrated his
               nuptials with due dignity and splendour. And so for many a year
               thereafter he lived with her in peace and happiness, and snared the
               nightingales day and night to his heart's content.

               <p> All the ladies laughed so heartily over the story of the

               <p>As <span class="person">Filostrato</span> went to <span class="place">Romagna</span> for the matter of
                  his discourse, I too am fain to make a short journey through the
                  same country in what I am about to relate to you.
               </p>
            </div>
            <p>I say, then, that there dwelt of yore in the city of <span class="place">Fano</span> two
               Lombards, the one ycleped Guidotto da <span class="place">Cremona</span> and the other
               Giacomino da <span class="place">Pavia</span>, men advanced in life, who, being soldiers, had
               spent the best part of their youth in feats of arms.  Now Guidotto,
               being at the point of death, and having no son or any friend or kinsman
               in whom he placed more trust than in Giacomino, left him a
               girl of about ten years, and all that he had in the world; and so,
               having given him to know not a little of his affairs, he died.  About
               the same time the city of <span class="place">Faenza</span>, which had long been at war and
               in a most sorry plight, began to recover some measure of prosperity;
               and thereupon liberty to return thither on honourable terms was
               accorded to all that were so minded. Whither, accordingly, Giacomino,
               who had dwelt there aforetime, and liked the place, returned
               with all his goods and chattels, taking with him the girl left him by
               Guidotto, whom he loved and entreated as his daughter.  The girl
               grew up as beautiful a maiden as was to be found in the city; and
               no less debonair and modest was she than fair. Wherefore she
               lacked not admirers; but above all two young men, both very gallant
               and of equal merit, the one Giannole di Severino, the other Minghino
               di Mingole, affected her with so ardent a passion, that, growing
               jealous, they came to hate one another with an inordinate hatred.
               Right gladly would each have espoused her, she being now fifteen
               years old, but that his kinsmen forbade it; wherefore seeing that
               neither might have her in an honourable way, each determined to
               compass his end as best he might.
            </p>
            <p>Now Giacomino had in his house an ancient maid, and a man, by
               name <span class="person">Crivello</span>, a very pleasant and friendly sort of fellow, with whom
               Giannole grew familiar, and in due time confided to him all his love,
               praying him to further the attainment of his desire, and promising to
               reward him handsomely, if he did so.  <span class="person">Crivello</span> made answer: Thou
               must know that there is but one way in which I might be of service
               to thee in this affair: I might contrive that thou shouldst be where
               she is when Giacomino is gone off to supper; but, were I to presume
               to say aught to her on thy behalf, she would never listen to me.
               This, if it please thee, I promise to do for thee, and will be as good
               as my word; and then thou canst do whatever thou mayst deem
               most expedient.  Giannole said that he asked no more; and so 'twas
               arranged.
            </p>
            <p>Meanwhile Minghino on his part had made friends with the
               maid, on whom he had so wrought that she had carried several
               messages to the girl, and had gone far to kindle her to his love, and
               furthermore had promised to contrive that he should meet her when
               for any cause Giacomino should be from home in the evening.  And
               so it befell that no long time after these parleys, Giacomino, by
               <span class="person">Crivello</span>'s management, was to go sup at the house of a friend, and
               by preconcert between <span class="person">Crivello</span> and Giannole, upon signal given,
               Giannole was to come to Giacomino's house and find the door open.
               The maid, on her part, witting nought of the understanding between
               <span class="person">Crivello</span> and Giannole, let Minghino know that Giacomino would not
               sup at home, and bade him be near the house, so that he might come
               and enter it on sight of a signal from her.  The evening came; neither
               of the lovers knew aught of what the other was about; but, being
               suspicious of one another, they came to take possession, each with
               his own company of armed friends. Minghino, while awaiting the
               signal, rested with his company in the house of one of his friends
               hard by the girl's house: Giannole with his company was posted a
               little farther off.  <span class="person">Crivello</span> and the maid, when Giacomino was gone,
               did each their endeavour to get the other out of the way. <span class="person">Crivello</span>
               said to the maid: How is it thou takest not thyself off to bed,
               but goest still hither and thither about the house?  And the maid
               said to <span class="person">Crivello</span>: Nay, but why goest thou not after thy master?
               Thou hast supped; what awaitest thou here?  And so, neither
               being able to make the other quit the post, <span class="person">Crivello</span>, the hour
               concerted with Giannole being come, said to himself: What care
               I for her? If she will not keep quiet, 'tis like to be the worse for
               her. Whereupon he gave the signal, and hied him to the door,
               which he had no sooner opened, than Giannole entered with two of
               his companions, and finding the girl in the saloon, laid hands on her
               with intent to carry her off.  The girl struggled, and shrieked amain,
               as did also the maid. Minghino, fearing the noise, hasted to the
               spot with his companions; and, seeing that the girl was already being
               borne across the threshold, they drew their swords, and cried out in
               chorus: Ah! Traitors that ye are, ye are all dead men! 'Twill
               go otherwise than ye think for. What means this force? Which
               said, they fell upon them with their swords,  while the neighbours,
               alarmed by the noise, came hurrying forth with lights and arms, and
               protested that 'twas an outrage, and took Minghino's part. So, after
               a prolonged struggle, Minghino wrested the girl from Giannole, and
               set her again in Giacomino's house. Nor were the combatants
               separated before the officers of the Governor of the city came up
               and arrested not a few of them; among them Minghino and Giannole
               and <span class="person">Crivello</span>, whom they marched off to prison.  However,
               peace being restored and Giacomino returned, 'twas with no little
               chagrin that he heard of the affair; but finding upon investigation
               that the girl was in no wise culpable, he was somewhat reassured;
               and determined, lest the like should again happen, to bestow the girl
               in marriage as soon as might be.
            </p>
            <p>On the morrow the kinsfolk of the two lovers, having learned
               the truth of the matter, and knowing what evil might ensue to the
               captives, if Giacomino should be minded to take the course which
               he reasonably might, came and gave him good words, beseeching him
               to let the kindly feeling, the love, which they believed he bore
               to them, his suppliants, count for more with him than the wrong
               that the hare-brained gallants had done him, and on their part and
               their own offering to make any amend that he might require.
               Giacomino, who had seen many things in his time, and lacked not
               sound sense, made answer briefly: Gentlemen, were I in my own
               country, as I am in yours, I hold myself in such sort your friend
               that nought would I do in this matter, or in any other, save what
               might be agreeable to you:  besides which, I have the more reason
               to consider your wishes, because 'tis against you yourselves that you
               have offended, inasmuch as this damsel, whatever many folk may
               suppose, is neither of <span class="place">Cremona</span> nor of <span class="place">Pavia</span>, but is of <span class="place">Faenza</span>, albeit
               neither I nor she, nor he from whom I had her, did ever wot whose
               daughter she was: wherefore, touching that you ask of me, I will
               even do just as you bid me.  The worthy men found it passing
               strange that the girl should be of <span class="place">Faenza</span>; and having thanked Giacomino
               for his handsome answer, they besought him that he would be
               pleased to tell them how she had come into his hands, and how he
               knew that she was of <span class="place">Faenza</span>.  To whom Giacomino replied on
               this wise: A comrade and friend I had, Guidotto da <span class="place">Cremona</span>,
               who, being at the point of death, told me that, when this city of
               <span class="place">Faenza</span> was taken by the Emperor Frederic, he and his comrades,
               entering one of the houses during the sack, found there good store of
               booty, and never a soul save this girl,  who, being two years old or
               thereabouts, greeted him as father as he came up the stairs; wherefore
               he took pity on her, and carried her with whatever else was in the
               house away with him to <span class="place">Fano</span>; where on his deathbed he left her to
               me, charging me in due time to bestow her in marriage, and give her
               all his goods and chattels by way of dowry:  but, albeit she is now
               of marriageable age, I have not been able to provide her with a
               husband to my mind; though right glad should I be to do so, that
               nought like the event of yesterday may again befall me.
            </p>
            <p>Now among the rest of those present was one Guglielmo da
               Medicina, who had been with Guidotto on that occasion, and knew
               well whose house it was that Guidotto had sacked; and seeing the
               owner there among the rest, he went up to him, and said: Dost
               hear, <span class="person">Bernabuccio</span>, what Giacomino says? Ay, answered
               <span class="person">Bernabuccio</span>,
               and I gave the more heed thereto, for that I call to mind
               that during those disorders I lost a little daughter of just the age that
               Giacomino speaks of. 'Tis verily she then, said Guglielmo,
               for once when I was with Guidotto I heard him describe what house
               it was that he had sacked, and I wist that 'twas thine. Wherefore
               search thy memory if there be any sign by which thou thinkest to
               recognize her, and let her be examined that thou mayst be assured that
               she is thy daughter.  So <span class="person">Bernabuccio</span> pondered a while, and then
               recollected that she ought to have a scar, shewing like a tiny cross,
               above her left ear, being where he had excised a tumour a little while
               before that affair: wherefore without delay he went up to Giacomino,
               who was still there, and besought him to let him go home with
               him and see the damsel.  Giacomino gladly did so, and no sooner was
               the girl brought into <span class="person">Bernabuccio</span>'s presence, than, as he beheld her,
               'twas as if he saw the face of her mother, who was still a beautiful
               woman. However, he would not rest there, but besought Giacomino
               of his grace to permit him to lift a lock or two of hair above her left
               ear; whereto Giacomino consented.  So <span class="person">Bernabuccio</span> approached
               her where she stood somewhat shamefast, and with his right hand
               lifted her locks, and, seeing the cross, wist that in very truth she was
               his daughter, and tenderly wept and embraced her, albeit she withstood
               him;  and then, turning to Giacomino, he said: My
               brother, the girl is my daughter; 'twas my house that Guidotto
               sacked, and so sudden was the assault that my wife, her mother,
               forgot her, and we have always hitherto supposed, that, my house
               being burned that same day, she perished in the flames.  Catching
               his words, and seeing that he was advanced in years, the girl inclined
               to believe him, and impelled by some occult instinct, suffered his
               embraces, and melting, mingled her tears with his.  <span class="person">Bernabuccio</span>
               forthwith sent for her mother and her sisters and other kinswomen
               and her brothers, and having shewn her to them all, and told the
               story, after they had done her great cheer and embraced her a
               thousand times, to Giacomino's no small delight, he brought her
               home with him.  Which coming to the ears of the Governor of the
               city, the worthy man, knowing that Giannole, whom he had in
               ward, was <span class="person">Bernabuccio</span>'s son and the girl's brother, made up his
               mind to deal leniently with Giannole: wherefore he took upon
               himself the part of mediator in the affair, and having made peace
               between <span class="person">Bernabuccio</span> and Giacomino and Giannole and Minghino,
               gave <span class="person">Agnesa</span>--such was the damsel's name--to Minghino to wife, to
               the great delight of all Minghino's kinsfolk, and set at liberty not
               only Giannole and Minghino but <span class="person">Crivello</span>, and the others their
               confederates in the affair.  Whereupon Minghino with the blithest
               of hearts wedded <span class="person">Agnesa</span> with all due pomp and circumstance, and
               brought her home, where for many a year thereafter he lived with
               her in peace and prosperity.

            </div>
            <p>Hard by <span class="place">Naples</span> is the island of <span class="place">Ischia</span>, in which there dwelt
               aforetime with other young damsels one, Restituta by name, daughter
               of one Marin Bolgaro, a gentleman of the island. Very fair was
               she, and blithe of heart, and by a young gallant, Gianni by name,
               of the neighbouring islet of <span class="place">Procida</span>, was beloved more dearly than
               life, and in like measure returned his love.  Now, not to mention his
               daily resort to <span class="place">Ischia</span> to see her, there were times not a few when
               Gianni, not being able to come by a boat, would swim across from
               <span class="place">Procida</span> by night, that he might have sight, if of nought else, at
               least of the walls of her house.  And while their love burned thus
               fervently, it so befell that one summer's day, as the damsel was all
               alone on the seashore, picking her way from rock to rock, detaching,
               as she went, shells from their beds with a knife, she came to a recess
               among the rocks, where for the sake, as well of the shade as of the
               comfort afforded by a spring of most cool water that was there,
               some Sicilian gallants, that were come from <span class="place">Naples</span>, had put in with
               their felucca.  Who, having taken note of the damsel, that she was
               very fair, and that she was not yet ware of them, and was alone,
               resolved to capture her, and carry her away; nor did they fail to
               give effect to their resolve;  but, albeit she shrieked amain, they laid
               hands on her, and set her aboard their boat, and put to sea. Arrived
               at <span class="place">Calabria</span>, they fell a wrangling as to whose the damsel should be,
               and in brief each claimed her for his own: wherefore, finding no
               means of coming to an agreement, and fearing that worse might
               befall them, and she bring misfortune upon them, they resolved with
               one accord to give her to Frederic, King of <span class="place">Sicily</span>, who was then a
               young man, and took no small delight in commodities of that
               quality; and so, being come to <span class="place">Palermo</span>, they did.
            </p>
            <p>Marking her beauty, the King set great store by her; but as she
               was somewhat indisposed, he commanded that, till she was stronger,
               she should be lodged and tended in a very pretty villa that was in
               one of his gardens, which he called <span class="place">Cuba</span>; and so 'twas done.  The
               purloining of the damsel caused no small stir in <span class="place">Ischia</span>, more especially
               because 'twas impossible to discover by whom she had been
               carried off.  But Gianni, more concerned than any other, despairing
               of finding her in <span class="place">Ischia</span>, and being apprised of the course the felucca
               had taken, equipped one himself, and put to sea, and in hot haste
               scoured the whole coast from <span class="place">Minerva</span> to <span class="place">Scalea in Calabria</span>, making
               everywhere diligent search for the damsel, and in <span class="place">Scalea</span> learned
               that she had been taken by Sicilian mariners to <span class="place">Palermo</span>.  Whither,
               accordingly, he hied him with all speed; and there after long search
               discovering that she had been given to the King, who kept her at
               <span class="place">Cuba</span>, he was sore troubled, insomuch that he now scarce ventured
               to hope that he should ever set eyes on her, not to speak of having
               her for his own, again.  But still, holden by Love, and seeing that
               none there knew him, he sent the felucca away, and tarried there,
               and frequently passing by <span class="place">Cuba</span>, he chanced one day to catch sight
               of her at a window, and was seen of her, to their great mutual
               satisfaction.  And Gianni, taking note that the place was lonely,
               made up to her, and had such speech of her as he might, and being
               taught by her after what fashion he must proceed, if he would have
               further speech of her, he departed, but not till he had made himself
               thoroughly acquainted with the configuration of the place;  and
               having waited until night was come and indeed far spent, he returned
               thither, and though the ascent was such that 'twould scarce have
               afforded lodgment to a woodpecker, won his way up and entered the
               garden, where, finding a pole, he set it against the window which
               the damsel had pointed out as hers, and thereby swarmed up easily
               enough.
            </p>
            <p>The damsel had aforetime shewn herself somewhat distant
               towards him, being careful of her honour, but now deeming it
               already lost, she had bethought her that there was none to whom
               she might more worthily give herself than to him; and reckoning
               upon inducing him to carry her off, she had made up her mind to
               gratify his every desire; and to that end had left the window open
               that his ingress might be unimpeded.  So, finding it open, Gianni
               softly entered, lay down beside the damsel, who was awake,  and
               before they went further, opened to him all her mind, beseeching
               him most earnestly to take her thence, and carry her off. Gianni
               replied that there was nought that would give him so much pleasure,
               and that without fail, upon leaving her, he would make all needful
               arrangements for bringing her away when he next came.  Whereupon
               with exceeding great delight they embraced one another, and
               plucked that boon than which Love has no greater to bestow; and
               having so done divers times, they unwittingly fell asleep in one
               another's arms.
            </p>
            <p>Now towards daybreak the King, who had been greatly charmed
               with the damsel at first sight, happened to call her to mind, and
               feeling himself fit, resolved, notwithstanding the hour, to go lie with
               her a while;  and so, attended by a few of his servants, he hied him
               privily to <span class="place">Cuba</span>. Having entered the house, he passed (the door
               being softly opened) into the room in which he knew the damsel
               slept. A great blazing torch was borne before him, and so, as he
               bent his glance on the bed, he espied the damsel and Gianni lying
               asleep, naked and in one another's arms.  Whereat he was seized
               with a sudden and vehement passion of wrath, insomuch that, albeit
               he said never a word, he could scarce refrain from slaying both of
               them there and then with a dagger that he had with him.  Then,
               bethinking him that 'twere the depth of baseness in any man--not
               to say a king--to slay two naked sleepers, he mastered himself, and
               determined to do them to death in public and by fire. Wherefore,
               turning to a single companion that he had with him, he said:
               What thinkest thou of this base woman, in whom I had placed
               my hope? And then he asked whether he knew the gallant, that
               had presumed to enter his house to do him such outrage and despite.
               Whereto the other replied that he minded not ever to have seen
               him.  Thereupon the King hied him out of the room in a rage,
               and bade take the two lovers, naked as they were, and bind them,
               and, as soon as 'twas broad day, bring them to <span class="place">Palermo</span>, and bind
               them back to back to a stake in the piazza, there to remain until
               tierce, that all might see them, after which they were to be burned,
               as they had deserved. And having so ordered, he went back to
               <span class="place">Palermo</span>, and shut himself up in his room, very wroth.
            </p>
            <p>No sooner was he gone than there came unto the two lovers folk
               not a few, who, having awakened them, did forthwith ruthlessly take
               and bind them: whereat, how they did grieve and tremble for
               their lives, and weep and bitterly bewail their fate, may readily be
               understood.
            </p>
            <p>Pursuant to the King's commandment they were brought to
               <span class="place">Palermo</span>, and bound to a stake in the piazza; and before their eyes
               faggots and fire were made ready to burn them at the hour appointed
               by the King.  Great was the concourse of the folk of <span class="place">Palermo</span>, both
               men and women, that came to see the two lovers, the men all agog
               to feast their eyes on the damsel, whom they lauded for shapeliness
               and loveliness, and no less did the women commend the gallant,
               whom in like manner they crowded to see, for the same qualities.
               Meanwhile the two hapless lovers, both exceeding shamefast, stood
               with bent heads bitterly bewailing their evil fortune, and momently
               expecting their death by the cruel fire.  So they awaited the time
               appointed by the King; but their offence being bruited abroad, the
               tidings reached the ears of Ruggieri dell' Oria, a man of peerless
               worth, and at that time the King's admiral, who, being likewise
               minded to see them, came to the place where they were bound, and
               after gazing on the damsel and finding her very fair, turned to look
               at the gallant, whom with little trouble he recognized, and drawing
               nearer to him, he asked him if he were Gianni di <span class="place">Procida</span>.  Gianni
               raised his head, and recognizing the admiral, made answer: My
               lord, he, of whom you speak, I was; but I am now as good as no
               more.  The admiral then asked him what it was that had brought
               him to such a pass. Whereupon: Love and the King's wrath,
               quoth Gianni.  The admiral induced him to be more explicit, and
               having learned from him exactly how it had come about, was turning
               away, when Gianni called him back, saying: Oh! my lord, if so
               it may be, procure me one favour of him by whose behest I thus
               stand here. What favour? demanded Ruggieri. I see,
               returned Gianni, that die I must, and that right soon. I crave,
               then, as a favour, that, whereas this damsel and I, that have loved one
               another more dearly than life, are here set back to back, we may be
               set face to face, that I may have the consolation of gazing on her
               face as I depart.  Ruggieri laughed as he replied: With all my
               heart. I will so order it that thou shalt see enough of her to tire or
               her.  He then left him and charged the executioners to do nothing
               more without further order of the King; and being assured of their
               obedience, he hied him forthwith to the King, to whom, albeit he
               found him in a wrathful mood, he spared not to speak his mind,
               saying: Sire, wherein have they wronged thee, those two young
               folk, whom thou hast ordered to be burned down there in the
               piazza?  The King told him. Whereupon Ruggieri continued:
               Their offence does indeed merit such punishment, but not at thy
               hands, and if misdeeds should not go unpunished, services should not
               go unrewarded; nay, may warrant indulgence and mercy. Knowest
               thou who they are whom thou wouldst have burned?  The King
               signified that he did not. Whereupon Ruggieri: But I, quoth
               he, am minded that thou shouldst know them, to the end that thou
               mayst know with what discretion thou surrenderest thyself to a
               transport of rage.  The young man is the son of Landolfo di
               <span class="place">Procida</span>, brother of Messer Gianni di <span class="place">Procida</span>, to whom thou owest
               it that thou art lord and king of this island. The damsel is a
               daughter of Marin Bolgaro, whose might alone to-day prevents
               <span class="place">Ischia</span> from throwing off thy yoke.  Moreover, these young folk
               have long been lovers, and 'tis for that the might of Love constrained
               them, and not that they would do despite to thy lordship, that they
               have committed this offence, if indeed 'tis meet to call that an
               offence which young folk do for Love's sake. Wherefore, then,
               wouldst thou do them to death, when thou shouldst rather do them
               all cheer, and honour them with lordly gifts?  The King gave ear
               to Ruggieri's words, and being satisfied that he spoke sooth, repented
               him, not only of his evil purpose, but of what he had already done,
               and forthwith gave order to loose the two young folk from the
               stake, and bring them before him; and so 'twas done.  And having
               fully apprised himself of their case, he saw fit to make them amends
               of the wrong he had done them with honours and largess. Wherefore
               he caused them to be splendidly arrayed, and being assured that
               they were both minded to wed, he himself gave Gianni his bride,
               and loading them with rich presents, sent them well content back to
               <span class="place">Ischia</span>, where they were welcomed with all festal cheer, and lived
               long time thereafter to their mutual solace and delight.

            <div class="frame">
               <p> While they doubted whether the two lovers would be burned,
                  the ladies were all fear and suspense; but when they heard of their
                  deliverance, they all with one accord put on a cheerful countenance,
                  praising God. The story ended, the queen ordained that the next
                  should be told by <span class="person">Lauretta</span>, who blithely thus began:
               </p>
            </div>
            <p>Fairest ladies, what time good King Guglielmo ruled <span class="place">Sicily</span> there
               dwelt on the island a gentleman, Messer Amerigo Abate da <span class="place">Trapani</span>
               by name, who was well provided, as with other temporal goods, so
               also with children.  For which cause being in need of servants, he
               took occasion of the appearance in <span class="place">Trapani</span> waters of certain Genoese
               corsairs from the Levant, who, scouring the coast of <span class="place">Armenia</span>,
               had captured not a few boys, to purchase of them some of these
               youngsters, supposing them to be Turks; among whom, albeit most
               shewed as mere shepherd boys, there was one, Teodoro by name,
               whose less rustic mien seemed to betoken gentle blood.  Who,
               though still treated as a slave, was suffered to grow up in the house
               with Messer Amerigo's children, and, nature getting the better of
               circumstance, bore himself with such grace and dignity that Messer
               Amerigo gladly gave him his freedom, and still deeming him to be
               a Turk, had him baptized and named Pietro, and made him his major-domo,
               and placed much trust in him.  Now among the other
               children that grew up in Messer Amerigo's house was his fair and
               dainty daughter, Violante; and, as her father was in no hurry to give
               her in marriage, it so befell that she became enamoured of Pietro;
               but, for all her love and the great conceit she had of his qualities
               and conduct, she nevertheless was too shamefast to discover her
               passion to him.  However, Love spared her the pains, for Pietro had
               cast many a furtive glance in her direction, and had grown so
               enamoured of her that 'twas never well with him except he saw her;
               but great was his fear lest any should detect his passion, for he
               deemed 'twould be the worse for him. The damsel, who was fain
               indeed of the sight of him, understood his case; and to encourage
               him dissembled not her exceeding great satisfaction.  On which
               footing they remained a great while, neither venturing to say aught
               to the other, much as both longed to do so.  But, while they both
               burned with a mutual flame, Fortune, as if their entanglement
               were of her preordaining, found means to banish the fear and
               hesitation that kept them tongue-tied.
            </p>
            <p>Messer Amerigo possessed, a mile or so from <span class="place">Trapani</span>, a goodly
               estate, to which he was wont not seldom to resort with his daughter
               and other ladies by way of recreation;  and on one of these days,
               while there they tarried with Pietro, whom they had brought with
               them, suddenly, as will sometimes happen in summer, the sky became
               overcast with black clouds, insomuch that the lady and her companions,
               lest the storm should surprise them there, set out on their return
               to <span class="place">Trapani</span>, making all the haste they might.  But Pietro and the
               girl being young, and sped perchance by Love no less than by fear of
               the storm, completely outstripped her mother and the other ladies;
               and when they were gotten so far ahead as to be well-nigh out of
               sight of the lady and all the rest, the thunder burst upon them peal
               upon peal, hard upon which came a fall of hail very thick and close,
               from which the lady sought shelter in the house of a husbandman.
               Pietro and the damsel, finding no more convenient refuge, betook
               them to an old, and all but ruinous, and now deserted, cottage, which,
               however, still had a bit of roof left, whereunder they both took their
               stand in such close quarters, owing to the exiguity of the shelter, that
               they perforce touched one another. Which contact was the occasion
               that they gathered somewhat more courage to disclose their love;
               and so it was that Pietro began on this wise: Now would to God
               that this hail might never cease, that so I might stay here for ever!
               And well content were I, returned the damsel. 
               And by and by
               their hands met, not without a tender pressure, and then they fell to
               embracing and so to kissing one another, while the hail continued.
               And not to dwell on every detail, the sky was not clear before they
               had known the last degree of love's felicity, and had taken thought
               how they might secretly enjoy one another in the future.  The
               cottage being close to the city gate, they hied them thither, as soon
               as the storm was overpast, and having there awaited the lady, returned
               home with her. Nor, using all discretion, did they fail thereafter to
               meet from time to time in secret, to their no small solace; and the
               affair went so far that the damsel conceived, whereby they were both
               not a little disconcerted; insomuch that the damsel employed many
               artifices to arrest the course of nature, but to no effect.  Wherefore
               Pietro, being in fear of his life, saw nothing for it but flight, and told
               her so. Whereupon: If thou leave me, quoth she, I shall
               certainly kill myself.  Much as he loved her, Pietro answered:
               Nay but, my lady, wherefore wouldst thou have me tarry here?
               Thy pregnancy will discover our offence: thou wilt be readily
               forgiven; but 'twill be my woeful lot to bear the penalty of thy sin
               and mine. Pietro, returned the damsel, too well will they wot
               of my offence, but be sure that, if thou confess not, none will ever
               wot of thine.  Then quoth he: Since thou givest me this
               promise, I will stay; but mind thou keep it.
            </p>
            <p>The damsel, who had done her best to keep her condition secret,
               saw at length by the increase of her bulk that 'twas impossible:
               wherefore one day most piteously bewailing herself, she made her
               avowal to her mother, and besought her to shield her from the
               consequences.  Distressed beyond measure, the lady chid her severely,
               and then asked her how it had come to pass. The damsel, to screen
               Pietro, invented a story by which she put another complexion on the
               affair. The lady believed her, and, that her fall might not be
               discovered, took her off to one of their estates;  where, the time of her
               delivery being come, and she, as women do in such a case, crying out
               for pain, it so befell that Messer Amerigo, whom the lady expected
               not, as indeed he was scarce ever wont, to come there, did so, having
               been out a hawking, and passing by the chamber where the damsel
               lay, marvelled to hear her cries, and forthwith entered, and asked what
               it meant.  On sight of whom the lady rose and sorrowfully gave him
               her daughter's version of what had befallen her. But he, less credulous
               than his wife, averred that it could not be true that she knew
               not by whom she was pregnant, and was minded to know the whole
               truth: let the damsel confess and she might regain his favour;
               otherwise she must expect no mercy and prepare for death.
            </p>
            <p>The lady did all she could to induce her husband to rest satisfied
               with what she had told him; but all to no purpose.  Mad with rage,
               he rushed, drawn sword in hand, to his daughter's bedside (she, pending
               the parley, having given birth to a boy) and cried out: Declare
               whose this infant is, or forthwith thou diest.  Overcome by fear of
               death, the damsel broke her promise to Pietro, and made a clean
               breast of all that had passed between him and her. Whereat the
               knight, grown fell with rage, could scarce refrain from slaying her.
               However, having given vent to his wrath in such words as it
               dictated, he remounted his horse and rode to <span class="place">Trapani</span>, and there
               before one Messer <span class="person">Currado</span>, the King's lieutenant, laid information of
               the wrong done him by Pietro, in consequence whereof Pietro, who
               suspected nothing, was forthwith taken, and being put to the torture,
               confessed all.  Some days later the lieutenant sentenced him to be
               scourged through the city, and then hanged by the neck; and Messer
               Amerigo, being minded that one and the same hour should rid the
               earth of the two lovers and their son (for to have compassed Pietro's
               death was not enough to appease his wrath), mingled poison and wine
               in a goblet, and gave it to one of his servants with a drawn sword,
               saying: Get thee with this gear to Violante, and tell her from me
               to make instant choice of one of these two deaths, either the poison
               or the steel; else, I will have her burned, as she deserves, in view of
               all the citizens; which done, thou wilt take the boy that she bore a
               few days ago, and beat his brains out against the wall, and cast his
               body for a prey to the dogs.
            </p>
            <p>Hearing the remorseless doom thus passed by the angry father
               upon both his daughter and his grandson, the servant, prompt to do
               evil rather than good, hied him thence.
            </p>
            <p>Now, as Pietro in execution of his sentence was being scourged to
               the gallows by the serjeants, 'twas so ordered by the leaders of the band
               that he passed by an inn, where were three noblemen of <span class="place">Armenia</span>,
               sent by the king of that country as ambassadors to <span class="place">Rome</span>, to treat
               with the Pope of matters of the highest importance, touching a
               crusade that was to be; who, having there alighted to rest and recreate
               them for some days, had received not a few tokens of honour
               from the nobles of <span class="place">Trapani</span>, and most of all from Messer Amerigo.
               Hearing the tramp of Pietro's escort, they came to a window to see
               what was toward;  and one of them, an aged man, and of great
               authority, <span class="person">Fineo</span> by name, looking hard at Pietro, who was stripped
               from the waist up, and had his hands bound behind his back, espied
               on his breast a great spot of scarlet, not laid on by art, but wrought
               in the skin by operation of Nature, being such as the ladies here call
               a rose.  Which he no sooner saw, than he was reminded of a son
               that had been stolen from him by corsairs on the coast of Lazistan
               some fifteen years before, nor had he since been able to hear tidings
               of him;  and guessing the age of the poor wretch that was being
               scourged, he set it down as about what his son's would be, were
               he living, and, what with the mark and the age, he began to
               suspect that 'twas even his son, and bethought him that, if so, he
               would scarce as yet have forgotten his name or the speech of <span class="place">Armenia</span>.
               Wherefore, as he was within earshot he called to him: Teodoro!
               At the word Pietro raised his head: whereupon <span class="person">Fineo</span>,
               speaking in <span class="place">Armenia</span>n, asked him: Whence and whose son art
               thou?  The serjeants, that were leading him, paused in deference
               to the great man, and so Pietro answered: Of <span class="place">Armenia</span> was I,
               son of one <span class="person">Fineo</span>, brought hither by folk I wot not of, when I was
               but a little child.  Then <span class="person">Fineo</span>, witting that in very truth 'twas
               the boy that he had lost, came down with his companions, weeping;
               and, all the serjeants making way, he ran to him, and embraced him,
               and doffing a mantle of richest texture that he wore, he prayed the
               captain of the band to be pleased to tarry there until he should receive
               orders to go forward, and was answered by the captain that he would
               willingly so wait.
            </p>
            <p><span class="person">Fineo</span> already knew, for 'twas bruited everywhere, the cause for
               which Pietro was being led to the gallows; wherefore he straightway
               hied him with his companions and their retinue to Messer <span class="person">Currado</span>,
               and said to him: Sir, this lad, whom you are sending to the
               gallows like a slave, is freeborn, and my son, and is ready to take to
               wife her whom, as 'tis said, he has deflowered; so please you, therefore,
               delay the execution until such time as it may be understood whether
               she be minded to have him for husband, lest, should she be so minded,
               you be found to have broken the law.  Messer <span class="person">Currado</span> marvelled
               to hear that Pietro was <span class="person">Fineo</span>'s son, and not without shame, albeit
               'twas not his but Fortune's fault, confessed that 'twas even as <span class="person">Fineo</span>
               said: and having caused Pietro to be taken home with all speed, and
               Messer Amerigo to be brought before him, told him the whole
               matter.  Messer Amerigo, who supposed that by this time his
               daughter and grandson must be dead, was the saddest man in the world
               to think that 'twas by his deed, witting that, were the damsel still alive,
               all might very easily be set right: however, he sent post haste to his
               daughter's abode, revoking his orders, if they were not yet carried
               out.  The servant, whom he had earlier despatched, had laid the
               sword and poison before the damsel, and, for that she was in no hurry
               to make her choice, was giving her foul words, and endeavouring to
               constrain her thereto, when the messenger arrived; but on hearing
               the injunction laid upon him by his lord, he desisted, and went back,
               and told him how things stood.  Whereupon Messer Amerigo, much
               relieved, hied him to <span class="person">Fineo</span>, and well-nigh weeping, and excusing
               himself for what had befallen, as best he knew how, craved his
               pardon, and professed himself well content to give Teodoro, so he
               were minded to have her, his daughter to wife.  <span class="person">Fineo</span> readily
               accepted his excuses, and made answer: 'Tis my will that my son
               espouse your daughter, and, so he will not, let thy sentence passed
               upon him be carried out.
            </p>
            <p>So <span class="person">Fineo</span> and Messer Amerigo being agreed, while Teodoro still
               languished in fear of death, albeit he was glad at heart to have found
               his father, they questioned him of his will in regard of this matter.
            </p>
            <p>When he heard that, if he would, he might have Violante to
               wife, Teodoro's delight was such that he seemed to leap from hell
               to paradise, and said that, if 'twas agreeable to them all, he should
               deem it the greatest of favours.  So they sent to the damsel to learn
               her pleasure: who, having heard how it had fared, and was now like
               to fare, with Teodoro, albeit, saddest of women, she looked for
               nought but death, began at length to give some credence to their
               words, and to recover heart a little, and answered that, were she to
               follow the bent of her desire, nought that could happen would delight
               her more than to be Teodoro's wife; but nevertheless she would do
               as her father bade her.
            </p>
            <p>So, all agreeing, the damsel was espoused with all pomp and festal
               cheer, to the boundless delight of all the citizens, 
               and was comforted,
               and nurtured her little boy, and in no long time waxed more beautiful
               than ever before; and, her confinement being ended, she presented
               herself before <span class="person">Fineo</span>, who was then about to quit <span class="place">Rome</span> on his
               homeward journey, and did him such reverence as is due to a father.
               <span class="person">Fineo</span>, mighty well pleased to have so fair a daughter-in-law, caused
               celebrate her nuptials most bravely and gaily, and received, and did
               ever thereafter entreat, her as his daughter.
            </p>
            <p>And so he took her, not many days after the festivities were
               ended, with his son and little grandson, aboard a galley, and brought
               them to Lazistan, and there thenceforth the two lovers dwelt with
               him in easeful and lifelong peace.

            </div>
            <p>In <span class="place">Ravenna</span>, that most ancient city of <span class="place">Romagna</span>, there dwelt of yore
               noblemen and gentlemen not a few, among whom was a young man,
               Nastagio degli Onesti by name, who by the death of his father and one
               of his uncles inherited immense wealth.  Being without a wife, Nastagio,
               as 'tis the way with young men, became enamoured of a daughter
               of Messer Paolo Traversaro, a damsel of much higher birth than his,
               whose love he hoped to win by gifts and the like modes of courting,
               which,  albeit they were excellent and fair and commendable, not
               only availed him not, but seemed rather to have the contrary effect,
               so harsh and ruthless and unrelenting did the beloved damsel shew
               herself towards him; for whether it was her uncommon beauty or
               her noble lineage that puffed her up, so haughty and disdainful was
               she grown that pleasure she had none either in him or in aught that
               pleased him.  The burden of which disdain Nastagio found so hard
               to bear, that many a time, when he had made his moan, he longed to
               make away with himself. However he refrained therefrom, and
               many a time resolved to give her up altogether, or, if so he might, to
               hold her in despite, as she did him:  but 'twas all in vain, for it
               seemed as if, the more his hope dwindled, the greater grew his love.
               And, as thus he continued, loving and spending inordinately, certain
               of his kinsfolk and friends, being apprehensive lest he should waste
               both himself and his substance, did many a time counsel and beseech
               him to depart <span class="place">Ravenna</span>, and go tarry for a time elsewhere, that so he
               might at once cool his flame and reduce his charges.  For a long
               while Nastagio answered their admonitions with banter; but as they
               continued to ply him with them, he grew weary of saying no so
               often, and promised obedience. Whereupon he equipped himself as
               if for a journey to <span class="place">France</span> or <span class="place">Spain</span>, or other distant parts, got on
               horseback and sallied forth of <span class="place">Ravenna</span>, accompanied by not a few of
               his friends, and being come to a place called <span class="place">Chiassi</span>, about three
               miles from <span class="place">Ravenna</span>,  he halted, and having sent for tents and pavilions,
               told his companions that there he meant to stay, and they might go
               back to <span class="place">Ravenna</span>.  So Nastagio pitched his camp, and there commenced
               to live after as fine and lordly a fashion as did ever any man,
               bidding divers of his friends from time to time to breakfast or sup
               with him, as he had been wont to do.  Now it so befell that about
               the beginning of May, the season being very fine, he fell a brooding
               on the cruelty of his mistress, and, that his meditations might be the
               less disturbed, he bade all his servants leave him, and sauntered slowly,
               wrapt in thought, as far as the pinewood.  Which he had threaded
               for a good half-mile, when, the fifth hour of the day being well-nigh
               past, yet he recking neither of food nor of aught else, 'twas as if he
               heard a woman wailing exceedingly and uttering most piercing
               shrieks: whereat, the train of his sweet melancholy being broken,
               he raised his head to see what was toward, and wondered to find himself
               in the pinewood;  and saw, moreover, before him running through
               a grove, close set with underwood and brambles, towards the place
               where he was, a damsel most comely, stark naked, her hair dishevelled,
               and her flesh all torn by the briers and brambles, who wept and cried
               piteously for mercy;  and at her flanks he saw two mastiffs, exceeding
               great and fierce, that ran hard upon her track, and not seldom
               came up with her and bit her cruelly; and in the rear he saw, riding
               a black horse, a knight sadly accoutred, and very wrathful of mien,
               carrying a rapier in his hand, and with despiteful, blood-curdling
               words threatening her with death.  Whereat he was at once amazed
               and appalled, and then filled with compassion for the hapless lady,
               whereof was bred a desire to deliver her, if so he might, from such
               anguish and peril of death.  Wherefore, as he was unarmed, he ran
               and took in lieu of a cudgel a branch of a tree, with which he prepared
               to encounter the dogs and the knight.  Which the knight observing,
               called to him before he was come to close quarters, saying: Hold
               off, Nastagio, leave the dogs and me alone to deal with this vile
               woman as she has deserved.  And, even as he spoke, the dogs
               gripped the damsel so hard on either flank that they arrested her flight,
               and the knight, being come up, dismounted. Whom Nastagio
               approached, saying: I know not who thou art, that knowest me
               so well, but thus much I tell thee: 'tis a gross outrage for an armed
               knight to go about to kill a naked woman, and set his dogs upon her
               as if she were a wild beast: rest assured that I shall do all I can to
               protect her.  Whereupon: Nastagio, replied the knight, of
               the same city as thou was I, and thou wast yet a little lad when I,
               Messer Guido degli Anastagi by name, being far more enamoured of
               this damsel than thou art now of her of the Traversari, was by her
               haughtiness and cruelty brought to so woeful a pass that one day
               in a fit of despair I slew myself with this rapier which thou seest
               in my hand; for which cause I am condemned to the eternal
               pains.  Nor was it long after my death that she, who exulted
               therein over measure, also died, and for that she repented her
               not of her cruelty and the joy she had of my sufferings, for
               which she took not blame to herself, but merit, was likewise
               condemned to the pains of hell.  Nor had she sooner made her
               descent, than for her pain and mine 'twas ordained, that she should
               flee before me, and that I, who so loved her, should pursue her, not as
               my beloved lady, but as my mortal enemy,  and so, as often as I come
               up with her, I slay her with this same rapier with which I slew
               myself, and having ripped her up by the back, I take out that hard
               and cold heart, to which neither love nor pity had ever access, and
               therewith her other inward parts, as thou shalt forthwith see, and
               cast them to these dogs to eat.  And in no long time, as the just
               and mighty God decrees, she rises even as if she had not died, and
               recommences her dolorous flight, I and the dogs pursuing her.  And
               it so falls out that every Friday about this hour I here come up with
               her, and slaughter her as thou shalt see; but ween not that we rest
               on other days; for there are other places in which I overtake her,
               places in which she used, or devised how she might use, me cruelly;
               on which wise, changed as thou seest from her lover into her foe, I
               am to pursue her for years as many as the months during which she
               shewed herself harsh to me.  Wherefore leave me to execute the
               decree of the Divine justice, and presume not to oppose that which
               thou mayst not avail to withstand.
            </p>
            <p>Affrighted by the knight's words, insomuch that there was scarce
               a hair on his head but stood on end, Nastagio shrank back, still gazing
               on the hapless damsel, and waited all a tremble to see what the knight
               would do.  Nor had he long to wait; for the knight, as soon as he
               had done speaking, sprang, rapier in hand, like a mad dog upon the
               damsel, who, kneeling, while the two mastiffs gripped her tightly,
               cried him mercy; but the knight, thrusting with all his force, struck
               her between the breasts, and ran her clean through the body.  Thus
               stricken, the damsel fell forthwith prone on the ground sobbing and
               shrieking: whereupon the knight drew forth a knife, and having
               therewith opened her in the back, took out the heart and all the
               circumjacent parts, and threw them to the two mastiffs, who, being
               famished, forthwith devoured them. And in no long time the
               damsel, as if nought thereof had happened, started to her feet, and
               took to flight towards the sea, pursued, and ever and anon bitten, by
               the dogs, while the knight, having gotten him to horse again, followed
               them as before, rapier in hand; and so fast sped they that they were
               quickly lost to Nastagio's sight.
            </p>
            <p>Long time he stood musing on what he had seen, divided between
               pity and terror, and then it occurred to him that, as this passed
               every Friday, it might avail him not a little. So, having marked the
               place, he rejoined his servants, and in due time thereafter sent for
               some of his kinsfolk and friends, and said to them: 'Tis now a
               long while that you urge me to give up loving this lady that is no
               friend to me, and therewith make an end of my extravagant way of
               living; and I am now ready so to do, provided you procure me one
               favour, to wit, that next Friday Messer Paolo Traversaro, and his
               wife and daughter, and all the ladies, their kinswomen, and as many
               other ladies as you may be pleased to bid, come hither to breakfast
               with me:  when you will see for yourselves the reason why I so
               desire.  A small matter this seemed to them; and so, on their
               return to <span class="place">Ravenna</span>, they lost no time in conveying Nastagio's message
               to his intended guests: and, albeit she was hardly persuaded, yet in
               the end the damsel that Nastagio loved came with the rest.
            </p>
            <p>Nastagio caused a lordly breakfast to be prepared, and had the
               tables set under the pines about the place where he had witnessed
               the slaughter of the cruel lady; and in ranging the ladies and
               gentlemen at table he so ordered it, that the damsel whom he loved
               was placed opposite the spot where it should be enacted.  The last
               course was just served, when the despairing cries of the hunted
               damsel became audible to all, to their no small amazement; and
               each asking, and none knowing, what it might import, up they all
               started intent to see what was toward; and perceived the suffering
               damsel, and the knight and the dogs, who in a trice were in their
               midst.  They hollaed amain to dogs and knight, and not a few
               advanced to succour the damsel: but the words of the knight, which
               were such as he had used to Nastagio, caused them to fall back,
               terror-stricken and lost in amazement.  And when the knight proceeded
               to do as he had done before, all the ladies that were there,
               many of whom were of kin to the suffering damsel and to the knight,
               and called to mind his love and death, wept as bitterly as if 'twere
               their own case.
            </p>
            <p>When 'twas all over, and the lady and the knight had disappeared,
               the strange scene set those that witnessed it pondering many and
               divers matters: but among them all none was so appalled as the
               cruel damsel that Nastagio loved, who, having clearly seen and heard
               all that had passed, and being ware that it touched her more nearly
               than any other by reason of the harshness that she had ever shewn to
               Nastagio, seemed already to be fleeing from her angered lover, and
               to have the mastiffs on her flanks.  And so great was her terror that,
               lest a like fate should befall her, she converted her aversion into
               affection, and as soon as occasion served, which was that very night,
               sent a trusty chambermaid privily to Nastagio with a request that he
               would be pleased to come to her, for that she was ready in all respects
               to pleasure him to the full.  Nastagio made answer that he was
               greatly flattered, but that he was minded with her consent to have
               his pleasure of her in an honourable way, to wit, by marrying her.
               The damsel, who knew that none but herself was to blame that she
               was not already Nastagio's wife, made answer that she consented.
               Wherefore by her own mouth she acquainted her father and mother
               that she agreed to marry Nastagio; and, they heartily approving her
               choice,  Nastagio wedded her on the ensuing Sunday, and lived
               happily with her many a year. Nor was it in her instance alone that
               this terror was productive of good: on the contrary, it so wrought
               among the ladies of <span class="place">Ravenna</span> that they all became, and have ever
               since been, much more compliant with men's desires than they had
               been wont to be.

            <p> Federigo degli Alberighi loves and is not loved in return:
               he wastes his substance by lavishness until nought is
               left but a single falcon, which, his lady being come to
               see him at his house, he gives her to eat: she, knowing

            <p>'Tis now for me to take up my parable;
               which, dearest ladies, I will do with a story like in some degree to
               the foregoing, and that, not only that you may know how potent are
               your charms to sway the gentle heart, but that you may also learn
               how upon fitting occasions to make bestowal of your guerdons of
               your own accord, instead of always waiting for the guidance of
               Fortune, which most times, not wisely, but without rule or measure,
               scatters her gifts.
            </p>
            <p>You are then to know, that Coppo di Borghese Domenichi, a
               man that in our day was, and perchance still is, had in respect and
               great reverence in our city, being not only by reason of his noble
               lineage, but, and yet more, for manners and merit most illustrious and
               worthy of eternal renown, was in his old age not seldom wont to
               amuse himself by discoursing of things past with his neighbours and
               other folk; wherein he had not his match for accuracy and compass
               of memory and concinnity of speech.  Among other good stories, he
               would tell, how that there was of yore in <span class="place">Florence</span> a gallant named
               Federigo di Messer <span class="person">Filippo</span> Alberighi, who for feats of arms and
               courtesy had not his peer in <span class="place">Tuscany</span>;  who, as is the common lot of
               gentlemen, became enamoured of a lady named Monna Giovanna,
               who in her day held rank among the fairest and most elegant ladies
               of <span class="place">Florence</span>; to gain whose love he jousted, tilted, gave entertainments,
               scattered largess, and in short set no bounds to his expenditure.
               However the lady, no less virtuous than fair, cared not
               a jot for what he did for her sake, nor yet for him.
            </p>
            <p>Spending thus greatly beyond his means, and making nothing,
               Federigo could hardly fail to come to lack, and was at length reduced
               to such poverty that he had nothing left but a little estate, on the
               rents of which he lived very straitly, and a single falcon, the best in
               the world.  The estate was at <span class="place">Campi</span>, and thither, deeming it no
               longer possible for him to live in the city as he desired, he repaired,
               more in love than ever before; and there, in complete seclusion,
               diverting himself with hawking, he bore his poverty as patiently as he
               might.
            </p>
            <p>Now, Federigo being thus reduced to extreme poverty, it so
               happened that one day Monna Giovanna's husband, who was very
               rich, fell ill, and, seeing that he was nearing his end, made his will,
               whereby he left his estate to his son, who was now growing up, and
               in the event of his death without lawful heir named Monna Giovanna,
               whom he dearly loved, heir in his stead; and having made these
               dispositions he died.
            </p>
            <p>Monna Giovanna, being thus left a widow, did as our ladies are
               wont, and repaired in the summer to one of her estates in the country
               which lay very near to that of Federigo.  And so it befell that
               the urchin began to make friends with Federigo, and to shew a
               fondness for hawks and dogs, and having seen Federigo's falcon fly
               not a few times, took a singular fancy to him, and greatly longed to
               have him for his own, but still did not dare to ask him of Federigo,
               knowing that Federigo prized him so much.  So the matter stood when
               by chance the boy fell sick; whereby the mother was sore distressed, for
               he was her only son, and she loved him as much as might be, insomuch
               that all day long she was beside him, and ceased not to comfort
               him, and again and again asked him if there were aught that he
               wished for, imploring him to say the word, and, if it might by any
               means be had, she would assuredly do her utmost to procure it for
               him.  Thus repeatedly exhorted, the boy said: Mother mine, do
               but get me Federigo's falcon, and I doubt not I shall soon be well.
                Whereupon the lady was silent a while, bethinking her what she
               should do. She knew that Federigo had long loved her, and had
               never had so much as a single kind look from her: wherefore she
               said to herself: How can I send or go to beg of him this falcon,
               which by what I hear is the best that ever flew, and moreover is his
               sole comfort? And how could I be so unfeeling as to seek to deprive
               a gentleman of the one solace that is now left him?  And so, albeit
               she very well knew that she might have the falcon for the asking, she
               was perplexed, and knew not what to say, and gave her son no
               answer. At length, however, the love she bore the boy carried the
               day, and she made up her mind, for his contentment, come what might,
               not to send, but to go herself and fetch him the falcon. So: Be of
               good cheer, my son, she said, and doubt not thou wilt soon be
               well; for I promise thee that the very first thing that I shall do tomorrow
               morning will be to go and fetch thee the falcon.  Whereat
               the child was so pleased that he began to mend that very day.
            </p>
            <p>On the morrow the lady, as if for pleasure, hied her with another
               lady to Federigo's little house, and asked to see him.  'Twas still, as
               for some days past, no weather for hawking, and Federigo was in his
               garden, busy about some small matters which needed to be set right
               there. When he heard that Monna Giovanna was at the door,
               asking to see him, he was not a little surprised and pleased, and hied
               him to her with all speed.  As soon as she saw him, she came
               forward to meet him with womanly grace, and having received his
               respectful salutation, said to him: Good morrow, Federigo, and
               continued: I am come to requite thee for what thou hast lost
               by loving me more than thou shouldst: which compensation is this,
               that I and this lady that accompanies me will breakfast with thee
               without ceremony this morning. Madam, Federigo replied
               with all humility, I mind not ever to have lost aught by loving you,
               but rather to have been so much profited that, if I ever deserved well
               in aught, 'twas to your merit that I owed it, and to the love that I
               bore you.  And of a surety had I still as much to spend as I have
               spent in the past, I should not prize it so much as this visit you so
               frankly pay me, come as you are to one who can afford you but a
               sorry sort of hospitality.  Which said, with some confusion, he
               bade her welcome to his house, and then led her into his garden,
               where, having none else to present to her by way of companion, he
               said: Madam, as there is none other here, this good woman, wife
               of this husbandman, will bear you company, while I go to have the
               table set.  Now, albeit his poverty was extreme, yet he had not
               known as yet how sore was the need to which his extravagance had
               reduced him; but this morning 'twas brought home to him, for that
               he could find nought wherewith to do honour to the lady, for love
               of whom he had done the honours of his house to men without
               number:  wherefore, distressed beyond measure, and inwardly cursing
               his evil fortune, he sped hither and thither like one beside himself,
               but never a coin found he, nor yet aught to pledge. Meanwhile it
               grew late, and sorely he longed that the lady might not leave his
               house altogether unhonoured, and yet to crave help of his own
               husbandman was more than his pride could brook. In these desperate
               straits his glance happened to fall on his brave falcon on his perch in
               his little parlour. And so, as a last resource, he took him, and finding
               him plump, deemed that he would make a dish meet for such a
               lady.  Wherefore, without thinking twice about it, he wrung the
               bird's neck, and caused his maid forthwith pluck him and set him on
               a spit, and roast him carefully; and having still some spotless table-linen,
               he had the table laid therewith, and with a cheerful countenance
               hied him back to his lady in the garden, and told her that such
               breakfast as he could give her was ready.  So the lady and her companion
               rose and came to table, and there, with Federigo, who waited on
               them most faithfully, ate the brave falcon, knowing not what they ate.
            </p>
            <p>When they were risen from table, and had dallied a while in gay
               converse with him, the lady deemed it time to tell the reason of her
               visit: wherefore, graciously addressing Federigo, thus began she:
               Federigo, by what thou rememberest of thy past life and my virtue,
               which, perchance, thou hast deemed harshness and cruelty, I doubt
               not thou must marvel at my presumption, when thou hearest the
               main purpose of my visit; but if thou hadst sons, or hadst had them, so
               that thou mightest know the full force of the love that is borne them,
               I should make no doubt that thou wouldst hold me in part excused.
               Nor, having a son, may I, for that thou hast none, claim exemption
               from the laws to which all other mothers are subject, and, being thus
               bound to own their sway, I must, though fain were I not, and
               though 'tis neither meet nor right, crave of thee that which I know
               thou dost of all things and with justice prize most highly,  seeing
               that this extremity of thy adverse fortune has left thee nought else
               wherewith to delight, divert and console thee; which gift is no other
               than thy falcon, on which my boy has so set his heart that, if I
               bring him it not, I fear lest he grow so much worse of the malady
               that he has, that thereby it may come to pass that I lose him.  And
               so, not for the love which thou dost bear me, and which may nowise
               bind thee, but for that nobleness of temper, whereof in courtesy
               more conspicuously than in aught else thou hast given proof, I implore
               thee that thou be pleased to give me the bird, that thereby
               I may say that I have kept my son alive, and thus made him for
               aye thy debtor.
            </p>
            <p>No sooner had Federigo apprehended what the lady wanted,
               than, for grief that 'twas not in his power to serve her, because he
               had given her the falcon to eat, he fell a weeping in her presence,
               before he could so much as utter a word. At first the lady supposed
               that 'twas only because he was loath to part with the brave falcon
               that he wept, and as good as made up her mind that he would refuse
               her: however, she awaited with patience Federigo's answer, which
               was on this wise: Madam, since it pleased God that I should set
               my affections upon you there have been matters not a few, in which
               to my sorrow I have deemed Fortune adverse to me; but they have
               all been trifles in comparison of the trick that she now plays me:
               the which I shall never forgive her, seeing that you are come here to
               my poor house, where, while I was rich, you deigned not to come,
               and ask a trifling favour of me, which she has put it out of my
               power to grant: how 'tis so, I will briefly tell you.  When I learned
               that you, of your grace, were minded to breakfast with me, having
               respect to your high dignity and desert, I deemed it due and seemly
               that in your honour I should regale you, to the best of my power,
               with fare of a more excellent quality than is commonly set before
               others;  and, calling to mind the falcon which you now ask of me,
               and his excellence, I judged him meet food for you, and so you have
               had him roasted on the trencher this morning; and well indeed I
               thought I had bestowed him; but, as now I see that you would fain
               have had him in another guise, so mortified am I that I am not able
               to serve you, that I doubt I shall never know peace of mind more.
               In witness whereof he had the feathers and feet and beak of the
               bird brought in and laid before her.
            </p>
            <p> The first thing the lady did, when she had heard Federigo's
               story, and seen the relics of the bird, was to chide him that he had
               killed so fine a falcon to furnish a woman with a breakfast; after
               which the magnanimity of her host, which poverty had been and
               was powerless to impair, elicited no small share of inward commendation.
               Then, frustrate of her hope of possessing the falcon, and
               doubting of her son's recovery, she took her leave with the heaviest
               of hearts, and hied her back to the boy:  who, whether for fretting,
               that he might not have the falcon, or by the unaided energy of his
               disorder, departed this life not many days after, to the exceeding
               great grief of his mother.  For a while she would do nought but
               weep and bitterly bewail herself; but being still young, and left very
               wealthy, she was often urged by her brothers to marry again, and
               though she would rather have not done so, yet being importuned,
               and remembering Federigo's high desert, and the magnificent generosity
               with which he had finally killed his falcon to do her honour,
               she said to her brothers: Gladly, with your consent, would I
               remain a widow, but if you will not be satisfied except I take a
               husband, rest assured that none other will I ever take save Federigo
               degli Alberighi.  Whereupon her brothers derided her, saying:
               Foolish woman, what is't thou sayst? How shouldst thou want
               Federigo, who has not a thing in the world?  To whom she
               answered: My brothers, well wot I that 'tis as you say; but I
               had rather have a man without wealth than wealth without a man.
               The brothers, perceiving that her mind was made up, and knowing
               Federigo for a good man and true, poor though he was, gave her to
               him with all her wealth. And so Federigo, being mated with such
               a wife, and one that he had so much loved, and being very wealthy
               to boot, lived happily, keeping more exact accounts, to the end of his
               days.

               Pietro explains that in the house of <span class="person">Ercolano</span>, with
               whom he was to have supped, there was discovered a

                  whether it be a fault seated in nature, that we are more prone to

            <p>'Tis no great while since there dwelt at <span class="place">Perugia</span> a rich man
               named Pietro di Vinciolo, who rather, perchance, to blind others and
               mitigate the evil repute in which he was held by the citizens of
               <span class="place">Perugia</span>, than for any desire to wed, took a wife:  and such being his
               motive, Fortune provided him with just such a spouse as he merited.
               For the wife of his choice was a stout, red-haired young woman, and
               so hot-blooded that two husbands would have been more to her mind
               than one, whereas one fell to her lot that gave her only a subordinate
               place in his regard.  Which she perceiving, while she knew herself
               to be fair and lusty, and felt herself to be gamesome and fit, waxed
               very wroth, and now and again had high words with her husband,
               and led but a sorry life with him at most times. Then, seeing
               that thereby she was more like to fret herself than to dispose her
               husband to conduct less base, she said to herself:  This poor creature
               deserts me to go walk in pattens in the dry; wherefore it shall
               go hard but I will bring another aboard the ship for the wet weather.
               I married him, and brought him a great and goodly dowry, knowing
               that he was a man, and supposing him to have the desires which men
               have and ought to have; and had I not deemed him to be a man,
               I should never have married him.  He knew me to be a woman:
               why then took he me to wife, if women were not to his mind?
               'Tis not to be endured.  Had I not been minded to live in the
               world, I had become a nun; and being minded there to live, as I
               am, if I am to wait until I have pleasure or solace of him, I shall
               wait perchance until I am old; and then, too late, I shall bethink
               me to my sorrow that I have wasted my youth; and as to the way
               in which I should seek its proper solace I need no better teacher and
               guide than him, who finds his delight where I should find mine,  and
               finds it to his own condemnation, whereas in me 'twere commendable.
               'Tis but the laws that I shall set at nought, whereas he sets
               both them and Nature herself at nought.
            </p>
            <p>So the good lady reasoned, and peradventure more than once;
               and then, casting about how she might privily compass her end, she
               made friends with an old beldam, that shewed as a veritable Santa
               Verdiana, foster-mother of vipers, who was ever to be seen going to
               pardonings with a parcel of paternosters in her hand, and talked of
               nothing but the lives of the holy Fathers, and the wounds of St.
               Francis, and was generally reputed a saint;  to whom in due time
               she opened her whole mind. My daughter, replied the beldam,
               God, who knows all things, knows that thou wilt do very rightly
               indeed: were it for no other reason, 'twould be meet for thee and
               every other young woman so to do, that the heyday of youth be not
               wasted; for there is no grief like that of knowing that it has been
               wasted.  And what the devil are we women fit for when we are old
               --except to pore over the cinders on the hearth? The which if any
               know, and may attest it, 'tis I, who, now that I am old, call to mind
               the time that I let slip from me, not without most sore and bitter
               and fruitless regret:  and albeit 'twas not all wasted, for I would not
               have thee think that I was entirely without sense, yet I did not
               make the best use of it: whereof when I bethink me, and that I am
               now, even as thou seest me, such a hag that never a spark of fire may
               I hope to get from any, God knows how I rue it.  Now with men
               'tis otherwise: they are born meet for a thousand uses, not for this
               alone; and the more part of them are of much greater consequence
               in old age than in youth: but women are fit for nought but this,
               and 'tis but for that they bear children that they are cherished.
               Whereof, if not otherwise, thou mayst assure thyself, if thou do but
               consider that we are ever ready for it; which is not the case with
               men; besides which, one woman will tire out many men without
               being herself tired out. Seeing then that 'tis for this we are born, I
               tell thee again that thou wilt do very rightly to give thy husband thy
               loaf for his cake, that in thy old age thy soul may have no cause of
               complaint against thy flesh.  Every one has just as much of this life
               as he appropriates: and this is especially true of women, whom
               therefore it behoves, much more than men, to seize the moment as
               it flies: indeed, as thou mayst see for thyself, when we grow old
               neither husband, nor any other man will spare us a glance; but, on
               the contrary, they banish us to the kitchen, there to tell stories to the
               cat, and to count the pots and pans;  or, worse, they make rhymes
               about us: 'To the damsel dainty bits; to the beldam ague-fits;' and
               such-like catches.  But to make no more words about it, I tell thee
               at once that there is no person in the world to whom thou couldst
               open thy mind with more advantage than to me; for there is no
               gentleman so fine but I dare speak my mind to him, nor any so harsh
               and forbidding but I know well how to soften him and fashion him
               to my will.  Tell me only what thou wouldst have, and leave the
               rest to me: but one word more: I pray thee to have me in kindly
               remembrance, for that I am poor; and thou shalt henceforth go
               shares with me in all my indulgences and every paternoster that I
               say, that God may make thereof light and tapers for thy dead:
               wherewith she ended.
            </p>
            <p>So the lady came to an understanding with the beldam, that, as
               soon as she set eyes on a boy that often came along that street, and
               of whom the lady gave her a particular description, she would know
               what she was to do: and thereupon the lady gave her a chunk
               of salt meat, and bade her God-speed.  The beldam before long
               smuggled into the lady's chamber the boy of whom she had spoken,
               and not long after another, such being the humour of the lady, who,
               standing in perpetual dread of her husband, was disposed, in this
               particular,
               to make the most of her opportunities.  And one of these
               days, her husband being to sup in the evening with a friend named
               <span class="person">Ercolano</span>, the lady bade the beldam bring her a boy as pretty and
               dainty as was to be found in <span class="place">Perugia</span>; and so the beldam forthwith
               did.  But the lady and the boy being set at table to sup, lo, Pietro's
               voice was heard at the door, bidding open to him.  Whereupon the
               lady gave herself up for dead; but being fain, if she might, to screen
               the boy, and knowing not where else to convey or conceal him,
               bestowed him under a hen-coop that stood in a veranda hard by the
               chamber in which they were supping, and threw over it a sorry
               mattress that she had that day emptied of its straw; which done she
               hastened to open the door to her husband;  saying to him as he
               entered: You have gulped your supper mighty quickly to-night.
               Whereto Pietro replied: We have not so much as tasted it.
               How so? enquired the lady. 
               I will tell thee, said Pietro.
               No sooner were we set at table, <span class="person">Ercolano</span>, his wife, and I, than we
               heard a sneeze close to us, to which, though 'twas repeated, we paid
               no heed; but as the sneezer continued to sneeze a third, a fourth, a
               fifth, and many another time to boot, we all began to wonder,  and
               <span class="person">Ercolano</span>, who was somewhat out of humour with his wife, because
               she had kept us a long time at the door before she opened it, burst
               out in a sort of rage with:  'What means this? Who is't that
               thus sneezes?' and made off to a stair hard by, beneath which and
               close to its foot was a wooden closet, of the sort which, when folk are
               furnishing their houses, they commonly cause to be placed there, to
               stow things in upon occasion.  And as it seemed to him that the
               sneezing proceeded thence, he undid the wicket, and no sooner had
               he opened it than out flew never so strong a stench of brimstone;
               albeit we had already been saluted by a whiff of it, and complained
               thereof, but had been put off by the lady with:  ''Tis but that a
               while ago I bleached my veils with brimstone, having sprinkled it
               on a dish, that they might catch its fumes, which dish I then placed
               under the stair, so that it still smells a little.'
            </p>
            <p>However the door being now, as I have said, open, and the
               smoke somewhat less dense, <span class="person">Ercolano</span>, peering in, espied the fellow
               that had sneezed, and who still kept sneezing, being thereto constrained
               by the pungency of the brimstone. And for all he sneezed,
               yet was he by this time so well-nigh choked with the brimstone that
               he was like neither to sneeze nor to do aught else again.  As soon as
               he caught sight of him, <span class="person">Ercolano</span> bawled out: 'Now see I, Madam,
               why it was that a while ago, when we came here, we were kept
               waiting so long at the gate before 'twas opened; but woe be???ide me
               for the rest of my days, if I pay you not out.'  Whereupon the lady,
               perceiving that her offence was discovered, ventured no excuse, but
               fled from the table, whither I know not.  <span class="person">Ercolano</span>, ignoring his
               wife's flight, bade the sneezer again and again to come forth; but
               he, being by this time fairly spent, budged not an inch for aught that
               <span class="person">Ercolano</span> said. Wherefore <span class="person">Ercolano</span> caught him by one of his feet,
               and dragged him forth, and ran off for a knife with intent to kill
               him;  but I, standing in fear of the Signory on my own account, got
               up and would not suffer him to kill the fellow or do him any hurt,
               and for his better protection raised the alarm, whereby some of the
               neighbours came up and took the lad, more dead than alive, and bore
               him off, I know not whither. However, our supper being thus rudely
               interrupted, not only have not gulped it, but I have not so much as
               tasted it, as I said before.
            </p>
            <p>Her husband's story shewed his wife that there were other ladies
               as knowing as she, albeit misfortune might sometimes overtake them;
               and gladly would she have spoken out in defence of <span class="person">Ercolano</span>'s wife,
               but, thinking that, by censuring another's sin, she would secure more
               scope for her own, she launched out on this wise: Fine doings
               indeed, a right virtuous and saintly lady she must be: here is the
               loyalty of an honest woman, and one to whom I had lief have confessed,
               so spiritual I deemed her; and the worst of it is that, being
               no longer young, she sets a rare example to those that are so.  Curses
               on the hour that she came into the world: curses upon her that she
               make not away with herself, basest, most faithless of women that she
               must needs be, the reproach of her sex, the opprobrium of all the
               ladies of this city, to cast aside all regard for her honour, her marriage
               vow, her reputation before the world, and, lost to all sense of shame,
               to scruple not to bring disgrace upon a man so worthy, a citizen so
               honourable, a husband by whom she was so well treated, ay, and
               upon herself to boot!  By my hope of salvation no mercy should be
               shewn to such women; they should pay the penalty with their lives;
               to the fire with them while they yet live, and let them be burned to
               ashes.  Then, calling to mind the lover that she had close at hand
               in the hen-coop, she fell to coaxing Pietro to get him to bed, for the
               hour grew late. Pietro, who was more set on eating than sleeping,
               only asked whether there was aught he might have by way of supper.
               Supper, forsooth! replied the lady. Ay, of course 'tis our way
               to make much of supper when thou art not at home. As if I were
               <span class="person">Ercolano</span>'s wife! Now, wherefore tarry longer? Go, get thy night's
               rest: 'twere far better for thee.
            </p>
            <p>Now so it was that some of Pietro's husbandmen had come to
               the house that evening with divers things from the farm, and had
               put up their asses in a stable that adjoined the veranda, but had
               neglected to water them; and one of the asses being exceeding
               thirsty, got his head out of the halter and broke loose from the stable,
               and went about nosing everything, if haply he might come by water:
               whereby he came upon the hen-coop, beneath which was the boy;
               who, being constrained to stand on all fours, had the fingers of one
               hand somewhat protruding from under the hen-coop; and so as luck
               or rather ill-luck would have it, the ass trod on them; whereat, being
               sorely hurt, he set up a great howling,  much to the surprise of Pietro,
               who perceived that 'twas within his house. So forth he came, and
               hearing the boy still moaning and groaning, for the ass still kept his
               hoof hard down on the fingers, called out: Who is there? and
               ran to the hen-coop and raised it, and espied the fellow, who, besides
               the pain that the crushing of his fingers by the ass's hoof occasioned
               him, trembled in every limb for fear that Pietro should do him a
               mischief.  He was one that Pietro had long been after for his foul
               purposes: so Pietro, recognizing him, asked him: What dost
               thou here? The boy making no answer, save to beseech him for
               the love of God to do him no hurt,  Pietro continued: Get up,
               have no fear that I shall hurt thee; but tell me: How, and for
               what cause comest thou to be here? 
               The boy then confessed
               everything. Whereupon Pietro, as elated by the discovery as his wife
               was distressed, took him by the hand; and led him into the room
               where the lady in the extremity of terror awaited him;  and, having
               seated himself directly in front of her, said: 'Twas but a moment
               ago that thou didst curse <span class="person">Ercolano</span>'s wife, and averred that she ought
               to be burned, and that she was the reproach of your sex: why saidst
               thou not, of thyself? Or, if thou wast not minded to accuse thyself,
               how hadst thou the effrontery to censure her, knowing that thou
               hadst done even as she? Verily 'twas for no other reason than that
               ye are all fashioned thus, and study to cover your own misdeeds with
               the delinquencies of others: would that fire might fall from heaven
               and burn you all, brood of iniquity that ye are!
            </p>
            <p>The lady, marking that in the first flush of his wrath he had
               given her nothing worse than hard words, and discerning, as she
               thought, that he was secretly overjoyed to hold so beautiful a boy by
               the hand, took heart of grace and said: I doubt not indeed that
               thou wouldst be well pleased that fire should fall from heaven and
               devour us all, seeing that thou art as fond of us as a dog is of the
               stick, though by the Holy Rood thou wilt be disappointed;  but I
               would fain have a little argument with thee, to know whereof thou
               complainest. Well indeed were it with me, didst thou but place me
               on an equality with <span class="person">Ercolano</span>'s wife, who is an old sanctimonious
               hypocrite, and has of him all that she wants, and is cherished by him
               as a wife should be: but that is not my case.  For, granted that
               thou givest me garments and shoes to my mind, thou knowest how
               otherwise ill bested I am, and how long it is since last thou didst lie
               with me; and far liefer had I go barefoot and in rags, and have thy
               benevolence abed, than have all that I have, and be treated as thou
               dost treat me.  Understand me, Pietro, be reasonable; consider that
               I am a woman like other women, with the like craving; whereof
               if thou deny me the gratification, 'tis no blame to me that I seek it
               elsewhere; and at least I do thee so much honour as not forgather
               with stable-boys or scurvy knaves.
            </p>
            <p>Pietro perceived that she was like to continue in this vein the
               whole night: wherefore, indifferent as he was to her, he said:
               Now, Madam, no more of this; in the matter of which thou
               speakest I will content thee; but of thy great courtesy let us have
               something to eat by way of supper; for, methinks, the boy, as well
               as I, has not yet supped. Ay, true enough, said the lady, he
               has not supped; for we were but just sitting down to table to sup,
               when, beshrew thee, thou madest thy appearance. Go then,
               said Pietro, get us some supper; and by and by I will arrange this
               affair in such a way that thou shalt have no more cause of complaint.
               The lady, perceiving that her husband was now tranquil, rose, and
               soon had the table laid again and spread with the supper which she
               had ready; and so they made a jolly meal of it, the caitiff husband,
               the lady and the boy.  What after supper Pietro devised for their
               mutual satisfaction has slipped from my memory. But so much as
               this I know, that on the morrow as he wended his way to the piazza,
               the boy would have been puzzled to say, whether of the twain, the
               wife or the husband, had had the most of his company during the
               night.  But this I would say to you, dear my ladies, that whoso
               gives you tit, why, just give him tat; and if you cannot do it at
               once, why, bear it in mind until you can, that even as the ass gives,
               so he may receive.

            <h3 class="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
            <p><span class="person">Dioneo</span>'s story, whereat the ladies laughed the less for shamefastness
               rather than for disrelish, being ended, the queen, taking
               note that the term of her sovereignty was come, rose to her feet,
               and took off the laurel wreath and set it graciously upon Elisa's
               head, saying:  Madam, 'tis now your turn to bear sway.  The
               dignity accepted, Elisa followed in all respects the example of her
               predecessors: she first conferred with the seneschal, and directed him
               how meetly to order all things during the time of her sovereignty;
               which done to the satisfaction of the company: Ofttimes, quoth
               she, have we heard how with bright sallies, and ready retorts, and
               sudden devices, not a few have known how to repugn with apt checks
               the bites of others, or to avert imminent perils; and because 'tis an
               excellent argument, and may be profitable, I ordain that to-morrow,
               God helping us, the following be the rule of our discourse; to wit,
               that it be of such as by some sprightly sally have repulsed an attack,
               or by some ready retort or device have avoided loss, peril or scorn.
               The rule being heartily approved by all, the queen rose and dismissed
               them till supper-time.  So the honourable company, seeing the queen
               risen, rose all likewise, and as their wont was, betook them to their
               diversions as to each seemed best.  But when the cicalas had hushed
               their chirping, all were mustered again for supper; and having blithely
               feasted, they all addressed them to song and dance.  And the queen,
               while <span class="person">Emilia</span> led a dance, called for a song from <span class="person">Dioneo</span>, who at once
               came out with: Monna Aldruda, come perk up thy mood, a piece
               of glad tidings I bring thee.  Whereat all the ladies fell a laughing,
               and most of all the queen, who bade him give them no more of that,
               but sing another.  Quoth <span class="person">Dioneo</span>: Madam, had I a tabret, I
               	would sing: Up with your smock, Monna Lapa! or: Oh!
               the greensward under the olive! Or perchance you had liefer I
               	should give you: Woe is me, the wave of the sea! But no tabret
               have I: wherefore choose which of these others you will have.
               	Perchance you would like: Now hie thee to us forth, that so it
               may be cut, as May the fields about. No, returned the queen,
               give us another. Then, said <span class="person">Dioneo</span>, I will sing: Monna
               Simona, embarrel, embarrel. Why, 'tis not the month of October.
               The
               	song is evidently amoebean.
               Now a plague upon thee, said the queen, with a laugh; give us
               	a proper song, wilt thou? for we will have none of these. Never
               	fear, Madam, replied <span class="person">Dioneo</span>; only say which you prefer. I have
               	more than a thousand songs by heart. Perhaps you would like:
               	This my little covert, make I ne'er it overt; or: 
               	Gently, gently,
               	  husband mine; or: A hundred pounds were none too high a
               	price for me a cock to buy.  The queen now shewed some offence,
               though the other ladies laughed, and: A truce to thy jesting,
               	<span class="person">Dioneo</span>, said she, and give us a proper song: else thou mayst prove
               	the quality of my ire.  Whereupon <span class="person">Dioneo</span> forthwith ceased his
               fooling, and sang on this wise:
            </p>
            <div class="song">So ravishing a light
               Doth from the fair eyes of my mistress move
               As keeps me slave to her and thee, O Love.A beam from those bright orbs did radiate
               That flame that through mine own eyes to my breast
               Did whilom entrance gain.
               Thy majesty, O Love, thy might, how great
               They be, 'twas her fair face did manifest:
               Whereon to brood still fain,
               I felt thee take and chain
               Each sense, my soul enthralling on such wise
               That she alone henceforth evokes my sighs.Wherefore, O dear my Lord, myself I own
               Thy slave, and, all obedience, wait and yearn,
               Till thy might me console.
               Yet wot I not if it be throughly known
               How noble is the flame wherewith I burn,
               My loyalty how whole
               To her that doth control
               Ev'n in such sort my mind that shall I none,
               Nor would I, peace receive, save hers alone.And so I pray thee, sweet my Lord, that thou
               Give her to feel thy fire, and shew her plain
               How grievous my disease.
               This service deign to render; for that now
               Thou seest me waste for love, and in the pain
               Dissolve me by degrees:
               And then the apt moment seize
               My cause to plead with her, as is but due
               From thee to me, who fain with thee would sue.
            </div>
            <p>When <span class="person">Dioneo</span>'s silence shewed that his song was ended, the
               queen accorded it no stinted meed of praise; after which she
               caused not a few other songs to be sung.  Thus passed some part
               of the night; and then the queen, taking note that its freshness had
               vanquished the heat of the day, bade all go rest them, if they would,
               till the morning.
