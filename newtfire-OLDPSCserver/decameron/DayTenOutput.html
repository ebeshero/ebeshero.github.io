            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>Some cloudlets in the West still shewed a vermeil flush, albeit
               those of the eastern sky, as the sun's rays smote them anear, were
               already fringed as with most lucent gold, when uprose Pamfilo, and
               roused the ladies and his comrades. And all the company being
               assembled, and choice made of the place whither they should betake
               them for their diversion, he, accompanied by <span class="person">Filomena</span> and <span class="person">Fiammetta</span>,
               led the way at a slow pace, followed by all the rest. So fared they
               no little space, beguiling the time with talk of their future way of
               life, whereof there was much to tell and much to answer, until, as
               the sun gained strength, they returned, having made quite a long
               round, to the palace;  and being gathered about the fountain, such as
               were so minded drank somewhat from beakers rinsed in its pure
               waters; and then in the delicious shade of the garden they hied them
               hither and thither, taking their pleasure until breakfast-time. Their
               meal taken, they slept as they were wont; and then, at a spot chosen
               by the king, they reassembled, where <span class="person">Neifile</span>, having received his
               command to lead the way, blithely thus began.

            <h3 style="text-align:center">Novel I</h3>
            <p>A knight in the service of the King of <span class="place">Spain</span> deems
               himself ill requited. Wherefore the King, by most
               cogent proof, shews him that the blame rests not with
               him, but with the knight's own evil fortune; after
               which, he bestows upon him a noble gift.
            </p>
            <div class="frame">
               <p>Highly graced, indeed, do I deem myself, honourable my ladies,
                  that our king should have given to me the precedence in a matter so
                  arduous to tell of as magnificence: for, as the sun irradiates all the
                  heaven with his glory and beauty, even so does magnificence enhance
                  the purity and the splendour of every other virtue. I shall therefore
                  tell you a story, which, to my thinking, is not a little pretty; and
                  which, assuredly, it must be profitable to call to mind.
               </p>
            </div>
            <p>You are to know, then, that, among other honourable knights
               that from days of old even until now have dwelt in our city, one, and
               perchance the worthiest of all, was Messer Ruggieri de' <span class="person">Figiovanni</span>.
               Who, being wealthy and magnanimous, reflecting on the customs and
               manner of life of <span class="place">Tuscany</span>, perceived that by tarrying there he was
               like to find little or no occasion of shewing his mettle, and accordingly
               resolved to pass some time at the court of Alfonso, King of <span class="place">Spain</span>,
               who for the fame of his high qualities was without a peer among the
               potentates of his age. So, being well provided with arms and horses
               and retinue suitable to his rank, he hied him to <span class="place">Spain</span>, where he was
               graciously received by the King.  There tarrying accordingly, Messer
               Ruggieri very soon, as well by the splendid style in which he lived
               as by the prodigious feats of arms that he did, gave folk to know his
               high desert.
            </p>
            <p>Now, having tarried there some while, and observed the King's
               ways with much care, and how he would grant castles, cities, or
               baronies, to this, that, or the other of his subjects, he deemed that
               the King shewed therein but little judgment, seeing that he would
               give them to men that merited them not. And for that nought was
               given to him, he, knowing his merit, deemed himself gravely injured
               in reputation; wherefore he made up his mind to depart the realm,
               and to that end craved license of the King;  which the King granted
               him, and therewith gave him one of the best and finest mules that
               was ever ridden, a gift which Messer Ruggieri, as he had a long
               journey to make, did not a little appreciate.  The King then bade
               one of his discreet domestics contrive, as best he might, to ride with
               Messer Ruggieri on such wise that it might not appear that he did
               so by the King's command, and charge his memory with whatever
               Messer Ruggieri might say of him, so that he might be able to repeat
               it; which done, he was on the very next morning to bid Ruggieri
               return to the King forthwith.  The King's agent was on the
               alert, and no sooner was Ruggieri out of the city, than without any
               manner of difficulty he joined his company, giving out that he was
               going towards <span class="place">Italy</span>.  As thus they rode, talking of divers matters,
               Messer Ruggieri being mounted on the mule given him by the
               King: Methinks, quoth the other, it being then hard upon
               tierce, that 'twere well to give the beasts a voidance;  and by and
               by, being come to a convenient place, they voided all the beasts save
               the mule. Then, as they continued their journey, the squire
               hearkening attentively to the knight's words, they came to a river,
               and while there they watered the beasts, the mule made a voidance
               in the stream. Whereat: Ah, foul fall thee, beast, quoth
               Messer Ruggieri, that art even as thy master, that gave thee to me!
               Which remark, as also many another that fell from Ruggieri as they
               rode together throughout the day, the squire stored in his memory;
               but never another word did he hear Ruggieri say touching the King,
               that was not laudatory to the last degree.
            </p>
            <p>On the morrow, when they were gotten to horse, and had set
               their faces towards <span class="place">Tuscany</span>, the squire apprised Ruggieri of the
               King's command, and thereupon Ruggieri turned back.  On his
               arrival the King, having already heard what he had said touching the
               mule, gave him gladsome greeting, and asked him wherefore he had
               likened him to the mule, or rather the mule to him.  Whereto
               Messer Ruggieri answered frankly: My lord, I likened you to the
               mule, for that, as you bestow your gifts where 'tis not meet, and
               where meet it were, bestow them not, so the mule where 'twas meet,
               voided not, and where 'twas not meet, voided.  Messer Ruggieri,
               replied the King, 'tis not because I have not discerned in you a
               knight most good and true, for whose desert no gift were too great,
               that I have not bestowed on you such gifts as I have bestowed upon
               many others, who in comparison of you are nothing worth: the
               fault is none of mine but solely of your fortune, which would not
               suffer me; and that this which I say is true, I will make abundantly
               plain to you.  My lord, returned Messer Ruggieri, mortified
               am I, not that you gave me no gift, for thereof I had no desire, being
               too rich, but that you made no sign of recognition of my desert;
               however, I deem your explanation sound and honourable, and
               whatever you shall be pleased that I should see, that gladly will I,
               albeit I believe you without attestation.
            </p>
            <p>The King then led him into one of the great halls, in which, by
               his preordinance, were two chests closed under lock and key, and, not
               a few others being present, said to him: Messer Ruggieri, one of
               these chests contains my crown, sceptre and orb, with many a fine
               girdle, buckle, ring, and whatever else of jewellery I possess; the
               other is full of earth: choose then, and whichever you shall choose,
               be it yours; thereby you will discover whether 'tis due to me or to
               your fortune that your deserts have lacked requital.  Such being the
               King's pleasure, Messer Ruggieri chose one of the chests, which at
               the King's command being opened and found to be that which
               contained the earth: Now, Messer Ruggieri, quoth the King
               with a laugh, your own eyes may warrant you of the truth of what
               I say touching Fortune; but verily your merit demands that I take
               arms against her in your cause.  I know that you are not minded to
               become a Spaniard, and therefore I shall give you neither castle nor
               city; but that chest, which Fortune denied you, I bestow on you in
               her despite, that you may take it with you to your own country, and
               there with your neighbours justly vaunt yourself of your deserts,
               attested by my gifts.  Messer Ruggieri took the chest, and having
               thanked the King in a manner befitting such a gift, returned therewith,
               well pleased, to <span class="place">Tuscany</span>.

            <p>Ghino di Tacco captures the Abbot of Cluny, cures him of

            <div class="frame">
               <p>When an end was made of extolling the magnificence shewn by
                  King Alfonso towards the Florentine knight, the king, who had
                  listened to the story with no small pleasure, bade Elisa follow suit;
                  and forthwith Elisa began:

            </div>
            <div class="frame">
               <p>Dainty my ladies, undeniable it is that
                  for a king to be magnificent, and to entreat magnificently one that
                  has done him service, is a great matter, and meet for commendation.
                  What then shall we say when the tale is of a dignitary of the Church
                  that shewed wondrous magnificence towards one whom he might
                  well have entreated as an enemy, and not have been blamed by a
                  soul?  Assuredly nought else than that what in the king was virtue
                  was in the prelate nothing less than a miracle, seeing that for superlative
                  greed the clergy, one and all, outdo us women, and wage war
                  to the knife upon every form of liberality. And albeit all men are
                  by nature prone to avenge their wrongs, 'tis notorious that the clergy,
                  however they may preach longsuffering, and commend of all things
                  the forgiving of trespasses, are more quick and hot to be avenged
                  than the rest of mankind. Now this, to wit, after what manner a
                  prelate shewed magnificence, will be made manifest to you in my
                  story.
               </p>
            </div>
            <p>Ghino di Tacco, a man redoubtable by reason of his truculence
               and his high-handed deeds, being banished from <span class="place">Siena</span>, and at enmity
               with the Counts of Santa Fiore, raised <span class="place">Radicofani</span> in revolt against
               the Church of <span class="place">Rome</span>, and there abiding, harried all the surrounding
               country with his soldiers, plundering all wayfarers.  Now Pope
               Boniface VIII. being at <span class="place">Rome</span>, there came to court the Abbot
               of Cluny, who is reputed one of the wealthiest prelates in the
               world; and having there gotten a disorder of the stomach, he was
               advised by the physicians to go to the baths of <span class="place">Siena</span>, where (they
               averred) he would certainly be cured. So, having obtained the
               Pope's leave, reckless of the bruit of Ghino's exploits, he took the
               road, being attended by a great and well-equipped train of sumpter-horses
               and servants.  Ghino di Tacco, getting wind of his approach,
               spread his nets to such purpose as without the loss of so much as a
               boy to surround the abbot, with all his servants and effects, in a
               strait pass, from which there was no exit. Which done, he sent
               one of his men, the cunningest of them all, with a sufficient retinue to
               the abbot, who most lovingly on Ghino's part besought the abbot to
               come and visit Ghino at the castle.  Whereto the abbot, very wroth,
               made answer that he would none of it, for that nought had he to do
               with Ghino; but that he purposed to continue his journey, and
               would fain see who would hinder him.  Sir, returned the envoy,
               assuming a humble tone, you are come to a part of the country
               where we have no fear of aught save the might of God, and where
               excommunications and interdicts are one and all under the ban;
               wherefore you were best be pleased to shew yourself agreeable to
               Ghino in this particular.  As they thus spoke, Ghino's soldiers
               shewed themselves on every side, and it being thus manifest to the
               abbot that he and his company were taken prisoners, he, albeit
               mightily incensed, suffered himself with all his train and effects to be
               conducted by the envoy to the castle; where the abbot, being
               alighted, was lodged in a small and very dark and discomfortable
               room, while his retinue, according to their several conditions, were
               provided with comfortable quarters in divers parts of the castle, the
               horses well stabled and all the effects secured, none being in any
               wise tampered with.  Which done, Ghino hied him to the abbot,
               and: Sir, quoth he, Ghino, whose guest you are, sends me to
               entreat you to be pleased to inform him of your destination, and the
               purpose of your journey.  The abbot, vailing his pride like a wise
               man, told whither he was bound and for what purpose. Whereupon
               Ghino left him, casting about how he might cure him without a
               bath. To which end he kept a great fire ever burning in the little
               chamber, and had it closely guarded, and returned not to the abbot
               until the ensuing morning, when he brought him in a spotless napkin
               two slices of toast and a great beaker of vernaccia of <span class="place">Corniglia</span>, being
               of the abbot's own vintage;  and: Sir, quoth he to the abbot,
               Ghino, as a young man, made his studies in medicine, and avers that
               he then learned that there is no better treatment for disorder of the
               stomach than that which he will afford you, whereof the matters
               that I bring you are the beginning; wherefore take them and be of
               good cheer.
            </p>
            <p>The abbot, being far too hungry to make many words about the
               matter, ate (albeit in high dudgeon) the toast, and drank the vernaccia;
               which done, he enlarged on his wrongs in a high tone, with
               much questioning and perpending; and above all he demanded to see
               Ghino.  Part of what the abbot said Ghino disregarded as of no
               substance, to other part he replied courteously enough; and having
               assured him that Ghino would visit him as soon as might be, he took
               his leave of him; nor did he return until the morrow, when he
               brought him toast and vernaccia in the same quantity as before;
               and so he kept him several days: then, having marked that the
               abbot had eaten some dried beans that he had secretly brought and
               left there of set purpose,  he asked him in Ghino's name how he
               felt in the stomach. Were I but out of Ghino's hands, replied the
               abbot, I should feel myself well, indeed: next to which, I desire
               most of all a good breakfast, so excellent a cure have his medicines
               wrought on me.  Whereupon Ghino caused the abbot's servants to
               furnish a goodly chamber with the abbot's own effects, and there
               on the morrow make ready a grand banquet, at which all the abbot's
               suite and not a few of the garrison being assembled, he hied him to
               the abbot, and: Sir, quoth he, 'tis time you left the infirmary,
               seeing that you now feel yourself well; and so saying, he took him
               by the hand, and led him into the chamber made ready for him, and
               having left him there with his own people, made it his chief concern
               that the banquet should be magnificent.  The abbot's spirits revived
               as he found himself again among his men, with whom he talked a
               while, telling them how he had been entreated, wherewith they
               contrasted the signal honour which they, on the other hand, had,
               one and all, received from Ghino.
            </p>
            <p>Breakfast-time came, and with order meet the abbot and the
               rest were regaled with good viands and good wines, Ghino still
               suffering not the abbot to know who he was.  But when the abbot
               had thus passed several days, Ghino, having first had all his effects
               collected in a saloon, and all his horses, to the poorest jade, in the
               courtyard below, hied him to the abbot and asked him how he felt,
               and if he deemed himself strong enough to ride. The abbot replied
               that he was quite strong enough, and that 'twould be well indeed
               with him, were he once out of Ghino's hands.  Ghino then led him
               into the saloon in which were his effects and all his retinue, and
               having brought him to a window, whence he might see all his horses:
               Sir Abbot, quoth he, you must know that 'tis not for that he
               has an evil heart, but because, being a gentleman, he is banished from
               his home, and reduced to poverty, and has not a few powerful enemies,
               that in defence of his life and honour, Ghino di Tacco, whom you see
               before you, has become a robber of highways and an enemy to the
               court of <span class="place">Rome</span>.  But such as I am, I have cured you of your malady
               of the stomach, and taking you to be a worthy lord, I purpose not to
               treat you as I would another, from whom, were he in my hands, as
               you are, I should take such part of his goods as I should think fit;
               but I shall leave it to you, upon consideration of my need, to assign
               to me such portion of your goods as you yourself shall determine.
               Here are they before you undiminished and unimpaired, and from
               this window you may see your horses below in the courtyard;
               wherefore take the part or take the whole, as you may see fit, and
               be it at your option to tarry here, or go hence, from this hour
               forth.
            </p>
            <p>The abbot marvelled to hear a highway robber speak thus
               liberally, and such was his gratification that his wrath and fierce
               resentment departed from him, nay, were transformed into kindness,
               insomuch that in all cordial amity he hasted to embrace Ghino,
               saying:  By God I swear, that to gain the friendship of a man such
               I now deem thee to be, I would be content to suffer much greater
               wrong than that which until now, meseemed, thou hadst done me.
               Cursed be Fortune that constrains thee to ply so censurable a trade.
               Which said, he selected a very few things, and none superfluous,
               from his ample store, and having done likewise with the horses, ceded
               all else to Ghino, and hied him back to <span class="place">Rome</span>;  where, seeing him,
               the Pope, who to his great grief had heard of his capture, asked him
               what benefit he had gotten from the baths. Whereto the abbot
               made answer with a smile: Holy Father, I found nearer here than
               the baths a worthy physician who has wrought a most excellent cure
               on me: he then recounted all the circumstances, whereat the Pope
               laughed. Afterwards, still pursuing the topic, the abbot, yielding to
               the promptings of magnificence, asked a favour of the Pope;  who,
               expecting that he would ask somewhat else than he did, liberally
               promised to give him whatever he should demand. Whereupon:
               Holy Father, quoth the abbot, that which I would crave of you
               is that you restore Ghino di Tacco, my physician, to your favour;
               seeing that among the good men and true and meritorious that I have
               known, he is by no means of the least account. And for the evil life
               that he leads, I impute it to Fortune rather than to him:  change then
               his fortune, by giving him the means whereby he may live in manner
               befitting his rank, and I doubt not that in a little while your
               judgment of him will jump with mine. 
               	Whereto the Pope, being
               magnanimous, and an admirer of good men and true, made answer
               that so he would gladly do, if Ghino should prove to be such as the
               abbot said; and that he would have him brought under safe conduct
               to <span class="place">Rome</span>.  Thither accordingly under safe conduct came Ghino, to
               the abbot's great delight; nor had he been long at court before the
               Pope approved his worth, and restored him to his favour, granting
               him a great office, to wit, that of prior of the Hospital, whereof he
               made him knight. Which office he held for the rest of his life,
               being ever a friend and vassal of Holy Church and the Abbot of
               Cluny.

                  another, did resolve artfully to yield to him his blood, nay, his very
                  life, for which the other thirsted, and had so done, had the other
                  chosen to take them, as I shall shew you in a little story.
               </p>
            </div>
            <p>Beyond all question, if we may believe the report of certain
               Genoese, and other folk that have been in those regions, there dwelt
               of yore in the parts of Cathay one Nathan, a man of noble lineage
               and incomparable wealth.  Who, having a seat hard by a road, by
               which whoso would travel from the West eastward, or from the East
               westward, must needs pass, and being magnanimous and liberal, and
               zealous to approve himself such in act, did set on work cunning
               artificers not a few, and cause one of the finest and largest and most
               luxurious palaces that ever were seen, to be there builded and
               furnished in the goodliest manner with all things meet for the
               reception and honourable entertainment of gentlemen.  And so,
               keeping a great array of excellent servants, he courteously and
               hospitably did the honours of his house to whoso came and went: in
               which laudable way of life he persevered, until not only the East, but
               well-nigh all the West had heard his fame;  which thus, what time
               he was well-stricken in years, albeit not for that cause grown weary
               of shewing courtesy, reached the ears of one <span class="person">Mitridanes</span>, a young man
               of a country not far distant. Who, knowing himself to be no less
               wealthy than Nathan, grew envious of the renown that he had of his
               good deeds, and resolved to obliterate, or at least to obscure it, by a
               yet greater liberality.  So he had built for himself a palace like that
               of Nathan, of which he did the honours with a lavish courtesy that
               none had ever equalled, to whoso came or went that way; and verily
               in a short while he became famous enough.
            </p>
            <p>Now it so befell that on a day when the young man was all alone
               in the courtyard of the palace, there came in by one of the gates a
               poor woman, who asked of him an alms, and had it; but, not content
               therewith, came again to him by the second gate, and asked another
               alms, and had it, and after the like sort did even unto the twelfth
               time; but, she returning for the thirteenth time: My good
               woman, quoth <span class="person">Mitridanes</span>, thou art not a little pertinacious in thy
               begging: howbeit he gave her an alms.  Whereupon: Ah!
               the wondrous liberality of Nathan! quoth the beldam: thirty-two
               gates are there to his palace, by every one of which I have entered,
               and asking alms of him, was never--for aught he shewed--recognized,
               or refused, and here, though I have entered as yet by but
               thirteen gates, I am recognized and reprimanded. And therewith
               she departed, and returned no more.  <span class="person">Mitridanes</span>, who accounted
               the mention of Nathan's fame an abatement of his own, was kindled
               by her words with a frenzy of wrath, and began thus to commune
               with himself: Alas! when shall I attain to the grandeur of
               Nathan's liberality, to say nought of transcending it, as I would fain,
               seeing that in the veriest trifles I cannot approach him? Of a surety
               my labour is in vain, if I rid not the earth of him: which, since old
               age relieves me not of him, I must forthwith do with mine own
               hands.  And in the flush of his despite up he started, and giving
               none to know of his purpose, got to horse with a small company,
               and after three days arrived at the place where Nathan abode; and
               having enjoined his comrades to make as if they were none of his,
               and knew him not, and to go quarter themselves as best they might
               until they had his further orders, he, being thus alone, towards
               evening came upon Nathan, also alone, at no great distance from
               his splendid palace. Nathan was recreating himself by a walk, and
               was very simply clad; so that <span class="person">Mitridanes</span>, knowing him not, asked
               him if he could shew him where Nathan dwelt.  My son, replied
               Nathan gladsomely, that can none in these parts better than I;
               wherefore, so it please thee, I will bring thee thither. 
               The young
               man replied that 'twould be mighty agreeable to him, but that, if so
               it might be, he had a mind to be neither known nor seen by Nathan.
               And herein also, returned Nathan, since 'tis thy pleasure, I will
               gratify thee.  Whereupon <span class="person">Mitridanes</span> dismounted, and with Nathan,
               who soon engaged him in delightsome discourse, walked to the
               goodly palace. Arrived there Nathan caused one of his servants
               take the young man's horse, and drawing close to him, bade him
               in a whisper to see to it without delay that none in the house should
               tell the young man that he was Nathan: and so 'twas done.
            </p>
            <p>Being come into the palace, Nathan quartered <span class="person">Mitridanes</span> in a
               most goodly chamber, where none saw him but those whom he had
               appointed to wait upon him; and he himself kept him company,
               doing him all possible honour.  Of whom <span class="person">Mitridanes</span>, albeit he
               reverenced him as a father, yet, being thus with him, forbore not to
               ask who he was. Whereto Nathan made answer: I am a petty
               servant of Nathan: old as I am, I have been with him since my
               childhood, and never has he advanced me to higher office than this
               wherein thou seest me: wherefore, howsoever other folk may praise
               him, little cause have I to do so.  Which words afforded <span class="person">Mitridanes</span>
               some hope of carrying his wicked purpose into effect with more of
               plan and less of risk than had otherwise been possible. By and by
               Nathan very courteously asked him who he was, and what business
               brought him thither; offering him such counsel and aid as he might
               be able to afford him.  <span class="person">Mitridanes</span> hesitated a while to reply: but
               at last he resolved to trust him, and when with no little circumlocution
               he had demanded of him fidelity, counsel and aid, he fully
               discovered to him who he was, and the purpose and motive of his
               coming thither.  Now, albeit to hear <span class="person">Mitridanes</span> thus unfold his
               norrid design caused Nathan no small inward commotion, yet 'twas
               not long before courageously and composedly he thus made answer:
               Noble was thy father, <span class="person">Mitridanes</span>, and thou art minded to shew
               thyself not unworthy of him by this lofty emprise of thine, to wit,
               of being liberal to all comers: and for that thou art envious of
               Nathan's merit I greatly commend thee; for were many envious
               for a like cause, the world, from being a most wretched, would soon
               become a happy place.  Doubt not that I shall keep secret the
               design which thou hast confided to me, for the furtherance whereof
               'tis good advice rather than substantial aid that I have to offer thee.
               Which advice is this.  Hence, perhaps half a mile off, thou mayst
               see a copse, in which almost every morning Nathan is wont to walk,
               taking his pleasure, for quite a long while: 'twill be an easy matter
               for thee to find him there, and deal with him as thou mayst be
               minded.  Now, shouldst thou slay him, thou wilt get thee home with
               less risk of let, if thou take not the path by which thou camest
               hither, but that which thou seest issue from the copse on the left,
               for, though 'tis somewhat more rough, it leads more directly to thy
               house, and will be safer for thee.
            </p>
            <p>Possessed of this information, <span class="person">Mitridanes</span>, when Nathan had left
               him, privily apprised his comrades, who were likewise lodged in the
               palace, of the place where they were to await him on the ensuing
               day; which being come, Nathan, inflexibly determined to act in all
               respects according to the advice which he had given <span class="person">Mitridanes</span>,
               hied him forth to the copse unattended, to meet his death.  <span class="person">Mitridanes</span>,
               being risen, took his bow and sword, for other arms he had
               none with him, mounted his horse, and rode to the copse, through
               which, while he was yet some way off, he saw Nathan passing, quite
               alone. And being minded, before he fell upon him, to see his face
               and hear the sound of his voice, as, riding at a smart pace, he came
               up with him, he laid hold of him by his head-gear, exclaiming:
               Greybeard, thou art a dead man.  Whereto Nathan answered
               nought but: Then 'tis but my desert.  But <span class="person">Mitridanes</span>, hearing
               the voice, and scanning the face, forthwith knew him for the same
               man that had welcomed him heartily, consorted with him familiarly,
               and counselled him faithfully; whereby his wrath presently subsided,
               and gave place to shame. Wherefore, casting away the sword that
               he held drawn in act to strike, he sprang from his horse, and weeping,
               threw himself at Nathan's feet, saying:  Your liberality, dearest
               father, I acknowledge to be beyond all question, seeing with what
               craft you did plot your coming hither to yield me your life, for
               which, by mine own avowal, you knew that I, albeit cause I had
               none, did thirst. But God, more regardful of my duty than I
               myself, has now, in this moment of supreme stress, opened the eyes
               of my mind, that wretched envy had fast sealed.  The prompter
               was your compliance, the greater is the debt of penitence that I owe
               you for my fault; wherefore wreak even such vengeance upon me
               as you may deem answerable to my transgression.  But Nathan
               raised <span class="person">Mitridanes</span> to his feet, and tenderly embraced him, saying:
               My son, thy enterprise, howsoever thou mayst denote it, whether
               evil or otherwise, was not such that thou shouldst crave, or I give,
               pardon thereof; for 'twas not in malice but in that thou wouldst
               fain have been reputed better than I that thou ensuedst it.  Doubt
               then no more of me; nay, rest assured that none that lives bears
               thee such love as I, who know the loftiness of thy spirit, bent not
               to heap up wealth, as do the caitiffs, but to dispense in bounty thine
               accumulated store.  Think it no shame that to enhance thy reputation
               thou wouldst have slain me; nor deem that I marvel thereat.
               To slay not one man, as thou wast minded, but countless multitudes,
               to waste whole countries with fire, and to raze cities to the ground
               has been well-nigh the sole art, by which the mightiest emperors and
               the greatest kings have extended their dominions, and by consequence
               their fame. Wherefore, if thou, to increase thy fame, wouldst fain
               have slain me, 'twas nothing marvellous or strange, but wonted.
            </p>
            <p>Whereto <span class="person">Mitridanes</span> made answer, not to excuse his wicked
               design, but to commend the seemly excuse found for it by Nathan,
               whom at length he told how beyond measure he marvelled that
               Nathan had not only been consenting to the enterprise, but had
               aided him therein by his counsel. But Nathan answered:  Liefer
               had I, <span class="person">Mitridanes</span>, that thou didst not marvel either at my consent
               or at my counsel, for that, since I was my own master and of a mind
               to that emprise whereon thou art also bent, never a soul came to my
               house, but, so far as in me lay, I gave him all that he asked of me.
               Thou camest, lusting for my life; and so, when I heard thee crave
               it of me, I forthwith, that thou mightst not be the only guest to
               depart hence ill content, resolved to give it thee; and to that end I
               gave thee such counsel as I deemed would serve thee both to the
               taking of my life and the preservation of thine own. Wherefore
               yet again I bid thee, nay, I entreat thee, if so thou art minded, to
               take it for thy satisfaction: I know not how I could better bestow
               it.  I have had the use of it now for some eighty years, and
               pleasure and solace thereof; and I know that, by the course of
               Nature and the common lot of man and all things mundane, it can
               continue to be mine for but a little while; and so I deem that 'twere
               much better to bestow it, as I have ever bestowed and dispensed my
               wealth, than to keep it, until, against my will, it be reft from me by
               Nature.  'Twere but a trifle, though 'twere a hundred years: how
               insignificant, then, the six or eight years that are all I have to give!
               Take it, then, if thou hadst lief, take it, I pray thee; for, long as
               I have lived here, none have I found but thee to desire it; nor know
               I when I may find another, if thou take it not, to demand it of me.
               And if, peradventure, I should find one such, yet I know that the
               longer I keep it, the less its worth will be; wherefore, ere it be thus
               cheapened, take it, I implore thee.
            </p>
            <p>Sore shame-stricken, <span class="person">Mitridanes</span> made answer: Now God
               forefend that I should so much as harbour, as but now I did, such a
               thought, not to say do such a deed, as to wrest from you a thing
               so precious as your life, the years whereof, so far from abridging, I
               would gladly supplement with mine own.  So then, rejoined
               Nathan promptly, thou wouldst, if thou couldst, add thy years to
               mine, and cause me to serve thee as I never yet served any man, to
               wit, to take from thee that which is thine, I that never took aught
               	from a soul! Ay, that would I, returned <span class="person">Mitridanes</span>.  
               Then,
               quoth Nathan, do as I shall bid thee. Thou art young: tarry
               here in my house, and call thyself Nathan; and I will get me to
               thy house, and ever call myself <span class="person">Mitridanes</span>.  Whereto <span class="person">Mitridanes</span>
               made answer: Were I but able to discharge this trust, as you
               have been and are, scarce would I hesitate to accept your offer; but,
               as too sure am I that aught that I might do would but serve to
               lower Nathan's fame, and I am not minded to mar that in another
               which I cannot mend in myself, accept it I will not.
            </p>
            <p>After which and the like interchange of delectable discourse,
               Nathan and <span class="person">Mitridanes</span>, by Nathan's desire, returned to the palace;
               where Nathan for some days honourably entreated <span class="person">Mitridanes</span>, and
               by his sage counsel confirmed and encouraged him in his high and
               noble resolve; after which, <span class="person">Mitridanes</span>, being minded to return
               home with his company, took his leave of Nathan, fully persuaded
               that 'twas not possible to surpass him in liberality.

               <p>A thing marvellous seemed it to all that for liberality a man
                  should be ready to sacrifice his own life; and herein they averred
                  that Nathan had without doubt left the King of <span class="place">Spain</span> and the Abbot

               <p>Goodly matters are they and magnificent that
                  have been recounted to you, young ladies; nay, so much of our

            <p>Know, then, that at <span class="place">Bologna</span>, that most famous city of <span class="place">Lombardy</span>,
               there dwelt a knight, Messer Gentile Carisendi by name, worshipful
               alike for his noble lineage and his native worth: who in his youth,
               being enamoured of a young gentlewoman named Madonna Catalina,
               wife of one Niccoluccio Caccianimico, and well-nigh despairing, for
               that the lady gave him but a sorry requital of his love, betook him
               to <span class="place">Modena</span>, being called thither as Podestà.  Now what time he
               was there, Niccoluccio being also away from <span class="place">Bologna</span>, and his lady
               gone, for that she was with child, to lie in at a house she had some
               three miles or so from the city, it befell that she was suddenly
               smitten with a sore malady of such and so virulent a quality that it
               left no sign of life in her, so that the very physicians pronounced her
               dead.  And for that the women that were nearest of kin to her
               professed to have been told by her, that she was not so far gone in
               pregnancy that the child could be perfectly formed, they, without
               more ado, laid her in a tomb in a neighbouring church, and after
               long lamentation closed it upon her.
            </p>
            <p>Whereof Messer Gentile being forthwith apprised by one of his
               friends, did, for all she had been most niggardly to him of her favour,
               grieve not a little, and at length fell a communing with himself on
               this wise: So, Madonna Catalina, thou art dead! While thou
               livedst, never a glance of thine might I have; wherefore, now that
               thou art dead, 'tis but right that I go take a kiss from thee.  'Twas
               night while he thus mused; and forthwith, observing strict secrecy
               in his departure, he got him to horse with a single servant, and
               halted not until he was come to the place where the lady was interred;
               and having opened the tomb he cautiously entered it. Then, having
               lain down beside her, he set his face against hers; and again and
               again, weeping profusely the while, he kissed it.  But as 'tis matter
               of common knowledge that the desires of men, and more especially
               of lovers, know no bounds, but crave ever an ampler satisfaction;
               even so Messer Gentile, albeit he had been minded to tarry there
               no longer, now said to himself: Wherefore touch I not her bosom
               a while? I have never yet touched it, nor shall I ever touch it
               again.  Obeying which impulse, he laid his hand on her bosom, and
               keeping it there some time, felt, as he thought, her heart faintly
               beating.  Whereupon, banishing all fear, and examining the body
               with closer attention, he discovered that life was not extinct, though
               he judged it but scant and flickering: and so, aided by his servant,
               he bore her, as gently as he might, out of the tomb; and set her
               before him upon his horse, and brought her privily to his house at
               <span class="place">Bologna</span>,  where dwelt his wise and worthy mother, who, being fully
               apprised by him of the circumstances, took pity on the lady, and had
               a huge fire kindled, and a bath made ready, whereby she restored
               her to life. Whereof the first sign she gave was to heave a great
               sigh, and murmur: Alas! where am I?  To which the worthy
               lady made answer: Be of good cheer; thou art well lodged.
               By and by the lady, coming to herself, looked about her; and finding
               herself she knew not where, and seeing Messer Gentile before her,
               was filled with wonder, and besought his mother to tell her how she
               came to be there.
            </p>
            <p>Messer Gentile thereupon told her all.  Sore distressed thereat,
               the lady, after a while, thanked him as best she might; after which
               she besought him by the love that he had borne her, and of his
               courtesy, that she might, while she tarried in his house, be spared
               aught that could impair her honour and her husband's; and that at
               daybreak he would suffer her to return home.  Madam, replied
               Messer Gentile, however I did affect you in time past, since God
               in His goodness has, by means of the love I bore you, restored you
               to me alive, I mean not now, or at any time hereafter, to entreat
               you either here or elsewhere, save as a dear sister;  but yet the
               service I have to-night rendered you merits some guerdon: and
               therefore lief had I that you deny me not a favour which I shall ask
               of you.  Whereto the lady graciously made answer that she would
               be prompt to grant it, so only it were in her power, and consonant
               with her honour. Said then Messer Gentile: Your kinsfolk,
               Madam, one and all, nay, all the folk in <span class="place">Bologna</span> are fully persuaded
               that you are dead: there is therefore none to expect you at home:
               wherefore the favour I crave of you is this, that you will be pleased
               to tarry privily here with my mother, until such time--which will
               be speedily--as I return from <span class="place">Modena</span>.  And 'tis for that I purpose
               to make solemn and joyous donation of you to your husband in
               presence of the most honourable folk of this city that I ask of you
               this grace.  Mindful of what she owed the knight, and witting
               that what he craved was seemly, the lady, albeit she yearned not a
               little to gladden her kinsfolk with the sight of her in the flesh, consented
               to do as Messer Gentile besought her, and thereto pledged
               him her faith.  And scarce had she done so, when she felt that the
               hour of her travail was come; and so, tenderly succoured by Messer
               Gentile's mother, she not long after gave birth to a fine boy. Which
               event did mightily enhance her own and Messer Gentile's happiness.
               Then, having made all meet provision for her, and left word that
               she was to be tended as if she were his own wife, Messer Gentile,
               observing strict secrecy, returned to <span class="place">Modena</span>.
            </p>
            <p>His time of office there ended, in anticipation of his return to
               <span class="place">Bologna</span>, he appointed for the morning of his arrival in the city a
               great and goodly banquet at his house, whereto were bidden not a
               few of the gentlemen of <span class="place">Bologna</span>, and among them Niccoluccio
               Caccianimico. Whom, when he was returned and dismounted, he
               found awaiting him, as also the lady, fairer and more healthful than
               ever, and her little son doing well; and so with a gladness beyond
               compare he ranged his guests at table, and regaled them with many
               a course magnificently served.  And towards the close of the feast,
               having premonished the lady of his intention, and concerted with
               her how she should behave, thus he spoke: Gentlemen, I mind
               me to have once heard tell of (as I deem it) a delightsome custom
               which they have in <span class="place">Persia</span>; to wit, that, when one would do his
               friend especial honour, he bids him to his house, and there shews him
               that treasure, be it wife, or mistress, or daughter, or what not, that
               he holds most dear; assuring him that yet more gladly, were it
               possible, he would shew him his heart. Which custom I am minded
               to observe here in <span class="place">Bologna</span>.  You, of your courtesy, have honoured
               my feast with your presence, and I propose to do you honour in the
               <span class="place">Persia</span>n fashion, by shewing you that which in all the world I do,
               and must ever, hold most dear. But before I do so, tell me, I pray
               you, how you conceive of a nice question that I shall lay before you.
               	  Suppose that one has in his house a good and most faithful servant,
               who falls sick of a grievous disorder; and that the master tarries not
               for the death of the servant, but has him borne out into the open
               street, and concerns himself no more with him: that then a stranger
               comes by, is moved to pity of the sick man, and takes him to his
               house, and by careful tendance and at no small cost restores him to
               his wonted health.  Now I would fain know whether the first
               master has in equity any just cause to complain of or be aggrieved
               with the second master, if he retain the servant in his employ, and
               refuse to restore him, when so required.
            </p>
            <p>The gentlemen discussed the matter after divers fashions, and
               all agreed in one sentence, which they committed to Niccoluccio
               Caccianimico, for that he was an eloquent and accomplished speaker,
               to deliver on the part of them all.  Niccoluccio began by commending
               the <span class="place">Persia</span>n custom: after which he said that he and the others were
               all of the same opinion, to wit, that the first master had no longer
               any right in his servant, since he had not only abandoned but cast
               him forth; and that by virtue of the second master's kind usage of
               him he must be deemed to have become his servant; wherefore, by
               keeping him, he did the first master no mischief, no violence, no
               wrong. Whereupon the rest that were at the table said, one and all,
               being worthy men, that their judgment jumped with Niccoluccio's
               answer.  The knight, well pleased with the answer, and that 'twas
               Niccoluccio that gave it, affirmed that he was of the same opinion;
               adding: 'Tis now time that I shew you that honour which I
               promised you. He then called two of his servants, and sent them
               to the lady, whom he had caused to be apparelled and adorned with
               splendour, charging them to pray her to be pleased to come and
               gladden the gentlemen with her presence.  So she, bearing in her
               arms her most lovely little son, came, attended by the two servants,
               into the saloon, and by the knight's direction, took a seat beside a
               worthy gentleman: whereupon: Gentlemen, quoth the knight,
               this is the treasure that I hold, and mean ever to hold, more dear
               than aught else. Behold, and judge whether I have good cause.
            </p>
            <p>The gentlemen said not a little in her honour and praise, averring
               that the knight ought indeed to hold her dear: then, as they
               regarded her more attentively, there were not a few that would have
               pronounced her to be the very woman that she was, had they not
               believed that woman to be dead. But none scanned her so closely as
               Niccoluccio, who, the knight being withdrawn a little space, could
               no longer refrain his eager desire to know who she might be, but
               asked her whether she were of <span class="place">Bologna</span>, or from other parts.  The
               lady, hearing her husband's voice, could scarce forbear to answer;
               but yet, not to disconcert the knight's plan, she kept silence.
               Another asked her if that was her little boy; and yet another, if she
               were Messer Gentile's wife, or in any other wise his connection. To
               none of whom she vouchsafed an answer.  Then, Messer Gentile
               coming up: Sir, quoth one of the guests, this treasure of
               yours is goodly indeed; but she seems to be dumb: is she so?
                Gentlemen, quoth Messer Gentile, that she has not as yet
               spoken is no small evidence of her virtue.  Then tell us, you, who she
               is, returned the other.  That, quoth the knight, will I right
               gladly, so you but promise me, that, no matter what I may say, none
               of you will stir from his place, until I have ended my story.  All
               gave the required promise, and when the tables had been cleared,
               Messer Gentile, being seated beside the lady, thus spoke:
               Gentlemen, this lady is that loyal and faithful servant, touching
               whom a brief while ago I propounded to you my question, whom her
               own folk held none too dear, but cast out into the open street as a
               thing vile and no longer good for aught, but I took thence, and by
               my careful tendance wrested from the clutch of death; whom God,
               regardful of my good will, has changed from the appalling aspect of
               a corpse to the thing of beauty that you see before you.  But for
               your fuller understanding of this occurrence, I will briefly explain it
               to you.  He then recounted to them in detail all that had happened
               from his first becoming enamoured of the lady to that very hour;
               whereto they hearkened with no small wonder; after which:
               And so, he added, unless you, and more especially Niccoluccio,
               are now of another opinion than you were a brief while ago, the
               lady rightly belongs to me, nor can any man lawfully reclaim her
               of me.
            </p>
            <p>None answered, for all were intent to hear what more he would
               say. But, while Niccoluccio, and some others that were there, wept
               for sympathy, Messer Gentile stood up, and took the little boy in his
               arms and the lady by the hand, and approached Niccoluccio, saying:
               Rise, my gossip: I do not, indeed, restore thee thy wife, whom thy
               kinsfolk and hers cast forth; but I am minded to give thee this lady,
               my gossip, with this her little boy, whom I know well to be thy son,
               and whom I held at the font, and named Gentile:  and I pray thee that
               she be not the less dear to thee for that she has tarried three months
               in my house; for I swear to thee by that God, who, peradventure,
               ordained that I should be enamoured of her, to the end that my love
               might be, as it has been, the occasion of her restoration to life, that
               never with her father, or her mother, or with thee, did she live more
               virtuously than with my mother in my house.  Which said, he
               turned to the lady, saying: Madam, I now release you from all
               promises made to me, and so deliver you to Niccoluccio. Then,
               leaving the lady and the child in Niccoluccio's embrace, he returned
               to his seat.
            </p>
            <p>Thus to receive his wife and son was to Niccoluccio a delight
               great in the measure of its remoteness from his hope. Wherefore in
               the most honourable terms at his command he thanked the knight,
               whom all the rest, weeping for sympathy, greatly commended for
               what he had done, as did also all that heard thereof.  The lady,
               welcomed home with wondrous cheer, was long a portent to the
               Bolognese, who gazed on her as on one raised from the dead.
               Messer Gentile lived ever after as the friend of Niccoluccio, and his
               and the lady's kinsfolk.
            </p>
            <p>Now what shall be your verdict, gracious ladies? A king's largess,
               though it was of his sceptre and crown, an abbot's reconciliation,
               at no cost to himself, of a malefactor with the Pope, or an old man's
               submission of his throat to the knife of his enemy--will you adjudge
               that such acts as these are comparable to the deed of Messer Gentile?
               Who, though young, and burning with passion, and deeming himself
               justly entitled to that which the heedlessness of another had discarded,
               and he by good fortune had recovered, not only tempered his ardour
               with honour, but having that which with his whole soul he had long
               been bent on wresting from another, did with liberality restore it.
               Assuredly none of the feats aforesaid seem to me like unto this.

               <p>Delicate my ladies, none can justly say that 'twas
                  not magnificently done of Messer Gentile; but if it be alleged that
                  'twas the last degree of magnificence, 'twill perchance not be
                  difficult to shew that more was possible, as is my purpose in the little
                  story that I shall tell you.
               </p>
            </div>
            <p>In <span class="place">Friuli</span>, a country which, though its air is shrewd, is pleasantly
               diversified by fine mountains and not a few rivers and clear
               fountains, is a city called <span class="place">Udine</span>, where dwelt of yore a fair and
               noble lady, Madonna Dianora by name, wife of a wealthy grandee
               named Giliberto, a very pleasant gentleman, and debonair. Now
               this lady, for her high qualities, was in the last degree beloved by
               a great and noble baron, Messer Ansaldo Gradense by name, a
               man of no little consequence, and whose fame for feats of arms and
               courtesy was spread far and wide.  But, though with all a lover's
               ardour he left nought undone that he might do to win her love, and
               to that end frequently plied her with his ambassages, 'twas all in
               vain. And the lady being distressed by his importunity, and chat,
               refuse as she might all that he asked of her, he none the less
               continued to love her and press his suit upon her, bethought her how
               she might rid herself of him by requiring of him an extraordinary
               and, as she deemed, impossible feat.  So one day, a woman that came
               oftentimes from him to her being with her: Good woman,
               quoth she, thou hast many a time affirmed that Messer Ansaldo
               loves me above all else; and thou hast made proffer to me on his
               part of wondrous rich gifts which I am minded he keep to himself,
               for that I could never bring myself to love him or pleasure him for
               their sake; but, if I might be certified that he loves me as
               much as thou sayst, then without a doubt I should not fail to love
               him, and do his pleasure; wherefore, so he give me the assurance
               that I shall require, I shall be at his command.  What is it,
               Madam, returned the good woman, that you would have him do?
               This, replied the lady; I would have this next ensuing January,
               hard by this city, a garden full of green grass and flowers and
               flowering trees, just as if it were May; and if he cannot provide me
               with this garden, bid him never again send either thee or any other
               to me, for that, should he harass me any further, I shall no longer
               keep silence, as I have hitherto done, but shall make my complaint
               to my husband and all my kinsmen, and it shall go hard but I will be
               quit of him.
            </p>
            <p>The gentleman being apprised of his lady's stipulation and
               promise, notwithstanding that he deemed it no easy matter, nay, a
               thing almost impossible, to satisfy her, and knew besides that 'twas
               but to deprive him of all hope that she made the demand, did nevertheless
               resolve to do his endeavour to comply with it, and causing
               search to be made in divers parts of the world, if any he might find
               to afford him counsel or aid, he lit upon one, who for a substantial
               reward offered to do the thing by necromancy.  So Messer Ansaldo,
               having struck the bargain with him for an exceeding great sum of
               money, gleefully expected the appointed time. Which being come
               with extreme cold, insomuch that there was nought but snow and
               ice, the adept on the night before the calends of January wrought
               with his spells to such purpose that on the morrow, as was averred by
               eye-witnesses, there appeared in a meadow hard by the city one of
               the most beautiful gardens that was ever seen, with no lack of grass
               and trees and fruits of all sorts.  At sight whereof Messer Ansaldo
               was overjoyed, and caused some of the finest fruits and flowers that
               it contained to be gathered, and privily presented to his lady, whom
               he bade come and see the garden that she had craved, that thereby
               she might have assurance of his love, and mind her of the promise
               that she had given him and confirmed with an oath, and, as a loyal
               lady, take thought for its performance.  When she saw the flowers
               and fruits, the lady, who had already heard not a few folk speak of
               the wondrous garden, began to repent her of her promise. But for
               all that, being fond of strange sights, she hied her with many other
               ladies of the city to see the garden, and having gazed on it with
               wonderment, and commended it not a little, she went home the
               saddest woman alive, bethinking her to what it bound her:  and so
               great was her distress that she might not well conceal it; but, being
               written on her face, 'twas marked by her husband, who was minded
               by all means to know the cause thereof.
            </p>
            <p>The lady long time kept silence: but at last she yielded to his
               urgency, and discovered to him the whole matter from first to last.
               Whereat Giliberto was at first very wroth; but on second thoughts,
               considering the purity of the lady's purpose, he was better advised,
               and dismissing his anger: Dianora, quoth he, 'tis not the act
               of a discreet or virtuous lady to give ear to messages of such a sort,
               nor to enter into any compact touching her chastity with any man
               on any terms. Words that the ears convey to the heart have a
               potency greater than is commonly supposed, and there is scarce
               aught that lovers will not find possible.  'Twas then ill done of thee
               in the first instance to hearken, as afterwards to make the compact;
               but, for that I know the purity of thy soul, that thou mayst be quit
               of thy promise, I will grant thee that which, perchance, no other man
               would grant, being also swayed thereto by fear of the necromancer,
               whom Messer Ansaldo, shouldst thou play him false, might, peradventure,
               cause to do us a mischief.  I am minded, then, that thou
               go to him, and contrive, if on any wise thou canst, to get thee quit of
               this promise without loss of virtue; but if otherwise it may not be,
               then for the nonce thou mayst yield him thy body, but not thy soul.
               Whereat the lady, weeping, would none of such a favour at her
               husband's hands. But Giliberto, for all the lady's protestations, was
               minded that so it should be.
            </p>
            <p>Accordingly, on the morrow about dawn, apparelled none too
               ornately, preceded by two servants and followed by a chambermaid,
               the lady hied her to Messer Ansaldo's house.  Apprised that his lady
               was come to see him, Messer Ansaldo, marvelling not a little, rose,
               and having called the necromancer: I am minded, quoth he,
               that thou see what goodly gain I have gotten by thine art. And
               the twain having met the lady, Ansaldo gave way to no unruly
               appetite, but received her with a seemly obeisance; and then the
               three repaired to a goodly chamber, where there was a great fire, and
               having caused the lady to be seated, thus spoke Ansaldo:  Madam,
               if the love that I have so long borne you merit any guerdon, I pray
               you that it be not grievous to you to discover to me the true occasion
               of your coming to me at this hour, and thus accompanied.  Shamefast,
               and the tears all but standing in her eyes, the lady made
               answer: Sir, 'tis neither love that I bear you, nor faith that I
               pledged you, that brings me hither, but the command of my husband,
               who, regarding rather the pains you have had of your unbridled
               passion than his own or my honour, has sent me hither; and for that
               he commands it, I, for the nonce, am entirely at your pleasure.
            </p>
            <p>If Messer Ansaldo had marvelled to hear of the lady's coming,
               he now marvelled much more, and touched by Giliberto's liberality,
               and passing from passion to compassion:  Now, God forbid,
               Madam, quoth he, that, it being as you say, I should wound the
               honour of him that has compassion on my love; wherefore, no
               otherwise than as if you were my sister shall you abide here, while
               you are so minded, and be free to depart at your pleasure; nor crave
               I aught of you but that you shall convey from me to your husband
               such thanks as you shall deem meet for courtesy such as his has been,
               and entreat me ever henceforth as your brother and servant.
               Whereat overjoyed in the last degree: Nought, quoth the lady,
               by what I noted of your behaviour, could ever have caused me to
               anticipate other sequel of my coming hither than this which I see is
               your will, and for which I shall ever be your debtor. She then
               took her leave, and, attended by a guard of honour, returned to
               Giliberto, and told him what had passed; between whom and Messer
               Ansaldo there was thenceforth a most close and loyal friendship.
            </p>
            <p>Now the liberality shewn by Giliberto towards Messer Ansaldo,
               and by Messer Ansaldo towards the lady, having been marked by
               the necromancer, when Messer Ansaldo made ready to give him the
               promised reward: Now God forbid, quoth he, that, as I have
               seen Giliberto liberal in regard of his honour, and you liberal in
               regard of your love, I be not in like manner liberal in regard of my
               reward, which accordingly, witting that 'tis in good hands, I am
               minded that you keep.  The knight was abashed, and strove hard
               to induce him to take, if not the whole, at least a part of the money;
               but finding that his labour was in vain, and that the necromancer,
               having caused his garden to vanish after the third day, was minded
               to depart, he bade him adieu. And the carnal love he had borne
               the lady being spent, he burned for her thereafter with a flame of
               honourable affection.  Now what shall be our verdict in this case,
               lovesome ladies? A lady, as it were dead, and a love grown lukewarm
               for utter hopelessness! Shall we set a liberality shewn in such
               a case above this liberality of Messer Ansaldo, loving yet as ardently,
               and hoping, perchance, yet more ardently than ever, and holding
               in his hands the prize that he had so long pursued? Folly indeed
               should I deem it to compare that liberality with this.

            <div class="frame">
               <p>Illustrious my
                  ladies, I have ever been of opinion that in companies like ours one
                  should speak so explicitly that the import of what is said should
                  never by excessive circumscription afford matter for disputation;
                  which is much more in place among students in the schools, than
                  among us, whose powers are scarce adequate to the management of
                  the distaff and the spindle.  Wherefore I, that had in mind a matter
                  of, perchance, some nicety, now that I see you all at variance
                  touching the matters last mooted, am minded to lay it aside, and
                  tell you somewhat else, which concerns a man by no means of slight
                  account, but a valiant king, being a chivalrous action that he did,
                  albeit in no wise thereto actuated by his honour.
               </p>
            </div>
            <p>There is none of you but may not seldom have heard tell of King
               Charles the Old, or the First, by whose magnificent emprise, and the
               ensuing victory gained over King Manfred, the Ghibellines were driven
               forth of <span class="place">Florence</span>, and the Guelfs returned thither. For which cause a
               knight, Messer Neri degli Uberti by name, departing <span class="place">Florence</span> with
               his household and not a little money, resolved to fix his abode under
               no
               other sway than that of King Charles.  And being fain of a lonely
               place in which to end his days in peace, he betook him to <span class="place">Castello
                  da Mare di Stabia</span>; and there, perchance a cross-bow-shot from the
               other houses of the place, amid the olives and hazels and chestnuts
               that abound in those parts, he bought an estate, on which he built a
               goodly house and commodious, with a pleasant garden beside it, in the
               midst of which, having no lack of running water, he set, after our
               Florentine fashion, a pond fair and clear, and speedily filled it with
               fish.  And while thus he lived, daily occupying himself with nought
               else but how to make his garden more fair, it befell that King
               Charles in the hot season betook him to Castello da Mare to refresh
               himself a while, and hearing of the beauty of Messer Neri's garden,
               was desirous to view it. And having learned to whom it belonged,
               he bethought him that, as the knight was an adherent of the party
               opposed to him, he would use more familiarity towards him than he
               would otherwise have done; and so he sent him word that he and
               four comrades would sup privily with him in his garden on the
               ensuing evening.  Messer Neri felt himself much honoured; and
               having made his preparations with magnificence, and arranged the
               order of the ceremonies with his household, did all he could and
               knew to make the King cordially welcome to his fair garden.
            </p>
            <p>When the King had viewed the garden throughout, as also Messer
               Neri's house, and commended them, he washed, and seated himself at
               one of the tables, which were set beside the pond, and bade Count
               Guy de Montfort, who was one of his companions, sit on one side
               of him, and Messer Neri on the other, and the other three to
               serve, as they should be directed by Messer Neri.  The dishes that
               were set before them were dainty, the wines excellent and rare, the
               order of the repast very fair and commendable, without the least
               noise or aught else that might distress; whereon the King bestowed
               no stinted praise.  As thus he gaily supped, well-pleased with the
               lovely spot, there came into the garden two young maidens, each
               perhaps fifteen years old, blonde both, their golden tresses falling all
               in ringlets about them, and crowned with a dainty garland of
               periwinkle-flowers; and so delicate and fair of face were they that
               they shewed liker to angels than aught else, each clad in a robe of
               finest linen, white as snow upon their flesh, close-fitting as might be
               from the waist up, but below the waist ample, like a pavilion to the
               feet.  She that was foremost bore on her shoulders a pair of nets,
               which she held with her left hand, carrying in her right a long pole.
               Her companion followed, bearing on her left shoulder a frying-pan,
               under her left arm a bundle of faggots, and in her left hand a tripod,
               while in the other hand she carried a cruse of oil and a lighted taper.
               At sight of whom the King marvelled, and gazed intent to learn
               what it might import.  The two young maidens came forward with
               becoming modesty, and did obeisance to the King; which done they
               hied them to the place of ingress to the pond, and she that had the
               frying-pan, having set it down, and afterward the other things, took
               the pole that the other carried, and so they both went down into the
               pond, being covered by its waters to their breasts.  Whereupon one
               of Messer Neri's servants, having forthwith lit a fire, and set the tripod
               on the faggots and oil therein, addressed himself to wait, until some
               fish should be thrown to him by the girls.  Who, the one searching
               with the pole in those parts where she knew the fish lay hid, while
               the other made ready the nets, did in a brief space of time, to the
               exceeding great delight of the King, who watched them attentively,
               catch fish not a few, which they tossed to the servant, who set them,
               before the life was well out of them, in the frying-pan. After
               which, the maidens, as pre-arranged, addressed them to catch some
               of the finest fish, and cast them on to the table before the King, and
               Count Guy, and their father.  The fish wriggled about the table to
               the prodigious delight of the King, who in like manner took some
               of them, and courteously returned them to the girls; with which
               sport they diverted them, until the servant had cooked the fish that
               had been given him: which, by Messer Neri's command, were set
               before the King rather as a side-dish than as aught very rare or
               delicious.
            </p>
            <p>When the girls saw that all the fish were cooked, and that there
               was no occasion for them to catch any more, they came forth of the
               pond, their fine white garments cleaving everywhere close to their
               flesh so as to hide scarce any part of their delicate persons, took up
               again the things that they had brought, and passing modestly before
               the King, returned to the house.  The King, and the Count, and
               the other gentlemen that waited, had regarded the maidens with no
               little attention, and had, one and all, inly bestowed on them no little
               praise, as being fair and shapely, and therewithal sweet and debonair;
               but 'twas in the King's eyes that they especially found favour.
               Indeed, as they came forth of the water, the King had scanned each
               part of their bodies so intently that, had one then pricked him, he
               would not have felt it,  and his thoughts afterwards dwelling upon
               them, though he knew not who they were, nor how they came to
               be there, he felt stir within his heart a most ardent desire to pleasure
               them, whereby he knew very well that, if he took not care, he
               would grow enamoured; howbeit he knew not whether of the
               twain pleased him the more, so like was each to the other.  Having
               thus brooded a while, he turned to Messer Neri, and asked who the
               two damsels were. Whereto: Sire, replied Messer Neri, they
               are my twin daughters, and they are called, the one, Ginevra the Fair,
               and the other, Isotta the Blonde. Whereupon the King was loud
               in praise of them, and exhorted Messer Neri to bestow them in
               marriage. To which Messer Neri demurred, for that he no longer
               had the means.  And nought of the supper now remaining to serve,
               save the fruit, in came the two young damsels in gowns of taffeta
               very fine, bearing in their hands two vast silver salvers full of divers
               fruits, such as the season yielded, and set them on the table before
               the King.  Which done, they withdrew a little space and fell a
               singing to music a ditty, of which the opening words were as
               follows:
            </p>
            <p> Love, many words would not suffice
               There where I am come to tell.
            </p>
            <p>And so dulcet and delightsome was the strain that to the King,
               his eyes and ears alike charmed, it seemed as if all the nine orders
               of angels were descended there to sing. The song ended, they
               knelt and respectfully craved the King's leave to depart; which,
               though sorely against his will, he gave them with a forced gaiety.
            </p>
            <p>Supper ended, the King and his companions, having remounted
               their horses, took leave of Messer Neri, and conversing of divers
               matters, returned to the royal quarters;  where the King, still harbouring
               his secret passion, nor, despite affairs of state that supervened,
               being able to forget the beauty and sweetness of Ginevra the Fair,
               for whose sake he likewise loved her twin sister, was so limed by
               Love that he could scarce think of aught else. So, feigning other
               reasons, he consorted familiarly with Messer Neri, and did much
               frequent his garden, that he might see Ginevra.  And at length,
               being unable to endure his suffering any longer, and being minded,
               for that he could devise no other expedient, to despoil their father not
               only of the one but of the other damsel also, he discovered both his
               love and his project to Count Guy;  who, being a good man and true,
               thus made answer: Sire, your tale causes me not a little astonishment,
               and that more especially because of your conversation from
               your childhood to this very day, I have, methinks, known more than
               any other man.  And as no such passion did I ever mark in you,
               even in your youth, when Love should more readily have fixed you
               with his fangs, as now I discern, when you are already on the
               verge of old age, 'tis to me so strange, so surprising that you
               should veritably love, that I deem it little short of a miracle.  And
               were it meet for me to reprove you, well wot I the language I should
               hold to you, considering that you are yet in arms in a realm but
               lately won, among a people as yet unknown to you, and wily and
               treacherous in the extreme, and that the gravest anxieties and
               matters of high policy engross your mind, so that you are not
               as yet able to sit you down, and nevertheless amid all these weighty
               concerns you have given harbourage to false, flattering Love.  This
               is not the wisdom of a great king, but the folly of a feather-pated
               boy. And moreover, what is far worse, you say that you are
               resolved to despoil this poor knight of his two daughters, whom,
               entertaining you in his house, and honouring you to the best of his
               power, he brought into your presence all but naked, testifying
               thereby, how great is his faith in you, and how assured he is that
               you are a king, and not a devouring wolf.  Have you so soon forgotten
               that 'twas Manfred's outrageous usage of his subjects that
               opened you the way into this realm? What treachery was he ever
               guilty of that better merited eternal torment, than 'twould be in you
               to wrest from one that honourably entreats you at once his hope and
               his consolation? What would be said of you if so you should do?
               Perchance you deem that 'twould suffice to say: 'I did it because
               he is a Ghibelline.' Is it then consistent with the justice of a king
               that those, be they who they may, who seek his protection, as this
               man has sought yours, should be entreated after this sort?  King, I
               bid you remember that exceeding great as is your glory to have
               vanquished Manfred, yet to conquer oneself is a still greater glory:
               wherefore you, to whom belongs the correction of others, see to it
               that you conquer yourself, and refrain this unruly passion; and let
               not such a blot mar the splendour of your achievements.
            </p>
            <p>Sore stricken at heart by the Count's words, and the more
               mortified that he acknowledged their truth, the King heaved a
               fervent sigh or two, and then: Count, quoth he, that enemy
               there is none, however mighty, but to the practised warrior is weak
               enough and easy to conquer in comparison of his own appetite, I
               make no doubt; but, great though the struggle will be and immeasurable
               the force that it demands, so shrewdly galled am I by
               your words, that not many days will have gone by before I shall
               without fail have done enough to shew you that I, that am the
               conqueror of others, am no less able to gain the victory over myself.
               And indeed but a few days thereafter, the King, on his return to
               <span class="place">Naples</span>, being minded at once to leave himself no excuse for dishonourable
               conduct, and to recompense the knight for his honourable
               entreatment of him, did, albeit 'twas hard for him to endow
               another with that which he had most ardently desired for himself,
               none the less resolve to bestow the two damsels in marriage, and that
               not as Messer Neri's daughters, but as his own.  Wherefore, Messer
               Neri consenting, he provided both with magnificent dowries, and
               gave Ginevra the Fair to Messer Maffeo da Palizzi, and Isotta the
               Blonde to Messer Guglielmo della Magna, noble knights and great
               barons both; which done, sad at heart beyond measure, he betook
               him to <span class="place">Apulia</span>, and by incessant travail did so mortify his vehement
               appetite that he snapped and broke in pieces the fetters of Love, and
               for the rest of his days was no more vexed by such passion.
            </p>
            <p>Perchance there will be those who say that 'tis but a trifle for
               a king to bestow two girls in marriage; nor shall I dispute it: but
               say we that a king in love bestowed in marriage her whom he loved,
               neither having taken nor taking, of his love, leaf or flower or fruit;
               then this I say was a feat great indeed, nay, as great as might be.
            </p>
            <p>After such a sort then did this magnificent King, at once
               generously rewarding the noble knight, commendably honouring
               the damsels that he loved, and stoutly subduing himself.

                  of his adversaries, I am minded to recount the same to you.
               </p>
            </div>
            <p>What time the French were driven forth of <span class="place">Sicily</span> there dwelt
               at <span class="place">Palermo</span> one of our Florentines, that was an apothecary, Bernardo
               Puccini by name, a man of great wealth, that by his lady had an
               only and exceeding fair daughter, then of marriageable age.  Now
               King Pedro of Arragon, being instated in the sovereignty of the
               island, did at <span class="place">Palermo</span> make with his barons marvellous celebration
               thereof; during which, as he tilted after the Catalan fashion, it
               befell that Bernardo's daughter, Lisa by name, being with other
               ladies at a window, did thence espy him in the course, whereat being
               prodigiously delighted, she regarded him again and again, and grew
               fervently enamoured of him;  nor yet, when the festivities were
               ended, and she was at home with her father, was there aught she
               could think of but this her exalted and aspiring love. In regard
               whereof that which most irked her was her sense of her low rank,
               which scarce permitted her any hope of a happy issue; but, for all
               that, give over her love for the King she would not; nor yet, for
               fear of worse to come, dared she discover it.  The King, meanwhile,
               recking, witting nothing of the matter, her suffering waxed immeasurable,
               intolerable;  and her love ever growing with ever fresh
               accessions of melancholy, the fair maiden, overborne at last, fell sick,
               and visibly day by day wasted like snow in sunlight.  Distraught
               with grief thereat, her father and mother afforded her such succour
               as they might with words of good cheer, and counsel of physicians,
               and physic; but all to no purpose; for that she in despair of her
               love was resolved no more to live.
            </p>
            <p>Now her father assuring her that there was no whim of hers but
               should be gratified, the fancy took her that, if she might find apt
               means, she would, before she died, make her love and her resolve
               known to the King: wherefore one day she besought her father to
               cause Minuccio d'<span class="place">Arezzo</span> to come to her;  which Minuccio was a
               singer and musician of those days, reputed most skilful, and well seen
               of King Pedro. Bernardo, deeming that Lisa desired but to hear
               him play and sing a while, conveyed her message to him; and he,
               being an agreeable fellow, came to her forthwith, and after giving her
               some words of loving cheer, sweetly discoursed some airs upon his
               viol, and then sang her some songs; whereby, while he thought to
               comfort her, he did but add fire and flame to her love.  Presently
               the girl said that she would fain say a few words to him in private,
               and when all else were withdrawn from the chamber: Minuccio,
               quoth she, thee have I chosen, deeming thee most trusty, to be the
               keeper of my secret, relying upon thee in the first place never to
               betray it to a soul, and next to lend me in regard thereof such aid as
               thou mayst be able; and so I pray thee to do.  Thou must know,
               then, Minuccio mine, that on the day when our lord King Pedro
               held the great festival in celebration of his triumph, I, seeing him
               tilt, was so smitten with love of him that thereof was kindled within
               my soul the fire which has brought me, as thou seest, to this pass;
               and knowing how ill it beseems me to love a king, and being unable,
               I say not to banish it from my heart, but so much as to bring it
               within bounds, and finding it exceeding grievous to bear, I have
               made choice of death as the lesser pain; and die I shall.  But should
               he wot not of my love before I die, sore disconsolate should I depart;
               and knowing not by whom more aptly than by thee I might give
               him to know this my frame, I am minded to entrust the communication
               thereof to thee; which office I entreat thee not to refuse, and
               having discharged it, to let me know, that dying thus consoled, I may
               depart this pain. Which said, she silently wept.
            </p>
            <p>Marvelling at the loftiness of the girl's spirit and her desperate
               determination, Minuccio commiserated her not a little; and presently
               it occurred to him that there was a way in which he might honourably
               serve her: wherefore:  Lisa, quoth he, my faith I plight
               thee, wherein thou mayst place sure confidence that I shall never
               play thee false, and lauding thy high emprise, to wit, the setting thine
               affections upon so great a king, I proffer thee mine aid, whereby,
               so thou wilt be of good cheer, I hope, and believe, that, before thou
               shalt see the third day from now go by, I shall have brought thee
               tidings which will be to thee for an exceeding great joy; and, not
               to lose time, I will set to work at once.  And so Lisa, assuring
               him that she would be of good cheer, and plying him afresh with
               instant obsecrations, bade him Godspeed;  and Minuccio, having
               taken leave of her, hied him to one Mico da <span class="place">Siena</span>, a very expert
               rhymester of those days, who at his instant request made the ensuing
               song:

            <div class="song">Hence hie thee, Love; and hasting to my King,

               Still close, for fear, my passion harbouring.Lo, Love, to thee with claspèd hands I turn,
               And pray thee seek him where he tarrieth,
               And tell him how I oft for him do yearn,
               So sweetly he my heart enamoureth;
               And of the fire, wherewith I throughly burn,
               I think to die, but may the hour uneath
               Say, when my grievous pain shall with my breath
               Surcease; till when, neither may fear nor shame
               The least abate the flame.
               Ah! to his ears my woeful story bring.Since of him I was first enamourèd,
               Never hast thou, O Love, my fearful heart
               With any such fond hope encouragèd,
               As e'er its message to him to impart,
               To him, my lord, that me so sore bested
               Holds: dying thus, 'twere grievous to depart:
               Perchance, were he to know my cruel smart,
               'Twould not displease him; might I but make bold
               My soul to him to unfold,
               And shew him all my woeful languishing.Love, since 'twas not thy will me to accord
               Such boldness as that e'er unto my King
               I may discover my sad heart's full hoard,
               Or any word or sign thereof him bring:
               This all my prayer to thee, O sweet my Lord:
               Hie thee to him, and so him whispering
               Mind of the day I saw him tourneying
               With all his paladins environèd,
               And grew enamourèd
               Ev'n to my very heart's disrupturing.

            <p>Which words Minuccio forthwith set to music after a soft and
               plaintive fashion befitting their sense; and on the third day thereafter
               hied him to court, while King Pedro was yet at breakfast.
               And being bidden by the King to sing something to the accompaniment
               of his viol,  he gave them this song with such sweet concord of
               words and music that all the folk that were in the King's hall seemed,
               as it were, entranced, so intent and absorbed stood they to listen,
               and the King rather more than the rest.  And when Minuccio had
               done singing, the King asked whence the song came, that, as far as
               he knew, he had never heard it before.  Sire, replied Minuccio,
               'tis not yet three days since 'twas made, words and music alike.
               And being asked by the King in regard of whom 'twas made:
               I dare not, quoth he, discover such a secret save to you
               alone.
               Bent on hearing the story, the King, when the tables were cleared,
               took Minuccio into his privy chamber; and there Minuccio told
               him everything exactly as he had heard it from Lisa's lips. Whereby
               the King was much gratified, and lauded the maiden not a little, and
               said that a girl of such high spirit merited considerate treatment, and
               bade Minuccio be his envoy to her, and comfort her, and tell her
               that without fail that very day at vespers he would come to visit her.
               Overjoyed to bear the girl such gladsome tidings, Minuccio tarried
               not, but hied him back to the girl with his viol, and being closeted
               with her, told her all that had passed, and then sang the song to the
               accompaniment of his viol.  Whereby the girl was so cheered and
               delighted that forthwith there appeared most marked and manifest
               signs of the amendment of her health, while with passionate longing
               (albeit none in the house knew or divined it) she awaited the vesper
               hour, when she was to see her lord.
            </p>
            <p>Knowing the girl very well, and how fair she was, and pondering
               divers times on what Minuccio had told him, the King, being a prince
               of a liberal and kindly disposition, grew ever more compassionate.
               So, about vespers, he mounted his horse, and rode forth, as if for
               mere pleasure, and being come to the apothecary's house, demanded
               access to a very goodly garden that the apothecary had, and having
               dismounted, after a while enquired of Bernardo touching his
               daughter, and whether he had yet bestowed her in marriage.  Sire,
               replied Bernardo, she is not yet married; and indeed she has been
               and still is very ill: howbeit since none she is wonderfully amended.
               The significance of which amendment being forthwith apprehended
               by the King: In good faith, quoth he, 'twere a pity so fair
               a creature were reft from the world so early; we would go in and
               visit her.  And presently, attended only by two of his lords and
               Bernardo, he betook him to her chamber, where being entered,
               he drew nigh the bed, whereon the girl half reclined, half sate in
               eager expectation of his coming; and taking her by the hand:
               Madonna, quoth he, what means this? A maiden like you
               should be the comfort of others, and you suffer yourself to languish.
               We would entreat you that for love of us you be of good cheer, so
               as speedily to recover your health.  To feel the touch of his hand
               whom she loved above all else, the girl, albeit somewhat shamefast,
               was so enraptured that 'twas as if she was in Paradise; and as soon
               as she was able: My lord, she said, 'twas the endeavour, weak
               as I am, to sustain a most grievous burden that brought this sickness
               upon me; but 'twill not be long ere you will see me quit thereof,
               thanks to your courtesy.  The hidden meaning of which words
               was apprehended only by the King, who momently made more
               account of the girl, and again and again inly cursed Fortune, that had
               decreed that she should be the daughter of such a man. And yet a
               while he tarried with her, and comforted her, and so took his leave.
               Which gracious behaviour of the King was not a little commended,
               and accounted a signal honour to the apothecary and his daughter.
            </p>
            <p>The girl, glad at heart as was ever lady of her lover, mended
               with reviving hope, and in a few days recovered her health, and
               therewith more than all her wonted beauty.  Whereupon the King,
               having taken counsel with the Queen how to reward so great a love,
               got him one day to horse with a great company of his barons, and
               hied him to the apothecary's house; and being come into the garden,
               he sent for the apothecary and his daughter; and there, being joined
               by the Queen with not a few ladies, who received the girl into their
               company, they made such cheer as 'twas a wonder to see.  And
               after a while the King and Queen having called Lisa to them, quoth
               the King: Honourable damsel, by the great love that you have
               borne us we are moved greatly to honour you; and we trust that,
               for love of us, the honour that we design for you will be acceptable
               to you. Now 'tis thus we would honour you: to wit, that, seeing
               that you are of marriageable age, we would have you take for
               husband him that we shall give you; albeit 'tis none the less our
               purpose ever to call ourself your knight, demanding no other tribute
               of all your love but one sole kiss.  Scarlet from brow to neck,
               the girl, making the King's pleasure her own, thus with a low
               voice replied: My lord, very sure am I that, should it come to
               be known that I was grown enamoured of you, most folk would hold
               me for a fool, deeming, perchance, that I was out of my mind, and
               witless alike of my own rank and yours;  but God, who alone reads
               the hearts of us mortals, knows that even then, when first I did
               affect you, I wist that you were the King, and I but the daughter of
               Bernardo the apothecary, and that to suffer my passion to soar so
               high did ill become me;  but, as you know far better than I, none
               loves of set and discreet purpose, but only according to the dictates
               of impulse and fancy; which law my forces, albeit not seldom
               opposed, being powerless to withstand, I loved and still love and
               shall ever love you.  But as no sooner knew I myself subjugated to
               your love, than I vowed to have ever no will but yours; therefore not
               only am I compliant to take right gladly him whom you shall be
               pleased to give me for husband, thereby conferring upon me great
               honour and dignity; but if you should bid me tarry in the fire,
               delighted were I to obey, so thereby I might pleasure you.  How
               far it beseems me to have you, my King, for my knight, you best
               know; and therefore I say nought thereof; nor will the kiss which
               you crave as your sole tribute of my love be granted you save by
               leave of my Lady the Queen.  Natheless, may you have of this
               great graciousness that you and my Lady the Queen have shewn
               me, and which I may not requite, abundant recompense in the blessing
               and favour of God; and so she was silent.
            </p>
            <p>The Queen was mightily delighted with the girl's answer, and
               deemed her as discreet as the King had said. The King then sent
               for the girl's father and mother, and being assured that his intention
               had their approval, summoned to his presence a young man, Perdicone
               by name, that was of gentle birth, but in poor circumstances, and
               put certain rings into his hand, and (he nowise gainsaying) wedded
               him to Lisa.  Which done, besides jewels many and precious that
               he and the Queen gave the girl, he forthwith bestowed upon Perdicone
               two domains, right goodly and of ample revenues, to wit,
               Ceffalù and <span class="place">Calatabellotta</span>, saying: We give them to thee for thy
               wife's dowry; what we have in store for thee thou wilt learn hereafter.
               Which said, he turned to the girl, and:  Now, quoth
               he, we are minded to cull that fruit which is due to us of thy
               love; and so, taking her head between both his hands, he kissed her
               brow.  Wherefore, great was the joy of Perdicone, and the father
               and mother of Lisa, and Lisa herself, and mighty the cheer they
               made, and gaily did they celebrate the nuptials. And, as many
               affirm, right well did the King keep his promise to the girl; for that
               ever, while he lived, he called himself her knight, nor went to any
               passage of arms bearing other device than that which he had
               from her.
            </p>
            <p>Now 'tis by doing after this sort that sovereigns win the hearts
               of their subjects, give others occasion of well-doing, and gain for
               themselves an imperishable renown. At which mark few or none in
               our times have bent the bow of their understanding, the more part
               of the princes having become but cruel tyrants.

            <p>Sophronia, albeit she deems herself wife to Gisippus, is
               wife to Titus Zuintius Fulvus, and goes with him to
               <span class="place">Rome</span>, where Gisippus arrives in indigence, and deeming

               slew the man: whereof he that did the deed being
               witness, he discovers himself as the murderer. Whereby
               it comes to pass that they are all three liberated by
               Octavianus; and Titus gives Gisippus his sister to

                  of the king thus began:
               </p>
            </div>
            <p>Magnificent my ladies, who wots not
               that there is nought so great but kings, when they have a mind, may
               accomplish it? As also that 'tis of them that magnificence is most
               especially demanded? Now whoso, being powerful, does that which
               it appertains to him to do, does well; but therein is no such matter of
               marvel, or occasion of extolling him to the skies, as in his deed, of
               whom, for that his power is slight, less is demanded.  Wherefore, as
               you are so profuse of your words in exaltation of the fine deeds, as
               you deem them, of monarchs, I make no manner of doubt, but that the
               doings of our peers must seem to you yet more delectable and commendable,
               when they equal or surpass those of kings. Accordingly
               'tis a transaction, laudable and magnificent, that passed between two
               citizens, who were friends, that I purpose to recount to you in my
               story.
            </p>
            <p>I say, then, that what time Octavianus Caesar, not as yet hight
               Augustus, but being in the office called Triumvirate, swayed the
               empire of <span class="place">Rome</span>, there dwelt at <span class="place">Rome</span> a gentleman, Publius Quintius
               Fulvus by name, who, having a son, Titus Quintius Fulvus, that
               was a very prodigy of wit, sent him to Athens to study philosophy,
               and to the best of his power commended him to a nobleman of that
               city, Chremes by name, who was his very old friend.  Chremes
               lodged Titus in his own house with his son Gisippus, and placed
               both Titus and Gisippus under a philosopher named Aristippus, to
               learn of him his doctrine.  And the two youths, thus keeping
               together, found each the other's conversation so congruous with his
               own, that there grew up between them a friendship so close and
               brotherly that 'twas never broken by aught but death; nor knew
               either rest or solace save when he was with the other.  So, gifted
               alike with pre-eminent subtlety of wit, they entered on their studies,
               and with even pace and prodigious applause scaled together the
               glorious heights of philosophy. In which way of life, to the exceeding
               great delight of Chremes, who entreated Titus as no less his son
               than Gisippus, they continued for full three years.  At the end
               whereof, it befell (after the common course of things mundane) that
               Chremes (being now aged) departed this life. Whom with equal
               grief they mourned as a common father; and the friends and kinsfolk
               of Chremes were alike at a loss to determine whether of the twain
               stood in need of the more consolation upon the bereavement.
            </p>
            <p>Some months afterward the friends and kinsfolk of Gisippus came
               to him and exhorted him, as did also Titus, to take a wife, and found
               him a maiden, wondrous fair, of one of the most noble houses of
               Athens, her name Sophronia, and her age about fifteen years.  So a
               time was appointed for their nuptials, and one day, when 'twas near
               at hand, Gisippus bade Titus come see the maiden, whom as yet he
               had not seen; and they being come into her house, and she sitting
               betwixt them, Titus, as he were fain to observe with care the several
               charms of his friend's wife that was to be, surveyed her with the
               closest attention, and being delighted beyond measure with all that
               he saw, grew, as inly he extolled her charms to the skies, enamoured
               of her with a love as ardent, albeit he gave no sign of it, as ever lover
               bore to lady. However, after they had tarried a while with her,
               they took their leave, and went home,  where Titus repaired to his
               chamber, and there gave himself over to solitary musing on the
               damsel's charms, and the longer he brooded, the more he burned for
               her. Whereon as he reflected, having heaved many a fervent sigh,
               thus he began to commune with himself:  Ah! woe worth thy
               life, Titus! Whom makest thou the mistress of thy soul, thy
               love, thy hope? Knowest thou not that by reason as well of thy
               honourable entreatment by Chremes and his kin as of the whole-hearted
               friendship that is between thee and Gisippus, it behoves thee
               to have his betrothed in even such pious regard as if she were thy
               sister? Whither art thou suffering beguiling love, delusive hope, to
               hurry thee?  Open the eyes of thine understanding, and see thyself,
               wretched man, as thou art; obey the dictates of thy reason, refrain thy
               carnal appetite, control thine inordinate desires, and give thy thoughts
               another bent; join battle with thy lust at the outset, and conquer
               thyself while there is yet time.  This which thou wouldst have is
               not meet, is not seemly: this which thou art minded to ensue, thou
               wouldst rather, though thou wert, as thou art not, sure of its attainment,
               eschew, hadst thou but the respect thou shouldst have, for the
               claims of true friendship. So, then, Titus, what wilt thou do?
               What but abandon this unseemly love, if thou wouldst do as it
               behoves thee?
            </p>
            <p>But then, as he remembered Sophronia, his thoughts took the
               contrary direction, and he recanted all he had said, musing on this
               wise: The laws of Love are of force above all others; they abrogate
               not only the law of human friendship, but the law Divine
               itself. How many times ere now has father loved daughter, brother
               sister, step-mother step-son? aberrations far more notable than that a
               friend should love his friend's wife, which has happened a thousand
               times.  Besides which, I am young, and youth is altogether subject
               to the laws of Love. Love's pleasure, then, should be mine. The
               seemly is for folk of riper years. 'Tis not in my power to will aught
               save that which Love wills.  So beauteous is this damsel that there
               is none but should love her; and if I love her, who am young, who
               can justly censure me? I love her not because she is the affianced
               of Gisippus; no matter whose she was, I should love her all the
               same.  Herein is Fortune to blame, that gave her to my friend,
               Gisippus, rather than to another. And if she is worthy of love, as
               for beauty she is, Gisippus, if he should come to know that I love
               her, ought to be less jealous than another.
            </p>
            <p>Then, scorning himself that he should indulge such thoughts, he
               relapsed into the opposing mood, albeit not to abide there, but ever
               veering to and fro, he spent not only the whole of that day and the
               ensuing night, but many others; insomuch that, being able neither
               to eat nor to sleep, he grew so weak that he was fain to take to his
               bed.  Gisippus, who had marked his moodiness for some days, and
               now saw that he was fairly sick, was much distressed; and with
               sedulous care, never quitting his side, he tended, and strove as best
               he might to comfort, him, not seldom and most earnestly demanding
               to know of him the cause of his melancholy and his sickness. Many
               were the subterfuges to which Titus resorted; but, as Gisippus was
               not to be put off with his fables, finding himself hard pressed by him,
               with sighs and sobs he made answer on this wise:  Gisippus, had
               such been the will of the Gods, I were fain rather to die than to
               live, seeing that Fortune has brought me to a strait in which needs
               must my virtue be put to the ordeal, and, to my most grievous
               shame, 'tis found wanting: whereof I confidently expect my due
               reward, to wit, death, which will be more welcome to me than to
               live, haunted ever by the memory of my baseness, which, as there is
               nought that from thee I either should or can conceal, I, not without
               burning shame, will discover to thee.  And so he recounted the
               whole story from first to last, the occasion of his melancholy, its
               several moods, their conflict, and with which of them the victory
               rested, averring that he was dying of love for Sophronia, and that,
               knowing how ill such love beseemed him, he had, for penance, elected
               to die, and deemed the end was now not far off.  Gisippus, hearing
               his words and seeing his tears, for a while knew not what to say,
               being himself smitten with the damsel's charms, albeit in a less degree
               than Titus; but ere long he made up his mind that Sophronia must
               be less dear to him than his friend's life.
            </p>
            <p>And so, moved to tears by his friend's tears:  Titus, quoth
               he between his sobs, but that thou art in need of comfort, I should
               reproach thee, that thou hast offended against our friendship in that
               thou hast so long kept close from me this most distressful passion;
               and albeit thou didst deem it unseemly, yet unseemly things should
               no more than things seemly be withheld from a friend, for that, as a
               friend rejoices with his friend in things seemly, so he does his endeavour
               to wean his friend from things unseemly: but enough of this
               for the nonce: I pass to that which, I wot, is of greater moment.  If
               thou ardently lovest Sophronia, my affianced, so far from marvelling
               thereat, I should greatly marvel were it not so, knowing how fair
               she is, and how noble is thy soul, and thus the apter to be swayed by
               passion, the more excelling is she by whom thou art charmed.  And
               the juster the cause thou hast to love Sophronia, the greater is the
               injustice with which thou complainest of Fortune (albeit thou dost it
               not in so many words) for giving her to me, as if thy love of her had
               been seemly, had she belonged to any other but me;  whereas, if thou
               art still the wise man thou wast wont to be, thou must know that to
               none could Fortune have assigned her, with such good cause for thee
               to thank her, as to me. Had any other had her, albeit thy love had
               been seemly, he had loved her as his own, rather than as thine;
               which, if thou deem me even such a friend to thee as I am, thou wilt
               not apprehend from me, seeing that I mind me not that, since we
               were friends, I had ever aught that was not as much thine as mine.
               And so should I entreat thee herein as in all other matters, were the
               affair gone so far that nought else were possible; but as it is, I can
               make thee sole possessor of her; and so I mean to do; for I know
               not what cause thou shouldst have to prize my friendship, if, where
               in seemly sort it might be done, I knew not how to surrender my
               will to thine.  'Tis true that Sophronia is my betrothed, and that I
               loved her much, and had great cheer in expectation of the nuptials:
               but as thou, being much more discerning than I, dost more fervently
               affect this rare prize, rest assured that she will enter my chamber not
               mine but thine.  Wherefore, away with thy moodiness, banish thy
               melancholy, recover thy lost health, thy heartiness and jollity, and
               gladsomely, even from this very hour, anticipate the guerdon of thy
               love, a love worthier far than mine.
            </p>
            <p>Delightful as was the prospect with which hope flattered Titus,
               as he heard Gisippus thus speak, no less was the shame with which
               right reason affected him, admonishing him that the greater was the
               liberality of Gisippus, the less it would become him to profit thereby.
               Wherefore, still weeping, he thus constrained himself to make
               answer:  Gisippus, thy generous and true friendship leaves me in
               no doubt as to the manner in which it becomes me to act. God forefend
               that her, whom, as to the more worthy, He has given to thee, I
               should ever accept of thee for mine. Had He seen fit that she should
               be mine, far be it from thee or any other to suppose that He would
               ever have awarded her to thee.  Renounce not, then, that which thy
               choice and wise counsel and His gift have made thine, and leave me,
               to whom, as unworthy, He has appointed no such happiness, to
               waste my life in tears; for either I shall conquer my grief, which
               will be grateful to thee, or it will conquer me, and so I shall be quit
               of my pain.  Quoth then Gisippus: If our friendship, Titus, is
               of such a sort as may entitle me to enforce thee to ensue behests of
               mine, or as may induce thee of thine own free will to ensue the
               same, such is the use to which, most of all, I am minded to put it;
               and if thou lend not considerate ear unto my prayers, I shall by
               force, that force which is lawful in the interest of a friend, make
               Sophronia thine.  I know the might of Love, how redoubtable it is,
               and how, not once only, but oftentimes, it has brought ill-starred lovers
               to a miserable death; and thee I see so hard bested that turn back
               thou mightst not, nor get the better of thy grief, but holding on thy
               course, must succumb, and perish; and without doubt I should
               speedily follow thee.  And so, had I no other cause to love thee, thy
               life is precious to me in that my own is bound up with it. Sophronia,
               then, shall be thine; for thou wouldst not lightly find another so
               much to thy mind, and I shall readily find another to love, and so
               shall content both thee and me.  In which matter, peradventure, I
               might not be so liberal, were wives so scarce or hard to find as are
               friends; wherefore, as 'tis so easy a matter for me to find another
               wife, I had liefer--I say not lose her, for in giving her to thee lose
               her I shall not, but only transfer her to one that is my alter ego,
               and
               that to her advantage--I had liefer, I say, transfer her to thee than
               lose thee.  And so, if aught my prayers avail with thee, I entreat thee
               extricate thyself from this thy woeful plight, and comfort at once
               thyself and me, and in good hope, address thyself to pluck that boon
               which thy fervent love craves of her for whom thou yearnest.
            </p>
            <p>Still scrupling, for shame, to consent that Sophronia should become
               his wife, Titus remained yet a while inexorable; but, yielding at
               last to the solicitations of Love, reinforced by the exhortations of
               Gisippus, thus he made answer: Lo now, Gisippus, I know not
               how to call it, whether 'tis more thy pleasure than mine, this which
               I do, seeing that 'tis as thy pleasure that thou so earnestly entreatest
               me to do it; but, as thy liberality is such that my shame, though
               becoming, may not withstand it, I will even do it.  But of this rest
               assured, that I do so, witting well that I receive from thee, not only
               the lady I love, but with her my very life. And, Fate permitting,
               may the Gods grant me to make thee such honourable and goodly
               requital as may shew thee how sensible I am of the boon, which
               thou, more compassionate of me than I am of myself, conferrest on
               me.  Quoth then Gisippus: Now, for the giving effect to our
               purpose, methinks, Titus, we should proceed on this wise. Thou
               knowest that Sophronia, by treaty at length concluded between my
               family and hers, is become my betrothed: were I now to say that
               she should not be my wife, great indeed were the scandal that would
               come thereof, and I should affront both her family and mine own;
               whereof, indeed, I should make no account, so it gave me to see her
               become thine; but I fear that, were I to give her up at this juncture,
               her family would forthwith bestow her upon another, perchance,
               than thee, and so we should both be losers.  Wherefore
               methinks that, so thou approve, I were best to complete what I have
               begun, bring her home as my wife, and celebrate the nuptials, and
               thereafter we can arrange that thou lie with her, privily, as thy wife.
               Then, time and occasion serving, we will disclose the whole affair,
               and if they are satisfied, well and good; if not, 'twill be done all the
               same, and as it cannot be undone, they must perforce make the best
               of it.
            </p>
            <p>Which counsel being approved by Titus, Gisippus brought the
               lady home as his wife, Titus being now recovered, and quite himself
               again; and when they had made great cheer, and night was come,
               the ladies, having bedded the bride, took their departure.  Now the
               chambers of Titus and Gisippus were contiguous, and one might
               pass from one into the other: Gisippus, therefore, being come into
               his room, extinguished every ray of light, and stole into that of
               Titus, and bade him go get him to bed with his lady.  Whereat Titus
               gave way to shame, and would have changed his mind, and refused
               to go in; but Gisippus, no less zealous at heart than in words to
               serve his friend, after no small contention prevailed on him to go
               thither. Now no sooner was Titus abed with the lady, than, taking
               her in his arms, he, as if jestingly, asked in a low tone whether she
               were minded to be his wife.  She, taking him to be Gisippus,
               answered, yes; whereupon he set a fair and costly ring on her
               finger, saying: And I am minded to be thy husband. And
               having presently consummated the marriage, he long and amorously
               disported him with her, neither she, nor any other, being ever aware
               that another than Gisippus lay with her.
            </p>
            <p>Now Titus and Sophronia being after this sort wedded, Publius,
               the father of Titus, departed this life. For which cause Titus was
               bidden by letter to return forthwith to <span class="place">Rome</span> to see to his affairs;
               wherefore he took counsel with Gisippus how he might take
               Sophronia thither with him; which might not well be done without
               giving her to know how matters stood.  Whereof, accordingly, one
               day, having called her into the chamber, they fully apprised her,
               Titus for her better assurance bringing to her recollection not a little
               of what had passed between them.  Whereat she, after glancing from
               one to the other somewhat disdainfully, burst into a flood of tears,
               and reproached Gisippus that he had so deluded her; and forthwith,
               saying nought of the matter to any there, she hied her forth of
               Gisippus' house and home to her father, to whom and her mother
               she recounted the deceit which Gisippus had practised upon them as
               upon her, averring that she was the wife not of Gisippus, as they
               supposed, but of Titus.  Whereby her father was aggrieved exceedingly,
               and prolonged and grave complaint was made thereof by him
               and his own and Gisippus' families, and there was not a little parleying,
               and a world of pother. Gisippus earned the hatred of both his own and
               Sophronia's kin, and all agreed that he merited not only censure but
               severe punishment. He, however, averred that he had done a thing
               seemly, and that Sophronia's kinsfolk owed him thanks for giving her
               in marriage to one better than himself.
            </p>
            <p>All which Titus witnessed with great suffering, and witting that
               'twas the way of the Greeks to launch forth in high words and
               menaces, and refrain not until they should meet with one that
               answered them, whereupon they were wont to grow not only
               humble but even abject, was at length minded that their clavers
               should no longer pass unanswered;  and, as with his Roman temper he
               united Athenian subtlety, he cleverly contrived to bring the kinsfolk,
               as well of Gisippus as of Sophronia, together in a temple,
               where, being entered, attended only by Gisippus, thus (they being
               intent to hear) he harangued them:  'Tis the opinion of not a
               few philosophers that whatsoever mortals do is ordained by the providence
               of the immortal Gods; for which cause some would have it
               that nought either is, or ever shall be, done, save of necessity, albeit
               others there are that restrict this necessity to that which is already
               done.  Regard we but these opinions with some little attention, and
               we shall very plainly perceive that to censure that which cannot be
               undone is nought else but to be minded to shew oneself wiser than
               the Gods; by whom we must suppose that we and our affairs are
               swayed and governed with uniform and unerring wisdom. Whereby
               you may very readily understand how vain and foolish a presumption
               it is to pass judgment on their doings, and what manner and might
               of chains they need who suffer themselves to be transported to such
               excess of daring.  Among whom, in my judgment, you must one
               and all be numbered, if 'tis true, what I hear, to wit, that you have
               complained and do continue to complain that Sophronia, albeit you
               gave her to Gisippus, is, nevertheless, become my wife; not considering
               that 'twas ordained from all eternity that she should become, not
               the wife of Gisippus, but mine, as the fact does now declare.
            </p>
            <p>But, for that discourse of the secret providence and purposes of
               the Gods seems to many a matter hard and scarce to be understood,
               I am willing to assume that they meddle in no wise with our concerns,
               and to descend to the region of human counsels; in speaking
               whereof I must needs do two things quite at variance with my wont,
               to wit, in some degree praise myself and censure or vilify another.
               But, as in either case I mean not to deviate from the truth, and 'tis
               what the occasion demands, I shall not fail so to do.  With bitter
               upbraidings, animated rather by rage than by reason, you cease not
               to murmur, nay, to cry out, against Gisippus, and to harass him with
               your abuse, and hold him condemned, for that her, whom you saw
               fit to give him, he has seen fit to give me, to wife; wherein I deem
               him worthy of the highest commendation, and that for two reasons,
               first, because he has done the office of a friend, and secondly, because
               he has done more wisely than you did.  After what sort the sacred
               laws of friendship prescribe that friend shall entreat friend, 'tis not to
               my present purpose to declare; 'twill suffice to remind you that the
               tie of friendship should be more binding than that of blood, or
               kinship; seeing that our friends are of our own choosing, whereas our
               kinsfolk are appointed us by Fortune;  wherefore, if my life was more
               to Gisippus than your goodwill, since I am, as I hold myself, his
               friend, can any wonder thereat?
            </p>
            <p>But pass we to my second reason; in the exposition whereof I
               must needs with yet more cogency prove to you that he has been
               wiser than you, seeing that, methinks, you wot nought of the providence
               of the Gods, and still less of the consequences of friendship.  I
               say then, that, as 'twas your premeditated and deliberate choice that
               gave Sophronia to this young philosopher Gisippus, so 'twas his that
               gave her to another young philosopher. 'Twas your counsel that
               gave her to an Athenian; 'twas his that gave her to a Roman:
               'twas your counsel that gave her to a man of gentle birth; 'twas his
               that gave her to one of birth yet gentler: wealthy was he to whom
               your counsel gave her, most wealthy he to whom his counsel gave
               her. Not only did he to whom your counsel gave her, love her not,
               but he scarce knew her, whereas 'twas to one that loved her beyond
               all other blessings, nay, more dearly than his own life, that his
               counsel gave her.  And to the end that it may appear more plainly
               that 'tis even as I say, and Gisippus' counsel more to be commended
               than yours, let us examine it point by point. That I, like Gisippus,
               am young and a philosopher, my countenance and my pursuits may,
               without making more words about the matter, sufficiently attest.
               We are also of the same age, and have ever kept pace together in
               our studies.  Now true it is that he is an Athenian, and I am a
               Roman. But, as touching the comparative glory of the cities,
               should the matter be mooted, I say that I am of a free city, and he
               of a city tributary; that I am of a city that is mistress of all the
               world, and he of one that is subject to mine; that I am of a city
               that flourishes mightily in arms, in empire, and in arts; whereas he
               cannot boast his city as famous save in arts.
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, albeit you see me here in the guise of a most humble
               scholar, I am not born of the dregs of the populace of <span class="place">Rome</span>. My
               halls and the public places of <span class="place">Rome</span> are full of the antique effigies of
               my forefathers, and the annals of <span class="place">Rome</span> abound with the records of
               triumphs led by the Quintii to the Roman <span class="place">Capitol</span>; and so far from
               age having withered it, to-day, yet more abundantly than ever of
               yore, flourishes the glory of our name.  Of my wealth I forbear, for
               shame, to speak, being mindful that honest poverty is the time-honoured
               and richest inheritance of the noble citizens of <span class="place">Rome</span>;
               but, allowing for the nonce the opinion of the vulgar, which holds
               poverty in disrepute, and highly appraises wealth, I, albeit I never
               sought it, yet, as the favoured of Fortune, have abundant store
               thereof.  Now well I wot that, Gisippus being of your own city,
               you justly prized and prize an alliance with him; but not a whit
               less should you prize an alliance with me at <span class="place">Rome</span>, considering that
               there you will have in me an excellent host, and a patron apt, zealous
               and potent to serve you as well in matters of public interest as in
               your private concerns.  Who, then, dismissing all bias from his
               mind, and judging with impartial reason, would deem your counsel
               more commendable than that of Gisippus? Assuredly none.
               Sophronia, then, being married to Titus Quintius Fulvus, a citizen
               of <span class="place">Rome</span>, of an ancient and illustrious house, and wealthy, and a
               friend of Gisippus, whoso takes umbrage or offence thereat, does
               that which it behoves him not to do, and knows not what he does.
            </p>
            <p>Perchance some will say that their complaint is not that
               Sophronia is the wife of Titus, but that she became his wife after
               such a sort, to wit, privily, by theft, neither friend nor any of her
               kin witting aught thereof; but herein is no matter of marvel, no
               prodigy as yet unheard-of.  I need not instance those who before
               now have taken to them husbands in defiance of their fathers' will,
               or have eloped with their lovers and been their mistresses before they
               were their wives, or of whose marriages no word has been spoken,
               until their pregnancy or parturition published them to the world,
               and necessity sanctioned the fact: nought of this has happened in
               the case of Sophronia; on the contrary, 'twas in proper form, and in
               meet and seemly sort, that Gisippus gave her to Titus.  And others,
               peradventure, will say that 'twas by one to whom such office belonged
               not that she was bestowed in marriage. Nay, but this is but
               vain and womanish querulousness, and comes of scant consideration.
               Know we not, then, that Fortune varies according to circumstances
               her methods and her means of disposing events to their predetermined
               ends?  What matters it to me, if it be a cobbler, rather than
               a philosopher, that Fortune has ordained to compass something for
               me, whether privily or overtly, so only the result is as it should be?
               I ought, indeed, to take order, if the cobbler be indiscreet, that he
               meddle no more in affairs of mine, but, at the same time, I ought to
               thank him for what he has done.  If Gisippus has duly bestowed
               Sophronia in marriage, it is gratuitous folly to find fault with the
               manner and the person. If you mistrust his judgment, have a care
               that it be not in his power to do the like again, but thank him
               for this turn.
            </p>
            <p>Natheless, you are to know that I used no cunning practice or
               deceit to sully in any degree the fair fame of your house in the
               person of Sophronia;  and, albeit I took her privily to wife, I came
               not as a ravisher to despoil her of her virginity, nor in any hostile
               sort was I minded to make her mine on dishonourable terms, and
               spurn your alliance; but, being fervently enamoured of her bewitching
               beauty and her noble qualities, I wist well that, should I
               make suit for her with those formalities which you, perchance, will
               say were due, then, for the great love you bear her, and for fear lest I
               should take her away with me to <span class="place">Rome</span>, I might not hope to have
               her.  Accordingly I made use of the secret practice which is now
               manifest to you, and brought Gisippus to consent in my interest to
               that whereto he was averse;  and thereafter, ardently though I loved
               her, I sought not to commingle with her as a lover, but as a husband,
               nor closed with her, until, as she herself by her true witness
               may assure you, I had with apt words and with the ring made her
               my lawful wife, asking her if she would have me to husband, whereto
               she answered, yes. Wherein if she seem to have been tricked, 'tis
               not I that am to blame, but she, for that she asked me not who I was.
            </p>
            <p>This, then, is the great wrong, sin, crime, whereof for love and
               friendship's sake Gisippus and I are guilty, that Sophronia is privily
               become the wife of Titus Quintius: 'tis for this that you harass him
               with your menaces and hostile machinations.  What more would
               you do, had he given her to a villein, to a caitiff, to a slave? Where
               would you find fetters, dungeons, crosses adequate to your vengeance?
               But enough of this at present: an event, which I did not
               expect, has now happened; my father is dead; and I must needs
               return to <span class="place">Rome</span>; wherefore, being fain to take Sophronia with me,
               I have discovered to you that which otherwise I had, perchance, still
               kept close. Whereto, if you are wise, you will gladly reconcile
               yourselves; for that, if I had been minded to play you false, or put
               an affront upon you, I might have scornfully abandoned her to you;
               but God forefend that such baseness be ever harboured in a Roman
               breast.  Sophronia, then, by the will of the Gods, by force of law,
               and by my own love-taught astuteness, is mine. The which it would
               seem that you, deeming yourselves, peradventure, wiser than the
               Gods, or the rest of mankind, do foolishly set at nought, and that in
               two ways alike most offensive to me; inasmuch as you both withhold
               from me Sophronia, in whom right, as against me, you have
               none, and also entreat as your enemy Gisippus, to whom you are
               rightfully bounden.  The folly whereof I purpose not at present
               fully to expound to you, but in friendly sort to counsel you to abate
               your wrath and abandon all your schemes of vengeance, and restore
               Sophronia to me, that I may part from you on terms of amity and
               alliance, and so abide:  but of this rest assured, that whether this,
               which is done, like you or not, if you are minded to contravene it, I
               shall take Gisippus hence with me, and once arrived in <span class="place">Rome</span>, shall
               in your despite find means to recover her who is lawfully mine, and
               pursuing you with unremitting enmity, will apprise you by experience
               of the full measure and effect of a Roman's wrath.
            </p>
            <p>Having so said, Titus started to his feet, his countenance distorted
               by anger, and took Gisippus by the hand, and with manifest
               contempt for all the rest, shaking his head at them and threatening
               them, led him out of the temple.  They that remained in the
               temple, being partly persuaded by his arguments to accept his
               alliance and friendship, partly terrified by his last words, resolved by
               common consent that 'twas better to have the alliance of Titus, as
               they had lost that of Gisippus, than to add to that loss the enmity of
               Titus.  Wherefore they followed Titus, and having come up with
               him, told him that they were well pleased that Sophronia should be
               his, and that they should prize his alliance and the friendship of dear
               Gisippus; and having ratified this treaty of amity and alliance with
               mutual cheer, they departed and sent Sophronia to Titus. Sophronia,
               discreetly making a virtue of necessity, transferred forthwith to Titus
               the love she had borne Gisippus, and being come with Titus to <span class="place">Rome</span>,
               was there received with no small honour.  Gisippus tarried in Athens,
               held in little account by well-nigh all the citizens, and being involved
               in certain of their broils, was, not long afterwards, with all his
               household,
               banished the city, poor, nay, destitute, and condemned to perpetual
               exile.  Thus hard bested, and at length reduced to mendicancy,
               he made his way, so as least discomfortably he might, to <span class="place">Rome</span>,
               being minded to see whether Titus would remember him: and
               there, learning that Titus lived, and was much affected by all the
               Romans, and having found out his house, he took his stand in front
               of it, and watched until Titus came by;  to whom, for shame of the
               sorry trim that he was in, he ventured no word, but did his endeavour
               that he might be seen of him, hoping that Titus might recognize
               him, and call him by his name: but Titus passing on, Gisippus
               deeming that he had seen and avoided him, and calling to mind that
               which aforetime he had done for him, went away wroth and
               desperate.  And fasting and penniless, and--for 'twas now night--knowing
               not whither he went, and yearning above all for death, he
               wandered by chance to a spot, which, albeit 'twas within the city,
               had much of the aspect of a wilderness, and espying a spacious
               grotto, he took shelter there for the night; and worn out at last with
               grief, on the bare ground, wretchedly clad as he was, he fell asleep.
            </p>
            <p>Now two men that had that night gone out a thieving, having
               committed the theft, came towards morning to the grotto, and there
               quarrelled, and the stronger slew the other, and took himself off.
               Aroused by the noise, Gisippus witnessed the murder, and deeming
               that he had now the means of compassing, without suicide, the death
               for which he so much longed, budged not a jot, but stayed there,
               until the serjeants of the court, which had already got wind of the
               affair, came on the scene, and laid violent hands upon him, and led
               him away.  Being examined, he confessed that he had slain the man,
               and had then been unable to make his escape from the grotto.
               Wherefore the praetor, Marcus Varro by name, sentenced him to
               death by crucifixion, as was then the custom.  But Titus, who
               happened at that moment to come into the praetorium, being told
               the crime for which he was condemned, and scanning the poor
               wretch's face, presently recognized him for Gisippus, and marvelled
               how he should come to be there, and in such a woeful plight. And
               most ardently desiring to succour him, nor seeing other way to save
               his life except to exonerate him by accusing himself, he straightway
               stepped forward, and said with a loud voice:  Marcus Varro, call
               back the poor man on whom thou hast passed sentence, for he is
               innocent. 'Tis enough that I have incurred the wrath of the Gods
               by one deed of violence, to wit, the murder of him whom your
               serjeants found dead this morning, without aggravating my offence
               by the death of another innocent man.  Perplexed, and vexed that he
               should have been heard by all in the praetorium, but unable honourably
               to avoid compliance with that which the laws enjoined, Varro
               had Gisippus brought back, and in presence of Titus said to him:
               How camest thou to be so mad as, though no constraint was put
               upon thee, to confess a deed thou never didst, thy life being at stake?
               Thou saidst that 'twas thou by whom the man was slain last night,
               and now comes this other, and says that 'twas not thou but he that
               slew him.  Gisippus looked, and seeing Titus, wist well that, being
               grateful for the service rendered by him in the past, Titus was now
               minded to save his life at the cost of his own: wherefore, affected to
               tears, he said: Nay but, Varro, in very sooth I slew him, and 'tis
               now too late, this tender solicitude of Titus for my deliverance.
               But on his part: Praetor, quoth Titus, thou seest this man is
               a stranger, and was found unarmed beside the murdered man; thou
               canst not doubt that he was fain of death for very wretchedness:
               wherefore discharge him, and let punishment light on me who have
               merited it.
            </p>
            <p>Marvelling at the importunity of both, Varro readily surmised
               that neither was guilty. And while he was casting about how he
               might acquit them, lo, in came a young man, one Publius Ambustus,
               a desperate character, and known to all the Romans for an arrant
               thief. He it was that had verily committed the murder,  and witting
               both the men to be innocent of that of which each accused himself, so
               sore at heart was he by reason of their innocence, that, overborne by
               an exceeding great compassion, he presented himself before Varro,
               and:  Praetor, quoth he, 'tis destiny draws me hither to loose
               the knot of these men's contention; and some God within me leaves
               me no peace of his whips and stings, until I discover my offence:
               wherefore know that neither of these men is guilty of that of which
               each accuses himself.  'Tis verily I that slew the man this morning
               about daybreak; and before I slew him, while I was sharing our
               plunder with him, I espied this poor fellow asleep there. Nought
               need I say to clear Titus: the general bruit of his illustrious renown
               attests that he is not a man of such a sort. Discharge him, therefore,
               and exact from me the penalty prescribed by the laws.
            </p>
            <p>The affair had by this time come to the ears of Octavianus, who
               caused all three to be brought before him, and demanded to know
               the causes by which they had been severally moved to accuse themselves;
               and, each having told his story, Octavianus released the two
               by reason of their innocence, and the third for love of them.  Titus
               took Gisippus home, having first chidden him not a little for his
               faint-heartedness and diffidence, and there, Sophronia receiving him as
               a brother, did him marvellous cheer;  and having comforted him a
               while, and arrayed him in apparel befitting his worth and birth, he
               first shared with him all his substance, and then gave him his sister,
               a young damsel named <span class="person">Fulvia</span>, to wife, and said to him: Choose
               now, Gisippus, whether thou wilt tarry here with me, or go back
               to <span class="place">Achaia</span> with all that I have given thee.
            </p>
            <p>Partly perforce of his banishment from his city, partly for that
               the sweet friendship of Titus was justly dear to him, Gisippus
               consented to become a Roman. And so, long and happily they
               lived together at <span class="place">Rome</span>, Gisippus with his <span class="person">Fulvia</span>, and Titus with
               his Sophronia, in the same house, growing, if possible, greater friends
               day by day.
            </p>
            <p>Exceeding sacred then, is friendship, and worthy not only to be
               had in veneration, but to be extolled with never-ending praise, as the
               most dutiful mother of magnificence and seemliness, sister of gratitude
               and charity, and foe to enmity and avarice; ever, without waiting
               to be asked, ready to do as generously by another as she would be
               done by herself.  Rarely indeed is it to-day that twain are found, in
               whom her most holy fruits are manifest; for which is most shamefully
               answerable the covetousness of mankind, which, regarding only
               private interest, has banished friendship beyond earth's farthest bourne,
               there to abide in perpetual exile.  How should love, or wealth, or
               kinship, how should aught but friendship have so quickened the soul
               of Gisippus that the tears and sighs of Titus should incline his heart
               to cede to him the fair and gracious lady that was his betrothed and
               his beloved?  Laws, menaces, terror! How should these, how should
               aught but friendship, have withheld Gisippus, in lonely places, in
               hidden retreats, in his own bed, from enfolding (not perchance unsolicited
               by her) the fair damsel within his youthful embrace?
               Honours, rewards, gains! Would Gisippus for these, would he for
               aught but friendship, have made nothing of the loss of kindred--his
               own and Sophronia's--have made nothing of the injurious murmurs
               of the populace, have made nothing of mocks and scorns, so only
               he might content his friend?  And on the other hand, for what
               other cause than friendship had Titus, when he might decently have
               feigned not to see, have striven with the utmost zeal to compass his
               own death, and set himself upon the cross in Gisippus' stead?  
               [*** missing sentence: please see Italian  ***] 
               And
               what but friendship had left no place for suspicion in the soul of
               Titus, and filled it with a most fervent desire to give his sister to
               Gisippus, albeit he saw him to be reduced to extreme penury
               and destitution?  But so it is that men covet hosts of acquaintance,
               troops of kinsfolk, offspring in plenty; and the number of their
               dependants increases with their wealth; and they reflect not that
               there is none of these, be he who he may, but will be more apprehensive
               of the least peril threatening himself than cumbered to avert
               a great peril from his lord or kinsman, whereas between friends we
               know 'tis quite contrariwise.

            <p>Saladin, in guise of a merchant, is honourably entreated
               by Messer Torello. The Crusade ensuing, Messer
               Torello appoints a date, after which his wife may
               marry again: he is taken prisoner, and by training
               hawks comes under the Soldan's notice. The Soldan
               recognizes him, makes himself known to him, and
               entreats him with all honour. Messer Torello falls
               sick, and by magic arts is transported in a single night
               to <span class="place">Pavia</span>, where his wife's second marriage is then to be
               solemnized, and being present thereat, is recognized by
               her, and returns with her to his house.

                  justice did she deplore in her closing words the little account in

                  which will be of considerable length, but entertaining throughout,
                  an instance of Saladin's magnificence, to the end that, albeit, by reason
                  of our vices, it may not be possible for us to gain to the full the
                  friendship of any, yet by the matters whereof you shall hear in my
                  story we may at least be incited to take delight in doing good offices,
                  in the hope that sooner or later we may come by our reward

            <p>I say, then, that in the time of the Emperor Frederic I., as
               certain writers affirm, the Christians made common emprise for the
               recovery of the <span class="place">Holy Land</span>. Whereof that most valiant prince,
               Saladin, then Soldan of <span class="place">Babylon</span>ia, being in good time apprised,
               resolved to see for himself the preparations made by the Christian
               potentates for the said emprise, that he might put himself in better
               trim to meet them.  So, having ordered all things to his mind in
               <span class="place">Egypt</span>, he made as if he were bound on a pilgrimage, and attended
               only by two of his chiefest and sagest lords, and three servants, took
               the road in the guise of a merchant.  And having surveyed many
               provinces of Christendom, as they rode through <span class="place">Lombardy</span> with
               intent to cross the Alps, they chanced, between <span class="place">Milan</span> and <span class="place">Pavia</span>, to
               fall in with a gentleman, one Messer Torello d'Istria da <span class="place">Pavia</span>, who
               with his servants and his dogs and falcons was betaking him to a fine
               estate that he had on the <span class="place">Ticino</span>, there to tarry a while.  Now
               Messer Torello no sooner espied Saladin and his lords than he
               guessed them to be gentlemen and foreigners; and, being zealous to
               do them honour, when Saladin asked one of his servants how far
               off <span class="place">Pavia</span> might still be, and if he might win there in time to enter
               the town, he suffered not the servant to make answer, but: No,
               gentlemen, quoth he, by the time you reach <span class="place">Pavia</span> 'twill be too
               late for you to enter.  So! replied Saladin, then might you
               be pleased to direct us, as we are strangers, where we may best be
               lodged?  That gladly will I, returned Messer Torello. I
               was but now thinking to send one of these my men on an errand to
               <span class="place">Pavia</span>; I will send him with you, and he will guide you to a place
               where you will find very comfortable quarters.  Then, turning to
               one of his most trusty servants, he gave him his instructions, and
               despatched him with them: after which, he repaired to his estate,
               and forthwith, as best he might, caused a goodly supper to be made
               ready, and the tables set in his garden; which done, he stationed
               himself at the gate on the look-out for his guests.
            </p>
            <p>The servant, conversing with the gentlemen of divers matters,
               brought them by devious roads to his lord's estate without their being
               ware of it.  Whom as soon as Messer Torello espied, he came forth
               afoot to meet them, and said with a smile: A hearty welcome to
               you, gentlemen.  Now Saladin, being very quick of apprehension,
               perceived that the knight had doubted, when he met them, that, were
               he to bid them to his house, they might not accept his hospitality;
               and accordingly, that it might not be in their power to decline it, had
               brought them to his house by a ruse. And so, returning his greeting:
               Sir, quoth he, were it meet to find fault with those that shew
               courtesy, we should have a grievance against you, for that, to say
               nought of somewhat delaying our journey, you have in guerdon of
               a single greeting constrained us to accept so noble a courtesy as
               yours.  Whereto the knight, who was of good understanding and
               well-spoken, made answer: Gentlemen, such courtesy as we
               shew you will, in comparison of that which, by what I gather from
               your aspect, were meet for you, prove but a sorry thing; but in sooth
               this side of <span class="place">Pavia</span> you might not anywhere have been well lodged;
               wherefore take it not amiss that you have come somewhat out of
               your way to find less discomfortable quarters.  And as he spoke,
               about them flocked the servants, who, having helped them to dismount,
               saw to their horses; whereupon Messer Torello conducted them to
               the chambers that were made ready for them, where, having caused
               them to be relieved of their boots, and refreshed with the coolest of
               wines, he held pleasant converse with them until supper-time.
               Saladin and his lords and servants all knew Latin, so that they both
               understood and made themselves understood very well, and there
               was none of them but adjudged this knight to be the most agreeable
               and debonair man, and therewithal the best talker, that he had ever
               seen;  while to Messer Torello, on the other hand, they shewed as
               far greater magnificoes than he had at first supposed, whereby he was
               inly vexed that he had not been able that evening to do them the
               honours of company, and a more ceremonious banquet. For which
               default he resolved to make amends on the ensuing morning: wherefore,
               having imparted to one of his servants that which he would have
               done, he sent him to his most judicious and highminded lady at
               <span class="place">Pavia</span>, which was close by, and where never a gate was locked.
               Which done, he brought the gentlemen into the garden, and courteously
               asked them who they were. We are Cypriote merchants,
               replied Saladin, and 'tis from <span class="place">Cyprus</span> we come, and we are on our
               way to <span class="place">Paris</span> on business. Quoth then Messer Torello: Would
               to God that our country bred gentlemen of such a quality as are the
               merchants that I see <span class="place">Cyprus</span> breeds!  From which they passed to
               discourse of other matters, until, supper-time being come, he
               besought them to seat them at table; whereat, considering that
               the supper was but improvised, their entertainment was excellent
               and well-ordered.
            </p>
            <p>The tables being cleared, Messer Torello, surmising that they
               must be weary, kept them no long time from their rest, but bestowed
               them in most comfortable beds, and soon after went to rest himself.
               Meanwhile the servant that he had sent to <span class="place">Pavia</span> did his lord's errand
               to the lady, who, in the style rather of a queen than of a housewife,
               forthwith assembled not a few of Messer Torello's friends and vassals,
               and caused all meet preparation to be made for a magnificent banquet,
               and by messengers bearing torches bade not a few of the noblest of
               the citizens thereto; and had store of silken and other fabrics and
               vair brought in, and all set in order in every point as her husband
               had directed.  Day came, and the gentlemen being risen, Messer
               Torello got him to horse with them, and having sent for his hawks,
               brought them to a ford, and shewed them how the hawks flew.
               By and by, Saladin requesting of him a guide to the best inn at
               <span class="place">Pavia</span>: I myself will be your guide, returned Messer Torello,
               for I have occasion to go thither.  Which offer they, nothing
               doubting, did gladly accept, and so with him they set forth; and
               about tierce, being come to the city, and expecting to be directed to
               the best inn, they were brought by Messer Torello to his own house,
               where they were forthwith surrounded by full fifty of the greatest
               folk of the city, gathered there to give the gentlemen a welcome;
               and 'twas who should hold a bridle or a stirrup, while they dismounted.
               Whereby Saladin and his lords more than guessing the
               truth: Messer Torello, quoth they, 'twas not this that we
               craved of you. Honour enough had we from you last night, and
               far in excess of our desires; wherefore thou mightst very well have
               left us to go our own road.  Whereto: Gentlemen, replied
               Messer Torello, for that which was done yestereve I have to thank
               Fortune rather than you: seeing that Fortune surprised you on the
               road at an hour when you must needs repair to my little house: for
               that which shall be done this morning I shall be beholden to you, as
               will also these gentlemen that surround you, with whom, if you
               deem it courteous so to do, you may refuse to breakfast, if you
               like.
            </p>
            <p>Fairly conquered, Saladin and his lords dismounted, and heartily
               welcomed by the gentlemen, were conducted to the chambers which
               had been most sumptuously adorned for their use; and having laid
               aside their riding dress, and taken some refreshment, repaired to the
               saloon, where all had been made ready with splendour. There,
               having washed their hands, they sat them down to table, and were
               regaled with a magnificent repast of many courses, served with all
               stately and fair ceremony, insomuch that, had the Emperor himself
               been there, 'twould not have been possible to do him more honour.
               And albeit Saladin and his lords were grandees, and used to exceeding
               great displays of pomp and state, nevertheless this shewed to them
               as not a little marvellous, and one of the greatest they had ever seen,
               having regard to the quality of their host, whom they knew to be
               but a citizen, and no lord.  Breakfast done, and the tables cleared,
               they conversed a while of high matters, and then, as 'twas very hot,
               all the gentlemen of <span class="place">Pavia</span>--so it pleased Messer Torello--retired for
               their siesta, while he remained with his three guests; with whom he
               presently withdrew into a chamber, whither, that there might be
               nought that he held dear which they had not seen, he called his
               noble lady.  And so the dame, exceeding fair and stately of person,
               and arrayed in rich apparel, with her two little boys, that shewed as
               two angels, on either hand, presented herself before them, and
               graciously greeted them. Whereupon they rose, and returned her
               salutation with reverence, and caused her to sit down among them,
               and made much of her two little boys.  But after some interchange
               of gracious discourse, Messer Torello being withdrawn somewhat
               apart, she asked them courteously, whence they came and whither
               they were bound, and had of them the same answer that Messer
               Torello had received.  So! quoth the lady with a joyful air,
               then I see that my woman's wit will be of service to you; wherefore
               I pray you as a special favour neither to reject nor to despise the
               little gift that I am about to present to you; but reflecting that, as
               women have but small minds, so they make but small gifts, accept it,
               having regard rather to the good will of the giver than the magnitude
               of the gift.  She then caused bring forth for each of them
               two pair of robes, lined the one with silk, the other with vair, no
               such robes as citizens or merchants, but such as lords, use to wear,
               and three vests of taffeta, besides linen clothes, and: Take them,
               quoth she. The robes I give you are even such as I have arrayed
               my lord withal: the other things, considering that you are far from
               your wives, and have come a long way, and have yet a long way to
               go, and that merchants love to be neat and trim, may, albeit they
               are of no great value, be yet acceptable to you.
            </p>
            <p>Wondering, the gentlemen acknowledged without reserve that
               there was no point of courtesy wherein Messer Torello was not
               minded to acquit himself towards them. And noting the lordly
               fashion of the robes, unsuited to the quality of merchants, they misdoubted
               that Messer Torello had recognized them. However, quoth
               one of them to the lady: Gifts great indeed are these, Madam,
               nor such as lightly to accept, were it not that thereto we are constrained
               by your prayers, to which we may on no account say, no.
               Whereupon, Messer Torello being now come back, the lady bade
               them adieu, and took her leave of them; and in like manner did she
               cause their servants to be supplied with equipment suitable to them.
               The gentlemen, being much importuned thereto by Messer Torello,
               consented to tarry the rest of the day with him; and so, having
               slept, they donned their robes, and rode a while with him about the
               city; and supper-time being come, they feasted magnificently, and
               with a numerous and honourable company.  And so in due time
               they betook them to rest; and at daybreak, being risen, they found,
               in lieu of their jaded nags, three stout and excellent palfreys, and in
               like manner fresh and goodly mounts for their servants. Which
               Saladin marking turned to his lords, and:  By God, quoth he,
               never was gentleman more complete and courteous and considerate
               than this Messer Torello, and if the Christian kings are as kingly as
               he is knightly, there is none of them whose onset the Soldan of
               <span class="place">Babylon</span> might well abide, to say nought of so many as we see making
               ready to fall upon him. However, knowing that 'twas not permissible
               to refuse, he very courteously thanked Messer Torello: and
               so they got them to horse.  Messer Torello with a numerous company
               escorted them far beyond the gate of the city, until, loath
               though Saladin was to part from him, so greatly did he now affect
               him, yet as he must needs speed on, he besought him to turn back.
               Whereupon, albeit it irked him to take leave of them:  Gentlemen,
               quoth Messer Torello, since such is your pleasure, I obey;
               but this I must say to you. Who you are I know not, nor would I
               know more than you are pleased to impart; but whoever you may
               be, you will not make me believe that you are merchants this while;
               and so adieu!  To whom Saladin, having already taken leave of
               all his company, thus made answer: Peradventure, Sir, we shall
               one day give you to see somewhat of our merchandise, and thereby
               confirm your belief: and so adieu!
            </p>
            <p>Thus parted Saladin and his company from Messer Torello,
               Saladin burning with an exceeding great desire, if life should be continued
               to him, and the war, which he anticipated, should not undo
               him, to shew Messer Torello no less honour than he had received at
               his hands, and conversing not a little with his lords both of Messer
               Torello himself and of his lady, and all that he did and that in any wise
               concerned him, ever more highly commending them.  However,
               having with much diligence spied out all the West, he put to sea,
               and returned with his company to <span class="place">Alexandria</span>; and having now all
               needful information, he put himself in a posture of defence. Messer
               Torello, his mind full of his late guests, returned to <span class="place">Pavia</span>; but,
               though he long pondered who they might be, he came never at or
               anywhere near the truth.
            </p>
            <p>Then with great and general mustering of forces came the time
               for embarking on the emprise, and Messer Torello, heeding not the
               tearful entreaties of his wife, resolved to join therein. So, being fully
               equipped and about to take horse, he said to his lady, whom he most
               dearly loved:  Wife, for honour's sake and for the weal of my
               soul, I go, as thou seest, on this emprise: our substance and our
               honour I commend to thy care. Certain I am of my departure, but,
               for the thousand accidents that may ensue, certitude have I none of
               my return: wherefore I would have thee do me this grace, that,
               whatever be my fate, shouldst thou lack certain intelligence that I
               live, thou wilt expect me a year and a month and a day from this
               my departure, before thou marry again.  Whereto the lady, weeping
               bitterly, made answer: Messer Torello, I know not how I
               shall support the distress in which, thus departing, you leave me;
               but should my life not fail beneath it, and aught befall thee,
               live and die secure that I shall live and die the wife of Messer
               Torello, and of his memory.  Whereupon: Wife, returned
               Messer Torello, well assured I am that, so far as in thee
               shall lie, this promise of thine will be kept; but thou art
               young, and fair, and of a great family, and thy virtue is rare and
               generally known:  wherefore I make no doubt that, should there be
               any suspicion of my death, thou wilt be asked of thy brothers and
               kinsmen by many a great gentleman: against whose attacks, though
               thou desire it never so, thou wilt not be able to hold out, but wilt
               perforce be fain to gratify one or other of them; for which cause it
               is that I ask thee to wait just so long and no longer.  As I have
               said, replied the lady, so, in so far as I may, I shall do; and if I
               must needs do otherwise, rest assured that of this your behest I shall
               render you obedience. But I pray God that He bring neither you
               nor me to such a strait yet a while.  Which said, the lady wept,
               and having embraced Messer Torello, drew from her finger a ring,
               and gave it to him, saying: Should it betide that I die before I
               see you again, mind you of me, when you look upon it.
            </p>
            <p>Messer Torello took the ring, and got him to horse, and having
               bidden all adieu, fared forth on his journey; and being arrived with
               his company at <span class="place">Genoa</span>, he embarked on a galley, and having departed
               thence, in no long time arrived at Acre, and joined the main
               Christian host;  wherein there by and by broke out an exceeding
               great and mortal sickness; during which, whether owing to Saladin's
               strategy, or his good fortune, he made an easy capture of well-nigh
               all the remnant of the Christians that were escaped, and quartered
               them in divers prisons in many cities;  of which captives Messer
               Torello being one, was brought to <span class="place">Alexandria</span> and there confined.
               Where, not being known, and fearing to make himself known, he,
               under constraint of necessity, applied him to the training of hawks,
               whereof he was a very great master; and thereby he fell under the
               notice of Saladin, who took him out of the prison, and made him his
               falconer.  The Soldan called him by no other name than Christian,
               and neither recognized, nor was recognized by, him, who, his
               whole soul ever in <span class="place">Pavia</span>, essayed many a time to escape, that he
               might return thither, but still without success:  wherefore, certain
               Genoese, that were come to <span class="place">Alexandria</span> as ambassadors to the Soldan
               for the redemption of some of their townsfolk, being about to return,
               he resolved to write to his lady, how that he lived, and would come
               back to her, as soon as he might, and that she should expect his
               return; and having so done, he earnestly besought one of the
               ambassadors, whom he knew, to see that the letter reached the
               hands of the Abbot of San Pietro in Ciel d'Oro, who was his
               uncle.
            </p>
            <p>Now, such being the posture of Messer Torello's affairs, it befell
               one day that, while he talked with Saladin of his hawks, he smiled;
               whereby his mouth shaped itself in a fashion, of which Saladin had
               taken particular note, while he was at <span class="place">Pavia</span>. And so, recalling
               Messer Torello to mind, he fixed his gaze upon him, and it seemed
               to him that 'twas indeed Messer Torello; wherefore, leaving the
               matter of which they were conversing: Tell me, Christian,
               quoth he, of what country art thou in the West?  My lord,
               replied Messer Torello, I am a Lombard, of a city called <span class="place">Pavia</span>, a
               poor man, and of humble condition.  Which when he heard,
               Saladin, well-nigh resolved of his doubt, said joyfully to himself:
               God has provided me with occasion meet to prove to this man
               what store I set by his courtesy; and without another word he
               brought him into a room where he kept all his wearing apparel, and
               said: Look, Christian, if among these robes there be any that
               thou hast ever seen before.  So Messer Torello examined the robes,
               and espied those which his lady had given to Saladin; but, deeming
               they could not be the same, he replied: My lord, there is no robe
               here that I recognize, albeit 'tis true that those two robes are such as
               I once wore myself, in company with three merchants that came to
               my house.  Whereupon Saladin could refrain himself no longer;
               but, tenderly embracing him: You, quoth he, are Messer
               Torello d'Istria, and I am one of those three merchants to whom
               your lady gave these robes; and now is the time to warrant you of
               the quality of my merchandise, as, when I parted from you, I told
               you might come to pass.  Which to hear, Messer Torello was at
               once overjoyed and abashed, overjoyed to have entertained so illustrious
               a guest, and abashed, for that it seemed to him that he
               had given him but a sorry entertainment. To whom: Messer
               Torello, quoth Saladin, since hither has God sent you to me,
               deem that 'tis no more I that am lord here, but you.  And so
               they made great cheer together; and then Saladin caused Messer
               Torello to be royally arrayed; and presented him to all his greatest
               lords, and having extolled his merit in no stinted measure, bade
               all, as they hoped for grace from him, honour Messer Torello
               even as himself. And so from that hour did they all; but most
               especially the two lords that had been with Saladin at Messer Torello's
               house.
            </p>
            <p>The glory, to which Messer Torello thus suddenly found himself
               raised, somewhat diverted his mind from the affairs of <span class="place">Lombardy</span>,
               and the more so, for that he entertained no doubt that his letter
               had reached his uncle's hands.  But for that in the camp, or rather
               army, of the Christians, on the day when they were taken by Saladin,
               there died and was buried one Messer Torello de Dignes, an obscure
               knight of <span class="place">Provence</span>, whereas Messer Torello d'Istria was known to
               all the host for a right noble gentleman, whoso heard tell that
               Messer Torello was dead, supposed that 'twas Messer Torello d'Istria,
               and not Messer Torello de Dignes; nor did what happened after,
               to wit, the capture, avail to undeceive them;  for not a few Italians
               had carried the report home with them; among whom there were
               some who made bold to say that they had seen Messer Torello
               d'Istria's dead body, and had been present at its interment.  Which
               rumour coming to the ears of his lady and his kinsfolk, great indeed,
               nay, immeasurable was the distress that it occasioned not only to
               them, but to all that had known him.  The mode and measure of his
               lady's grief, her mourning, her lamentation, 'twere tedious to describe.
               Enough that, after some months spent in almost unmitigated
               tribulation, her sorrow shewed signs of abatement; whereupon, suit
               being made for her hand by some of the greatest men of <span class="place">Lombardy</span>,
               her brothers and other kinsfolk began to importune her to marry
               again. Times not a few, and with floods of tears, she refused; but,
               overborne at last, she consented to do as they would have her, upon
               the understanding that she was to remain unmarried until the term
               for which she had bound herself to Messer Torello was fulfilled.
            </p>
            <p>Now the lady's affairs being in this posture at <span class="place">Pavia</span>, it befell
               that some eight days or so before the time appointed for her marriage,
               Messer Torello one day espied in <span class="place">Alexandria</span> one that he had
               observed go with the Genoese ambassadors aboard the galley that
               took them to <span class="place">Genoa</span>; wherefore he called him, and asked him what
               sort of a voyage they had had, and when they had reached <span class="place">Genoa</span>.
               My lord, replied the other, the galley made but a sorry voyage of
               it, as I learned in <span class="place">Crete</span>, where I remained; for that, while she was
               nearing <span class="place">Sicily</span>, there arose a terrible gale from the North that drove
               her on to the shoals of Barbary, and never a soul escaped, and among
               the rest my two brothers were lost.  Which report believing--and
               'twas indeed most true--and calling to mind that in a few days the
               term that he had asked of his wife would be fulfilled, and surmising
               that there could be no tidings of him at <span class="place">Pavia</span>, Messer Torello made
               no question but that the lady was provided with another husband;
               whereby he sank into such a depth of woe that he lost all power to
               eat, and betook him to his bed and resigned himself to die.  Which
               when Saladin, by whom he was most dearly beloved, learned, he
               came to him, and having plied him with many and most instant
               entreaties, learned at length the cause of his distress and sickness;
               and, having chidden him not a little that he had not sooner apprised
               him thereof, he besought him to put on a cheerful courage, assuring
               him, that, if so he did, he would bring it to pass that he should be in
               <span class="place">Pavia</span> at the time appointed, and told him how.  Believing Saladin's
               words the more readily that he had many times heard that 'twas
               possible, and had not seldom been done, Messer Torello recovered
               heart, and was instant with Saladin that he should make all haste.
            </p>
            <p>Accordingly Saladin bade one of his necromancers, of whose skill
               he had already had proof, to devise a method whereby Messer Torello
               should be transported abed in a single night to <span class="place">Pavia</span>: the necromancer
               made answer that it should be done, but that 'twere best
               he put Messer Torello to sleep.  The matter being thus arranged,
               Saladin hied him back to Messer Torello, and finding him most
               earnestly desirous to be in <span class="place">Pavia</span> at the time appointed, if so it might
               be, and if not, to die:  Messer Torello, quoth he, if you dearly
               love your lady, and misdoubt that she may become the bride of
               another, no wise, God wot, do I censure you, for that, of all the
               ladies that ever I saw, she, for bearing, manners, and address--to say
               nought of beauty, which is but the flower that perishes--seems to
               me the most worthy to be lauded and cherished.  Much had I been
               gratified, since Fortune has sent you hither to me, that, while you and
               I yet live, we had exercised equal lordship in the governance of this
               my realm,  and, if such was not God's will, and this must needs come
               upon you, that you are fain either to be at <span class="place">Pavia</span> at the time
               appointed or to die, I had desired of all things to have been apprised
               thereof at such a time that I might have sent you home with such
               honourable circumstance and state and escort as befit your high
               desert; which not being vouchsafed me, and as nought will content
               you but to be there forthwith, I do what I can, and speed you
               thither on such wise as I have told you.  My lord, replied Messer
               Torello, had you said nought, you have already done enough to
               prove your goodwill towards me, and that in so high a degree as is
               quite beyond my deserts, and most assured of the truth of what you
               say shall I live and die, and so had done, had you not said it; but,
               seeing that my resolve is taken, I pray you that that, which you
               promise to do, be done speedily, for that after to-morrow I may no
               longer count on being expected.
            </p>
            <p>Saladin assured him that 'twas so ordered that he should not be
               disappointed. And on the morrow, it being his purpose to speed
               him on his journey that same night, he caused to be set up in one of
               his great halls a most goodly and sumptuous bed composed of mattresses,
               all, as was their wont, of velvet and cloth of gold, and had it
               covered with a quilt, adorned at certain intervals with enormous
               pearls, and most rare precious stones, insomuch that 'twas in after
               time accounted a priceless treasure, and furnished with two pillows
               to match it.  Which done, he bade array Messer Torello, who was
               now quite recovered, in a robe after the Saracenic fashion, the
               richest and goodliest thing of the kind that was ever seen, and wrap
               about his head, according to their wont, one of their huge turbans.
               Then, at a late hour, Saladin, attended by certain of his lords,
               entered the chamber where Messer Torello was, and seating himself
               beside him, all but wept as thus he began:  Messer Torello, the
               time is nigh at hand when you and I must part; wherefore, since
               I may neither give you my own, nor others' company (the journey
               that you are about to make not permitting it), I am come here, as
               'tis fitting, in this chamber to take my leave of you.  Wherefore,
               before I bid you adieu, I entreat you, by that friendship, that love,
               which is between us, that you forget me not, and that, if it be
               possible, when you have settled your affairs in <span class="place">Lombardy</span>, you come
               at least once, before our days are ended, to visit me, that thereby I
               may both have the delight of seeing you again, and make good that
               omission which, by reason of your haste, I must needs now make;
               and that in the meanwhile it irk thee not to visit me by letter,
               and to ask of me whatever you shall have a mind to, and be sure
               that there lives not the man whom I shall content more gladly
               than you.  Messer Torello could not refrain his tears, and so,
               with words few, and broken by his sobs, he answered that 'twas
               impossible that the Soldan's generous deeds and chivalrous character
               should ever be forgotten by him, and that without fail he would
               do as he bade him, so soon as occasion should serve him.  Whereupon
               Saladin tenderly embraced and kissed him, and with many a
               tear bade him adieu, and quitted the chamber. His lords then took
               leave of Messer Torello, and followed Saladin into the hall, where
               he had had the bed made ready.
            </p>
            <p>'Twas now late, and the necromancer being intent to hasten
               Messer Torello's transit, a physician brought him a potion, and
               having first shewn him what he was to give him by way of viaticum,
               caused him to drink it;  and not long after he fell asleep. In which
               state he was carried by Saladin's command, and laid on the goodly
               bed, whereon he set a large and fair and most sumptuous crown,
               marking it in such sort that there could be no mistake that it was
               sent by Saladin to Messer Torello's wife.  He next placed on
               Messer Torello's finger a ring, in which was set a carbuncle of
               such brilliance that it shewed as a lighted torch, and of well-nigh
               inestimable value. After which he girded on him a sword, the
               appointments of which might not readily be appraised. And therewithal
               he adorned him in front with a pendant, wherein were
               pearls, the like of which had never been seen, and not a few other
               rare jewels. And, moreover, on either side of him he set two
               vast basins of gold full of pistoles; and strings of pearls not a few,
               and rings and girdles, and other things, which 'twere tedious to
               enumerate, he disposed around him.  Which done, he kissed Messer
               Torello again, and bade the necromancer speed him on his journey.
               Whereupon, forthwith, the bed, with Messer Torello thereon, was
               borne away from before Saladin's eyes, and he and his barons
               remained conversing thereof.
            </p>
            <p>The bed, as Messer Torello had requested, had already been
               deposited in the church of <span class="place">San Piero in Ciel d'Oro</span> at <span class="place">Pavia</span>, and
               Messer Torello, with all the aforesaid jewels and ornaments upon
               and about him, was lying thereon, and still slept, when, upon the
               stroke of matins, the sacristan came into the church, light in hand,
               and presently setting eyes on the sumptuous bed, was not only
               amazed, but mightily terrified, insomuch that he turned back, and
               took to flight. Which the abbot and monks observing with no small
               surprise, asked wherefore he fled; and he told them. Whereupon:
               Oh, quoth the abbot, thou art no longer a child, nor
               yet so new to this church, that thou shouldst so lightly be appalled:
               go we now, and see who it is that has given thee this childish fright.
               So, with a blaze of torches, the abbot, attended by his monks, entered
               the church, and espied this wondrous costly bed whereon the knight
               slept, and while, hesitant and fearful, daring not to approach the bed,
               they scanned the rare and splendid jewels, it befell that, the efficacy
               of the potion being exhausted, Messer Torello awoke and heaved a
               great sigh.  Whereat the monks and the abbot quaking and crying
               out: Lord, help us! one and all took to flight.  Messer Torello,
               opening his eyes and looking about him, saw, to his no small satisfaction,
               that without a doubt he was in the very place where he had craved of
               Saladin to be; so up he sate, and taking particular note of the
               matters with which he was surrounded, accounted the magnificence
               of Saladin to exceed even the measure, great though it was, that he
               already knew.  However, he still kept quiet, save that, perceiving
               the monks in flight, and surmising the reason, he began to call the
               abbot by name, bidding him be of good courage, for that he was his
               nephew, Torello.  Whereat the abbot did but wax more terrified,
               for that he deemed Torello had been many a month dead; but, after
               a while, as he heard himself still called, sound judgment got the
               better of his fears, and making the sign of the cross, he drew nigh
               Torello;  who said to him: Father, what is't you fear? By
               God's grace I live, and hither am come back from overseas.  Whom,
               for all he had grown a long beard and was dressed in the Saracenic
               fashion, the abbot after a while recognized, and now, quite reassured,
               took by the hand, saying: Son, welcome home: then: No
               cause hast thou to marvel at our fears, he went on, seeing that
               there is never a soul in these parts but firmly believes thee to be
               dead, insomuch that I may tell thee that Madonna <span class="person">Adalieta</span>, thy wife,
               overborne by the entreaties and menaces of her kinsfolk, and against
               her will, is provided with another husband, to whom she is this
               morning to go, and all is made ready for the nuptials and the
               attendant festivities.
            </p>
            <p>Whereupon Messer Torello, being risen from the sumptuous
               bed, did the abbot and the monks wondrous cheer, and besought
               them, one and all, to tell never a soul of his return, until he had
               completed something that he had on hand. After which, having
               put the costly jewels in safe keeping, he recounted to the abbot all
               the story of his adventures to that very hour.  The abbot, rejoicing
               in his good fortune, joined with him in offering thanks to God.
               Messer Torello then asked him who might be his wife's new husband,
               and the abbot told him.  Quoth then Messer Torello:
               Before my return be known, I purpose to see how my wife will
               comport herself at the nuptials: wherefore, though 'tis not the wont
               of men of religion to go to such gatherings, I had lief that for love of
               me you arranged for us to go thither together.  The abbot answered
               that he would gladly do so, and as soon as 'twas day, he sent word
               to the bridegroom that he had thoughts of being present at his
               nuptials, accompanied by a friend; whereto the gentleman made
               answer that he was much gratified.  So, at the breakfast hour Messer
               Torello, dressed as he was, hied him with the abbot to the bridegroom's
               house, as many as saw them gazing on him with wonder,
               but none recognizing him, and the abbot giving all to understand
               that he was a Saracen sent by the Soldan as ambassador to the King
               of <span class="place">France</span>.  Messer Torello was accordingly seated at a table directly
               opposite that of his lady, whom he eyed with exceeding great delight,
               the more so that he saw that in her face which shewed him that she
               was chagrined by the nuptials. She in like manner from time to time
               bent her regard on him; howbeit, what with his long beard, and his
               foreign garb, and her firm persuasion that he was dead, she had still
               no sort of recollection of him.  However, Messer Torello at length
               deemed it time to make trial of her, whether she would remember
               him; wherefore he took the ring that the lady had given him on his
               departure, and keeping it close in the palm of his hand, he called to
               him a page that waited upon her, and said to him:  Tell the
               bride from me that 'tis the custom in my country, that, when a
               stranger, such as I, eats with a bride, like herself, at her wedding-feast,
               she, in token that he is welcome to her board, sends him the
               cup from which she herself drinks, full of wine; and when the
               stranger has drunk his fill, he closes the cup, and the bride drinks
               what is left therein.
            </p>
            <p>The page carried the message to the lady, who, being of good
               understanding and manners, and supposing him to be some very great
               man, by way of shewing that she was gratified by his presence,
               commanded
               that a gilt cup, that was on the table before her, should be
               rinsed, and filled with wine, and borne to the gentleman.  Which
               being done, Messer Torello, having privily conveyed her ring into
               his mouth, let it fall (while he drank) into the cup on such wise that
               none wist thereof; and leaving but a little wine at the bottom, closed
               the cup and returned it to the lady;  who, having taken it, that she
               might do full honour to the custom of her guest's country, lifted
               the lid, and set the cup to her mouth; whereby espying the ring,
               she thereon mutely gazed a while, and recognizing it for that which
               she had given Messer Torello on his departure, she steadfastly
               regarded the supposed stranger, whom now she also recognized.
               Whereupon well-nigh distracted, oversetting the table in front of
               her, she exclaimed: 'Tis my lord, 'tis verily Messer Torello;
               and rushing to the table at which he sate, giving never a thought to
               her apparel, or aught that was on the table, she flung herself upon
               it; and reaching forward as far as she could, she threw her arms
               about him, and hugged him; nor, for aught that any said or did,
               could she be induced to release his neck, until Messer Torello himself
               bade her forbear a while, for that she would have time enough
               to kiss him thereafter.  The lady then stood up, and for a while all
               was disorder, albeit the feast was yet more gladsome than before by
               reason of the recovery of so honourable a knight: then, at Messer
               Torello's entreaty, all were silent, while he recounted to them the
               story of his adventures from the day of his departure to that hour,
               concluding by saying that the gentleman who, deeming him to be
               dead, had taken his lady to wife, ought not to be affronted, if he,
               being alive, reclaimed her.  The bridegroom, albeit he was somewhat
               crestfallen, made answer in frank and friendly sort, that 'twas
               for Messer Torello to do what he liked with his own.  The lady
               resigned the ring and the crown that her new spouse had given her,
               and put on the ring she had taken from the cup, and likewise the
               crown sent her by the Soldan; and so, forth they hied them, and
               with full nuptial pomp wended their way to Messer Torello's house;
               and there for a great while they made merry with his late disconsolate
               friends and kinsfolk and all the citizens, who accounted his
               restoration as little short of a miracle.
            </p>
            <p>Messer Torello, having bestowed part of his rare jewels upon
               him who had borne the cost of the wedding-feast, and part on the
               abbot, and many other folk; and having by more than one messenger
               sent word of his safe home-coming and prosperous estate to Saladin,
               acknowledging himself ever his friend and vassal, lived many years
               thereafter with his worthy lady, acquitting himself yet more courteously
               than of yore.  Such, then, was the end of the troubles of
               Messer Torello and his dear lady, and such the reward of their
               cheerful and ready courtesies.
            </p>
            <p>Now some there are that strive to do offices of courtesy, and
               have the means, but do them with so ill a grace, that, ere they are
               done, they have in effect sold them at a price above their worth:
               wherefore, if no reward ensue to them thereof, neither they nor
               other folk have cause to marvel.

                  Marquis; certes, nought magnificent, but a piece of mad folly, albeit
                  there came good thereof to him in the end. The which I counsel
                  none to copy, for that great pity 'twas that it turned out well with
                  him.
               </p>
            </div>
            <p>There was in olden days a certain Marquis of <span class="place">Saluzzo</span>, Gualtieri
               by name, a young man, but head of the house, who, having
               neither wife nor child, passed his time in nought else but in hawking
               and hunting, and of taking a wife and begetting children had
               no thought; wherein he should have been accounted very wise:
               but his vassals, brooking it ill, did oftentimes entreat him to take
               a wife, that he might not die without an heir, and they be left
               without a lord; offering to find him one of such a pattern, and
               of such parentage, that he might marry with good hope, and be
               well content with the sequel.  To whom: My friends, replied
               Gualtieri, you enforce me to that which I had resolved never to do,
               seeing how hard it is to find a wife, whose ways accord well with
               one's own, and how plentiful is the supply of such as run counter
               thereto, and how grievous a life he leads who chances upon a lady
               that matches ill with him.  And to say that you think to know the
               daughters by the qualities of their fathers and mothers, and thereby--so
               you would argue--to provide me with a wife to my liking, is but
               folly; for I wot not how you may penetrate the secrets of their
               mothers so as to know their fathers; and granted that you do know
               them, daughters oftentimes resemble neither of their parents.  However,
               as you are minded to rivet these fetters upon me, I am content
               that so it be; and that I may have no cause to reproach any but
               myself, should it turn out ill, I am resolved that my wife shall be of
               my own choosing; but of this rest assured, that, no matter whom
               I choose, if she receive not from you the honour due to a lady, you
               shall prove to your great cost, how sorely I resent being thus constrained
               by your importunity to take a wife against my will.
            </p>
            <p>The worthy men replied that they were well content, so only he
               would marry without more ado.  And Gualtieri, who had long noted
               with approval the mien of a poor girl that dwelt on a farm hard by
               his house, and found her fair enough, deemed that with her he might
               pass a tolerably happy life. Wherefore he sought no further, but
               forthwith resolved to marry her; and having sent for her father, who
               was a very poor man, he contracted with him to take her to wife.
               Which done, Gualtieri assembled all the friends he had in those parts,
               and: My friends, quoth he, you were and are minded that I
               should take a wife, and rather to comply with your wishes, than for
               any desire that I had to marry, I have made up my mind to do so.
               You remember the promise you gave me, to wit, that, whomsoever I
               should take, you would pay her the honour due to a lady. Which
               promise I now require you to keep, the time being come when I am
               to keep mine.  I have found hard by here a maiden after mine own
               heart, whom I purpose to take to wife, and to bring hither to my
               house in the course of a few days. Wherefore bethink you, how
               you may make the nuptial feast splendid, and welcome her with all
               honour; that I may confess myself satisfied with your observance of
               your promise, as you will be with my observance of mine.  The
               worthy men, one and all, answered with alacrity that they were well
               content, and that, whoever she might be, they would entreat her as
               a lady, and pay her all due honour as such. After which, they all
               addressed them to make goodly and grand and gladsome celebration
               of the event, as did also Gualtieri.  He arranged for a wedding most
               stately and fair, and bade thereto a goodly number of his friends and
               kinsfolk, and great gentlemen, and others, of the neighbourhood;
               and therewithal he caused many a fine and costly robe to be cut and
               fashioned to the figure of a girl who seemed to him of the like proportions
               as the girl that he purposed to wed; and laid in store,
               besides, of girdles and rings, with a costly and beautiful crown, and
               all the other paraphernalia of a bride.
            </p>
            <p>The day that he had appointed for the wedding being come,
               about half tierce he got him to horse with as many as had come to
               do him honour, and having made all needful dispositions: Gentlemen,
               quoth he, 'tis time to go bring home the bride. And so
               away he rode with his company to the village;  where, being come
               to the house of the girl's father, they found her returning from the
               spring with a bucket of water, making all the haste she could, that
               she might afterwards go with the other women to see Gualtieri's
               bride come by. Whom Gualtieri no sooner saw, than he called her
               by her name, to wit, <span class="person">Griselda</span>, and asked her where her father was.
               To whom she modestly made answer: My lord, he is in the house.
               Whereupon Gualtieri dismounted, and having bidden the rest await
               him without, entered the cottage alone; and meeting her father,
               whose name was Giannucolo: I am come, quoth he, to wed
               <span class="person">Griselda</span>, but first of all there are some matters I would learn from
               her own lips in thy presence.  He then asked her, whether, if he
               took her to wife, she would study to comply with his wishes, and be
               not wroth, no matter what he might say or do, and be obedient,
               with not a few other questions of a like sort: to all which she
               answered, ay.  Whereupon Gualtieri took her by the hand, led her
               forth, and before the eyes of all his company, and as many other
               folk as were there, caused her to strip naked, and let bring the
               garments that he had had fashioned for her, and had her forthwith
               arrayed therein, and upon her unkempt head let set a crown;  and
               then, while all wondered: Gentlemen, quoth he, this is she
               whom I purpose to make my wife, so she be minded to have me for
               husband. Then, she standing abashed and astonied, he turned to
               her, saying: <span class="person">Griselda</span>, wilt thou have me for thy husband?  To
               whom: Ay, my lord, answered she.  And I will have thee to
               wife, said he, and married her before them all. And having set her
               upon a palfrey, he brought her home with pomp.
            </p>
            <p>The wedding was fair and stately, and had he married a daughter
               of the King of <span class="place">France</span>, the feast could not have been more splendid.
               It seemed as if, with the change of her garb, the bride had acquired
               a new dignity of mind and mien. She was, as we have said, fair of
               form and feature; and therewithal she was now grown so engaging
               and gracious and debonair, that she shewed no longer as the shepherdess,
               and the daughter of Giannucolo, but as the daughter of some noble
               lord, insomuch that she caused as many as had known her before to
               marvel. Moreover, she was so obedient and devoted to her husband,
               that he deemed himself the happiest and luckiest man in the world.
               And likewise so gracious and kindly was she to her husband's vassals,
               that there was none of them but loved her more dearly than himself,
               and was zealous to do her honour, and prayed for her welfare and
               prosperity and aggrandisement, and instead of, as erstwhile, saying
               that Gualtieri had done foolishly to take her to wife, now averred
               that he had not his like in the world for wisdom and discernment,
               for that, save to him, her noble qualities would ever have remained
               hidden under her sorry apparel and the garb of the peasant girl.
               And in short she so comported herself as in no long time to bring it
               to pass that, not only in the marquisate, but far and wide besides, her
               virtues and her admirable conversation were matter of common talk,
               and, if aught had been said to the disadvantage of her husband, when
               he married her, the judgment was now altogether to the contrary
               effect.
            </p>
            <p>She had not been long with Gualtieri before she conceived; and
               in due time she was delivered of a girl; whereat Gualtieri made great
               cheer. But, soon after, a strange humour took possession of him,
               to wit, to put her patience to the proof by prolonged and intolerable
               hard usage; wherefore he began by afflicting her with his gibes,
               putting on a vexed air, and telling her that his vassals were most
               sorely dissatisfied with her by reason of her base condition, and all
               the more so since they saw that she was a mother, and that they
               did nought but most ruefully murmur at the birth of a daughter.
               Whereto <span class="person">Griselda</span>, without the least change of countenance or sign
               of discomposure, made answer: My lord, do with me as thou
               mayst deem best for thine own honour and comfort, for well I wot
               that I am of less account than they, and unworthy of this honourable
               estate to which of thy courtesy thou hast advanced me.  By which
               answer Gualtieri was well pleased, witting that she was in no degree
               puffed up with pride by his, or any other's, honourable entreatment
               of her.  A while afterwards, having in general terms given his wife
               to understand that the vassals could not endure her daughter, he sent
               her a message by a servant. So the servant came, and: Madam,
               quoth he with a most dolorous mien, so I value my life, I must
               needs do my lord's bidding. He has bidden me take your daughter
               and . . .  He said no more, but the lady by what she heard, and
               read in his face, and remembered of her husband's words, understood
               that he was bidden to put the child to death. Whereupon she
               presently took the child from the cradle, and having kissed and blessed
               her, albeit she was very sore at heart, she changed not countenance,
               but placed it in the servant's arms, saying:  See that thou leave
               nought undone that my lord and thine has charged thee to do, but
               leave her not so that the beasts and the birds devour her, unless he
               have so bidden thee.  So the servant took the child, and told
               Gualtieri what the lady had said; and Gualtieri, marvelling at her
               constancy, sent him with the child to <span class="place">Bologna</span>, to one of his kinswomen,
               whom he besought to rear and educate the child with all
               care, but never to let it be known whose child she was.
            </p>
            <p>Soon after it befell that the lady again conceived, and in due
               time was delivered of a son, whereat Gualtieri was overjoyed. But,
               not content with what he had done, he now even more poignantly
               afflicted the lady; and one day with a ruffled mien:  Wife,
               quoth he, since thou gavest birth to this boy, I may on no wise live
               in peace with my vassals, so bitterly do they reproach me that a
               grandson of Giannucolo is to succeed me as their lord; and therefore I
               fear that, so I be not minded to be sent a packing hence, I must even
               do herein as I did before, and in the end put thee away, and take
               another wife.  The lady heard him patiently, and answered only:
               My lord, study how thou mayst content thee and best please thyself,
               and waste no thought upon me, for there is nought I desire save in so
               far as I know that 'tis thy pleasure.  Not many days after, Gualtieri,
               in like manner as he had sent for the daughter, sent for the son, and
               having made a shew of putting him to death, provided for his, as for
               the girl's, nurture at <span class="place">Bologna</span>.  Whereat the lady shewed no more
               discomposure of countenance or speech than at the loss of her
               daughter: which Gualtieri found passing strange, and inly affirmed
               that there was never another woman in the world that would have
               so done. And but that he had marked that she was most tenderly
               affectionate towards her children, while 'twas well pleasing to him, he
               had supposed that she was tired of them, whereas he knew that 'twas
               of her discretion that she so did.  His vassals, who believed that he had
               put the children to death, held him mightily to blame for his cruelty,
               and felt the utmost compassion for the lady. She, however, said
               never aught to the ladies that condoled with her on the death of her
               children, but that the pleasure of him that had begotten them was
               her pleasure likewise.
            </p>
            <p>Years not a few had passed since the girl's birth, when Gualtieri
               at length deemed the time come to put his wife's patience to the
               final proof. Accordingly, in the presence of a great company of his
               vassals he declared that on no wise might he longer brook to have
               <span class="person">Griselda</span> to wife, that he confessed that in taking her he had done a
               sorry thing and the act of a stripling, and that he therefore meant to
               do what he could to procure the Pope's dispensation to put <span class="person">Griselda</span>
               away, and take another wife: for which cause being much upbraided
               by many worthy men, he made no other answer but only that needs
               must it so be.  Whereof the lady being apprised, and now deeming
               that she must look to go back to her father's house, and perchance
               tend the sheep, as she had aforetime, and see him, to whom she
               was utterly devoted, engrossed by another woman, did inly bewail
               herself right sorely: but still with the same composed mien with
               which she had borne Fortune's former buffets, she set herself to endure
               this last outrage.  Nor was it long before Gualtieri by counterfeit
               letters, which he caused to be sent to him from <span class="place">Rome</span>, made his
               vassals believe that the Pope had thereby given him a dispensation to
               put <span class="person">Griselda</span> away, and take another wife. Wherefore, having caused
               her to be brought before him, he said to her in the presence of not a
               few:  Wife, by license granted me by the Pope, I am now free
               to put thee away, and take another wife; and, for that my forbears
               have always been great gentlemen and lords of these parts, whereas
               thine have ever been husbandmen, I purpose that thou go back
               to Giannucolo's house with the dowry that thou broughtest me;
               whereupon I shall bring home a lady that I have found, and who is
               meet to be my wife.
            </p>
            <p>'Twas not without travail most grievous that the lady, as she
               heard this announcement, got the better of her woman's nature, and
               suppressing her tears, made answer: My lord, I ever knew that
               my low degree was on no wise congruous with your nobility, and
               acknowledged that the rank I had with you was of your and God's
               bestowal, nor did I ever make as if it were mine by gift, or so esteem
               it, but still accounted it as a loan. 'Tis your pleasure to recall it,
               and therefore it should be, and is, my pleasure to render it up to you.
               So, here is your ring, with which you espoused me; take it back.
               You bid me take with me the dowry that I brought you; which to
               do will require neither paymaster on your part nor purse nor packhorse
               on mine; for I am not unmindful that naked was I when you
               first had me. And if you deem it seemly that that body in which I
               have borne children, by you begotten, be beheld of all, naked will I
               depart; but yet, I pray you, be pleased, in guerdon of the virginity
               that I brought you and take not away, to suffer me to bear hence
               upon my back a single shift--I crave no more--besides my dowry.
               There was nought of which Gualtieri was so fain as to weep; but
               yet, setting his face as a flint, he made answer: I allow thee a
               shift to thy back; so get thee hence.  All that stood by besought
               him to give her a robe, that she, who had been his wife for thirteen
               years and more, might not be seen to quit his house in so sorry and
               shameful a plight, having nought on her but a shift. But their
               entreaties went for nothing: the lady in her shift, and barefoot and
               bareheaded, having bade them adieu, departed the house, and went
               back to her father amid the tears and lamentations of all that saw
               her.  Giannucolo, who had ever deemed it a thing incredible
               that Gualtieri should keep his daughter to wife, and had looked
               for this to happen every day, and had kept the clothes that she
               had put off on the morning that Gualtieri had wedded her, now
               brought them to her; and she, having resumed them, applied herself
               to the petty drudgery of her father's house, as she had been wont,
               enduring with fortitude this cruel visitation of adverse Fortune.
            </p>
            <p>Now no sooner had Gualtieri dismissed <span class="person">Griselda</span>, than he gave his
               vassals to understand that he had taken to wife a daughter of one of
               the Counts of Panago. He accordingly made great preparations as
               for the nuptials, during which he sent for <span class="person">Griselda</span>. To whom,
               being come, quoth he:  I am bringing hither my new bride, and
               in this her first home-coming I purpose to shew her honour; and
               thou knowest that women I have none in the house that know
               how to set chambers in due order, or attend to the many other
               matters that so joyful an event requires; wherefore do thou, that
               understandest these things better than another, see to all that needs
               be done, and bid hither such ladies as thou mayst see fit, and
               receive them, as if thou wert the lady of the house, and then,
               when the nuptials are ended, thou mayst go back to thy cottage.
               Albeit each of these words pierced <span class="person">Griselda</span>'s heart like a knife,
               for that, in resigning her good fortune, she had not been able to
               renounce the love she bore Gualtieri, nevertheless: My lord, she
               made answer, I am ready and prompt to do your pleasure.  And
               so, clad in her sorry garments of coarse romagnole, she entered the
               house, which, but a little before, she had quitted in her shift, and
               addressed her to sweep the chambers, and arrange arras and cushions
               in the halls, and make ready the kitchen, and set her hand to everything,
               as if she had been a paltry serving-wench: nor did she rest
               until she had brought all into such meet and seemly trim as the
               occasion demanded.  This done, she invited in Gualtieri's name all
               the ladies of those parts to be present at his nuptials, and awaited the
               event. The day being come, still wearing her sorry weeds, but in
               heart and soul and mien the lady, she received the ladies as they
               came, and gave each a gladsome greeting.
            </p>
            <p>Now Gualtieri, as we said, had caused his children to be carefully
               nurtured and brought up by a kinswoman of his at <span class="place">Bologna</span>, which
               kinswoman was married into the family of the Counts of Panago;
               and, the girl being now twelve years old, and the loveliest creature
               that ever was seen, and the boy being about six years old, he had
               sent word to his kinswoman's husband at <span class="place">Bologna</span>, praying him to
               be pleased to come with this girl and boy of his to <span class="place">Saluzzo</span>, and to
               see that he brought a goodly and honourable company with him,
               and to give all to understand that he brought the girl to him to
               wife, and on no wisè to disclose to any, who she really was.  The
               gentleman did as the Marquis bade him, and within a few days of
               his setting forth arrived at <span class="place">Saluzzo</span> about breakfast-time with the
               girl, and her brother, and a noble company, and found all the folk of
               those parts, and much people besides, gathered there in expectation
               of Gualtieri's new bride.  Who, being received by the ladies, was
               no sooner come into the hall, where the tables were set, than <span class="person">Griselda</span>
               advanced to meet her, saying with hearty cheer: Welcome, my
               lady. So the ladies, who had with much instance, but in vain, besought
               Gualtieri, either to let <span class="person">Griselda</span> keep in another room, or at any
               rate to furnish her with one of the robes that had been hers, that she
               might not present herself in such a sorry guise before the strangers,
               sate down to table; and the service being begun,  the eyes of all were
               set on the girl, and every one said that Gualtieri had made a good
               exchange, and <span class="person">Griselda</span> joined with the rest in greatly commending
               her, and also her little brother.  And now Gualtieri, sated at last
               with all that he had seen of his wife's patience, marking that this
               new and strange turn made not the least alteration in her demeanour,
               and being well assured that 'twas not due to apathy, for he knew her
               to be of excellent understanding, deemed it time to relieve her
               of the suffering which he judged her to dissemble under a resolute
               front; and so, having called her to him in presence of them all, he
               said with a smile: And what thinkst thou of our bride?
               My lord, replied <span class="person">Griselda</span>, I think mighty well of her; and if
               she be but as discreet as she is fair--and so I deem her--I make no
               doubt but you may reckon to lead with her a life of incomparable
               felicity; but with all earnestness I entreat you, that you spare her
               those tribulations which you did once inflict upon another that was
               yours, for I scarce think she would be able to bear them, as well
               because she is younger, as for that she has been delicately nurtured,
               whereas that other had known no respite of hardship since she was
               but a little child.  Marking that she made no doubt but that the
               girl was to be his wife, and yet spoke never a whit the less sweetly,
               Gualtieri caused her to sit down beside him, and:  <span class="person">Griselda</span>,
               said he, 'tis now time that thou see the reward of thy long patience,
               and that those, who have deemed me cruel and unjust and insensate,
               should know that what I did was done of purpose aforethought, for
               that I was minded to give both thee and them a lesson, that thou
               mightst learn to be a wife, and they in like manner might learn how
               to take and keep a wife, and that I might beget me perpetual peace
               with thee for the rest of my life; whereof being in great fear, when
               I came to take a wife, lest I should be disappointed, I therefore, to
               put the matter to the proof, did, and how sorely thou knowest, harass
               and afflict thee.  And since I never knew thee either by deed or by
               word to deviate from my will, I now, deeming myself to have of
               thee that assurance of happiness which I desired, am minded to
               restore to thee at once all that, step by step, I took from thee, and
               by extremity of joy to compensate the tribulations that I inflicted
               on thee.  Receive, then, this girl, whom thou supposest to be my
               bride, and her brother, with glad heart, as thy children and mine.
               These are they, whom by thee and many another it has long been
               supposed that I did ruthlessly to death, and I am thy husband, that
               loves thee more dearly than aught else, deeming that other there is
               none that has the like good cause to be well content with his wife.
            </p>
            <p>Which said, he embraced and kissed her; and then, while she
               wept for joy, they rose and hied them there where sate the daughter,
               all astonied to hear the news, whom, as also her brother, they tenderly
               embraced, and explained to them, and many others that stood
               by, the whole mystery.  Whereat the ladies, transported with delight,
               rose from table and betook them with <span class="person">Griselda</span> to a chamber,
               and, with better omen, divested her of her sorry garb, and arrayed
               her in one of her own robes of state; and so, in guise of a lady
               (howbeit in her rags she had shewed as no less) they led her back
               into the hall.  Wondrous was the cheer which there they made
               with the children; and, all overjoyed at the event, they revelled and
               made merry amain, and prolonged the festivities for several days;
               and very discreet they pronounced Gualtieri, albeit they censured as
               intolerably harsh the probation to which he had subjected <span class="person">Griselda</span>,
               and most discreet beyond all compare they accounted <span class="person">Griselda</span>.
            </p>
            <p>Some days after, the Count of Panago returned to <span class="place">Bologna</span>, and
               Gualtieri took Giannucolo from his husbandry, and established him
               in honour as his father-in-law, wherein to his great solace he lived
               for the rest of his days. Gualtieri himself, having mated his daughter
               with a husband of high degree, lived long and happily thereafter with
               <span class="person">Griselda</span>, to whom he ever paid all honour.
            </p>
            <p>Now what shall we say in this case but that even into the cots of
               the poor the heavens let fall at times spirits divine, as into the palaces
               of kings souls that are fitter to tend hogs than to exercise lordship over
               men? Who but <span class="person">Griselda</span> had been able, with a countenance not only
               tearless, but cheerful, to endure the hard and unheard-of trials to which
               Gualtieri subjected her?  Who perhaps might have deemed himself
               to have made no bad investment, had he chanced upon one, who,
               having been turned out of his house in her shift, had found means so
               to dust the pelisse of another as to get herself thereby a fine robe.

         <div class="conclusion">
            <h3 class="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
            <p>So ended <span class="person">Dioneo</span>'s story, whereof the ladies, diversely inclining,
               one to censure where another found matter for commendation, had
               discoursed not a little, when the king, having glanced at the sky,
               and marked that the sun was now low, insomuch that 'twas nigh the
               vesper hour, still keeping his seat, thus began:  Exquisite my
               ladies, as, methinks, you wot, 'tis not only in minding them of
               the past and apprehending the present that the wit of mortals
               consists; but by one means or the other to be able to foresee the
               future is by the sages accounted the height of wisdom.  Now,
               to-morrow, as you know, 'twill be fifteen days since, in quest of
               recreation and for the conservation of our health and life, we, shunning
               the dismal and dolorous and afflicting spectacles that have ceased
               not in our city since this season of pestilence began, took our departure
               from <span class="place">Florence</span>.  Wherein, to my thinking, we have done
               nought that was not seemly; for, if I have duly used my powers of
               observation, albeit some gay stories, and of a kind to stimulate
               concupiscence,
               have here been told, and we have daily known no lack
               of dainty dishes and good wine, nor yet of music and song, things,
               one and all, apt to incite weak minds to that which is not seemly,
               neither on your part, nor on ours, have I marked deed or word, or
               aught of any kind, that called for reprehension;  but, by what I have
               seen and heard, seemliness and the sweet intimacy of brothers and
               sisters have ever reigned among us. Which, assuredly, for the honour
               and advantage which you and I have had thereof, is most grateful to
               me.  Wherefore, lest too long continuance in this way of life might
               beget some occasion of weariness, and that no man may be able to
               misconstrue our too long abidance here, and as we have all of us had
               our day's share of the honour which still remains in me, I should
               deem it meet, so you be of like mind, that we now go back whence
               we came:  and that the rather that our company, the bruit whereof
               has already reached divers others that are in our neighbourhood, might
               be so increased that all our pleasure would be destroyed. And so, if
               my counsel meet with your approval, I will keep the crown I have
               received of you until our departure, which, I purpose, shall be tomorrow
               morning. Should you decide otherwise, I have already
               determined whom to crown for the ensuing day.
            </p>
            <p>Much debate ensued among the ladies and young men; but in
               the end they approved the king's proposal as expedient and seemly;
               and resolved to do even as he had said. The king therefore
               summoned the seneschal; and having conferred with him of the
               order he was to observe on the morrow, he dismissed the company
               until supper-time.  So, the king being risen, the ladies and the rest
               likewise rose, and betook them, as they were wont, to their several
               diversions. Supper-time being come, they supped with exceeding
               great delight. Which done, they addressed them to song and music
               and dancing; and, while <span class="person">Lauretta</span> was leading a dance, the king bade
               <span class="person">Fiammetta</span> give them a song; whereupon <span class="person">Fiammetta</span> right debonairly
               sang on this wise:
            </p>
            <div class="song">So came but Love, and brought no jealousy,
               So blithe, I wot, as I,
               Dame were there none, be she whoe'er she be.If youth's fresh, lusty pride
               May lady of her lover well content,
               Or valour's just renown,
               Hardihood, prowess tried,
               Wit, noble mien, discourse most excellent,
               And of all grace the crown;
               That she am I, who, fain for love to swoun,
               There where my hope doth lie
               These several virtues all conjoined do see.But, for that I less wise
               Than me no whit do other dames discern,
               Trembling with sore dismay,
               I still the worst surmise,
               Deeming their hearts with the same flame to burn
               That of mine maketh prey:
               Wherefore of him that is my hope's one stay
               Disconsolate I sigh,
               Yea mightily, and daily do me dree.If but my lord as true
               As worthy to be loved I might approve,
               I were not jealous then:
               But, for that charmer new
               Doth all too often gallant lure to love,
               Forsworn I hold all men,
               And sick at heart I am, of death full fain;
               Nor lady doth him eye,
               But I do quake, lest she him wrest from me.'Fore God, then, let each she
               List to my prayer, nor e'er in my despite
               Such grievous wrong essay;
               For should there any be
               That by or speech or mien's allurements light
               Of him to rob me may
               Study or plot, I, witting, shall find way,
               My beauty it aby!
               To cause her sore lament such frenesie.
            </div>
            <p>As soon as <span class="person">Fiammetta</span> had ended her song, <span class="person">Dioneo</span>, who was
               beside her, said with a laugh: Madam, 'twould be a great courtesy
               on your part to do all ladies to wit, who he is, that he be not stolen
               from you in ignorance, seeing that you threaten such dire resentment.
               Several other songs followed; and it being then nigh upon
               midnight, all, as the king was pleased to order, betook them to rest.
               With the first light of the new day they rose, and, the seneschal
               having already conveyed thence all their chattels, they, following the
               lead of their discreet king, hied them back to <span class="place">Florence</span>; and in Santa
               Maria Novella, whence they had set forth, the three young men
               took leave of the seven ladies, and departed to find other diversions
               elsewhere, while the ladies in due time repaired to their homes.
