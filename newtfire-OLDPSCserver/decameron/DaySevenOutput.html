            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>Fled was now each star from the eastern sky, save only that
               which we call Lucifer, which still glowed in the whitening dawn, when uprose the
               seneschal, and with a goodly baggage-train hied him to the Ladies' Vale, there to
               make all
               things ready according to the ordinance and commandment of the king. Nor was it
               long after his departure that the king rose, being awaked by the stir and bustle that
               the
               servants made in lading the horses, and being risen he likewise roused all the ladies
               and
               the other gallants; and so, when as yet 'twas scarce clear daybreak, they all
               took the road; nor seemed it to them that the nightingales and the other birds had
               ever
               chanted so blithely as that morning. By which choir they were attended to the Ladies'
               Vale, where they were greeted by other warblers not a few, that seemed rejoiced at
               their
               arrival. Roving about the vale, and surveying its beauties afresh, they rated
               them higher than on the previous day, as indeed the hour was more apt to shew them
               forth. Then with good wine and comfits they broke their fast, and, that they
               might not lag behind the songsters, they fell a singing, whereto the vale responded,
               ever
               echoing their strains; nor did the birds, as minded not to be beaten, fail to swell
               the
               chorus with notes of unwonted sweetness. However, breakfast-time came, and
               then, the tables being laid under a living canopy of trees, and beside other goodly
               trees
               that fringed the little lake, they sat them down in order as to the king seemed meet.
               So
               they took their meal, glancing from time to time at the lake, where the fish
               darted to and fro in multitudinous shoals, which afforded not only delight to their
               eyes
               but matter for converse. Breakfast ended, and the tables
               removed, they fell a singing again more blithely than before. After which,
               there being set, in divers places about the little vale, beds which the discreet seneschal
               had duly furnished and equipped within and without with store of French coverlets,
               and
               other bedgear, all, that were so minded, had leave of the king to go to sleep, and
               those
               that cared not to sleep might betake them, as each might choose, to any of their wonted
               diversions. But, all at length being risen, and the time for addressing them to
               the story-telling being come, the king had carpets spread on the sward no great way
               from
               the place where they had breakfasted; and, all having sat them down beside the lake,
               he
               bade <span class="person">Emilia</span> begin; which, blithe and smiling, <span class="person">Emilia</span> did on this wise.

            <p>Gianni Lotteringhi hears a knocking at his door at night: he
               awakens his wife, who persuaaes him that 'tis the
               bogey, which they fall to exorcising with a prayer; whereupon the knocking

               <p>My lord, glad indeed had I been, that, saving your good
                  pleasure, some other than I had had precedence of discourse upon so goodly a theme
                  as this
                  of which we are to speak: I doubt I am but chosen to teach others confidence; but,
                  such
                  being your will, I will gladly obey it. And my endeavour shall be, dearest
                  ladies, to tell you somewhat that may be serviceable to you in the future: for, if
                  you
                  are, as I am, timorous, and that most especially of the bogey, which, God wot, I know
                  not
                  what manner of thing it may be, nor yet have found any that knew, albeit we are all
                  alike
                  afraid of it, you may learn from this my story how to put it to flight, should it
                  intrude
                  upon you, with a holy, salutary and most efficacious orison.
               </p>
            </div>
            <p>There dwelt of yore at
               <span class="place">Florence</span>, in the quarter of <span class="place">San Pancrazio</span>, a master-spinner, Gianni Lotteringhi by name,
               one that had prospered in his business, but had little understanding of aught else;
               insomuch that being somewhat of a simpleton, he had many a time been chosen leader
               of the
               band of laud-singers of <span class="place">Santa Maria Novella</span>, and had charge of their school; and not a few
               like offices had he often served, upon which he greatly plumed himself. Howbeit, 'twas
               all
               for no other reason than that, being a man of substance, he gave liberal doles to
               the
               friars; who, for that they got thereof, this one hose, another a cloak, and a
               third a hood, would teach him good orisons, or give him the paternoster in the vernacular,
               or the chant of St. Alexis, or the lament of St. Bernard, or the laud of Lady
               Matilda, or the like sorry stuff, which he greatly prized, and guarded with
               jealous care, deeming them all most conducive to the salvation of his soul.
            </p>
            <p>Now our
               simple master-spinner had a most beautiful wife, and amorous withal, her name Monna
               Tessa. Daughter she was of Mannuccio dalla Cuculla, and not a little knowing and
               keen-witted; and being enamoured of Federigo di Neri Pegolotti, a handsome and lusty
               gallant, as he also of her, she, knowing her husband's simplicity, took counsel with
               her
               maid, and arranged that Federigo should come to chat with her at a right goodly
               pleasure-house that the said Gianni had at <span class="place">Camerata</span>, where she was wont to pass the
               summer, Gianni coming now and again to sup and sleep, and going back in the
               morning to his shop, or, maybe, to his laud-singers. Federigo, who desired
               nothing better, went up there punctually on the appointed day about vespers, and as
               the
               evening passed without Gianni making his appearance, did most comfortably, and to
               his no
               small satisfaction, sup and sleep with the lady, who lying in his arms taught him
               that
               night some six of her husband's lauds. But, as neither she nor Federigo was
               minded that this beginning should also be the end of
               their intercourse, and that it might not be needful for the maid to go each time to
               make
               the assignation with him, they came to the following understanding; to wit,
               that as often as he came and went between the house and an estate that he had a little
               higher up, he should keep an eye on a vineyard that was beside the house, where he
               would
               see an ass's head stuck on one of the poles of the vineyard, and as often as he observed
               the muzzle turned towards <span class="place">Florence</span>, he might visit her without any sort of misgiving; and
               if he found not the door open, he was to tap it thrice, and she would open it; and
               when he
               saw the muzzle of the ass's head turned towards <span class="place">Fiesole</span>, he was to keep away, for then
               Gianni would be there.
               Following which plan, they forgathered not seldom: 
               but on one of
               these evenings, when Federigo was to sup with Monna Tessa on two fat capons that she
               had
               boiled, it so chanced that Gianni arrived there unexpectedly and very late, much to
               the
               lady's chagrin: so she had a little salt meat boiled apart, on which she supped with
               her
               husband; and the maid by her orders carried the two boiled capons laid in a
               spotless napkin with plenty of fresh eggs and a bottle of good wine into the garden,
               to
               which there was access otherwise than from the house, and where she was wont
               at times to sup with Federigo; and there the maid set them down at the foot of a
               peach-tree, that grew beside a lawn. But in her vexation she forgot to tell the
               maid to wait till Federigo should come, and let him know that Gianni was there, and
               he
               must take his supper in the
               garden: and she and Gianni and the maid were scarce gone to bed, when Federigo
               came and tapped once at the door, which being hard by the bedroom, Gianni heard the
               tap,
               as did also the lady, albeit, that Gianni might have no reason to suspect her, she
               feigned
               to be asleep. Federigo waited a little, and then gave a second tap; whereupon,
               wondering what it might mean, Gianni nudged his wife, saying: Tessa, dost hear what I
               hear? Methinks some one has tapped at our door. The lady, who had heard the
               noise much better than he, feigned to wake up, and: How? what sayst thou? quoth
               she. I say, replied Gianni, that, meseems, some one has tapped at our
               door. Tapped at it? quoth the lady. Alas, my Gianni, wottest thou
               not what that is? 'Tis the
               bogey, which for some nights past has so terrified me as never was,
               insomuch that I never hear it but I pop my head under the clothes and venture not
               to put
               it out again until 'tis broad day. Come, come, wife, quoth Gianni,
               if such it is, be not alarmed; for before we got into bed I repeated the Te
               lucis, the
               Intemerata, and divers other good orisons, besides which I made the
               sign of the cross in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit at each corner of
               the
               bed; wherefore we need have no fear that it may avail to hurt us, whatever be its
               power. The lady, lest Federigo, perchance suspecting a rival, should take
               offence, resolved to get up, and let him understand that Gianni was there: so she
               said to
               her husband: Well, well; so sayst thou; but I for my part shall never deem myself safe
               and secure, unless we exorcise it, seeing that thou art here. Oh!
               said Gianni, and how does one exorcise it? That, quoth the lady,
               I know right well; for t'other day, when I went to <span class="place">Fiesole</span> for the pardoning, one of
               those anchoresses, the saintliest creature, my Gianni, God be my witness, knowing
               how much
               afraid I am of the bogey, taught me a holy and salutary orison, which she said she
               had
               tried many a time before she was turned anchoress, and always with success. God
               wot, I should never have had courage to try it alone; but as thou art here, I propose
               that
               we go exorcise it together. Gianni made answer that he was
               quite of the same mind; so up they got, and stole to the door, on the outside of which
               Federigo, now suspicious, was still waiting. And as soon as they were there: Now,
               quoth the lady to Gianni, thou wilt spit, when I tell thee. Good,
               said Gianni. Whereupon the lady began her orison, saying:
            </p>
            <p>      	 Bogey,
               	bogey that goest by night, Tail erect, thou cam'st, tail erect, take thy flight:
               	Hie thee to the garden, and the great peach before, Grease upon grease, and
               	droppings five score Of my hen shalt thou find: Set the flask thy lips to,
               	Then away like the wind, And no scathe unto me or my Gianni do. And when she
               	had done: Now, Gianni, quoth she, spit: and Gianni spat.
            </p>
            <p>There was no more room for jealousy in Federigo's mind as he heard all this
               	from without; nay, for all his disappointment, he was like to burst with
               	suppressed laughter, and when Gianni spat, he muttered under his breath: Now
               	out with thy teeth. The lady, having after this fashion thrice
               	exorcised the bogey, went back to bed with her husband. Federigo,
               	disappointed of the supper that he was to have had with her, and apprehending the
               	words of the orison aright, hied him to the garden, and having found the two
               	capons and the wine and the eggs at the foot of the peach-tree, took them home
               	with him, and supped very comfortably. And many a hearty laugh had he and the lady
               	over the exorcism during their subsequent intercourse.
            </p>
            <p>Now, true it is that
               	some say that the lady had in fact turned the ass's head towards <span class="place">Fiesole</span>, but that
               	a husbandman, passing through the vineyard, had given it a blow with his stick,
               	whereby it had swung round, and remained fronting <span class="place">Florence</span>, and so it was that
               	Federigo thought that he was invited, and came to the house, and that
               	the lady's orison was on this wise:
               		  Bogey, a God's name, away thee hie, For whoe'er turned the ass's head, 'twas not
               I;
               	  Another it was, foul fall his eyne; And here am I with Gianni mine.
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore Federigo was fain to take himself off, having neither slept nor
               supped.
            </p>
            <p>But a neighbour of mine, a lady well advanced in years, tells me that, by
               what she heard when she was a girl, both stories are true; but that the latter concerned
               not Gianni Lotteringhi but one Gianni di Nello, that lived at <span class="place">Porta San Piero</span>, and was no
               less a numskull than Gianni Lotteringhi. Wherefore, dear my ladies, you are at
               liberty to choose which exorcism you prefer, or take both if you like.  They are both
               of
               extraordinary and approved virtue in such cases, as you have heard: get them by heart,
               therefore, and they may yet stand you in good stead.

            <p>'Tis no long time since at <span class="place">Naples</span> a poor man, a mason by craft, took to wife a fair and
               amorous maiden--Peronella was her name--who eked out by spinning what her husband
               made by
               his craft; and so the pair managed as best they might on very slender
               means. And as chance would have it, one of the gallants of the city, taking

               her, and by this means and that so prevailed that he won her to accord him her
               intimacy. Their times of forgathering they concerted as follows: to wit, that,
               her husband being wont to rise betimes of a morning to go to work or seek for work,
               the
               gallant was to be where he might see him go forth, and, the street where she dwelt,
               which
               is called Avorio, being scarce inhabited, was to come
               into the house as soon as her husband was well out of it; and so times not a few they
               did. But on one of these occasions it befell that, the good man being gone
               forth, and Giannello Sirignario--such was the gallant's name--being come into the
               house,
               and being with Peronella, after a while, back came the good man, though 'twas not
               his wont
               to return until the day was done; and finding the door locked, he knocked, and after
               knocking, he fell a saying to himself: O God, praised be Thy name forever; for
               that, albeit Thou hast ordained that I be poor, at least Thou hast accorded me the
               consolation of a good and honest girl for wife. Mark what haste she made to shut the
               door
               when I was gone forth, that none else might enter to give her trouble.
            </p>
            <p>Now
               Peronella knew by his knock that 'twas her husband; wherefore: Alas, Giannello
               mine, quoth she, I am a dead woman, for lo, here is my husband, foul fall him! come
               back! What it may import, I know not, for he is never wont to come back at this hour;
               perchance he caught sight of thee as thou camest in. However, for the love of
               God, be it as it may, get thee into this tun that thou seest here, and I will go open
               to
               him, and we shall see what is the occasion of this sudden return this morning.
               So Giannello forthwith got into the tun, and Peronella went to the door, and
               let in her husband, and gave him black looks, saying: This is indeed a surprise that
               thou art back so soon this morning! By what I see thou hast a mind to make this a
               holiday,
               that thou returnest tools in hand; if so, what are we to live on? whence shall we
               get
               bread to eat? Thinkest thou I will let thee pawn my gown and other bits of
               clothes? Day and night I do nought else but spin, insomuch that the flesh is fallen
               away
               from my nails, that at least I may have oil enough to keep our lamp
               alight. Husband, husband, there is never a woman in the neighbourhood but
               marvels and mocks at me, that I am at such labour and pains; and thou comest home
               to me
               with thy hands hanging idle, when thou shouldst be at work. Which said, she
               fell a weeping and repeating: Alas, alas, woe's me, in what evil hour was I born? in
               what luckless moment came I hither, I, that might have had so goodly a young man,
               and I
               would not, to take up with one that bestows never a thought on her whom he has made
               his
               wife? Other women have a good time with their lovers, and never a one have we
               here but has two or three; they take their pleasure, and make their husbands believe
               that
               the moon is the sun; and I, alas! for that I am an honest woman, and have no such
               casual
               amours, I suffer, and am hard bested: I know not why I provide not myself with one
               of
               these lovers, as others do. Give good heed, husband, to what I say: were I
               disposed to dishonour thee, I were at no loss to find the man: for here are gallants
               enough, that love me, and court me, and have sent me many an offer of money--no stint--or
               dresses or jewels, should I prefer them; but my pride would never suffer it, because
               I was
               not born of a woman of that sort: and now thou comest home to me when thou oughtest
               to be
               at work.
            </p>
            <p>Whereto the husband: Wife, wife, for God's sake distress not
               thyself: thou shouldst give me credit for knowing what manner of woman thou art, as
               indeed
               I have partly seen this morning. True it is that I went out to work; but 'tis plain
               that
               thou knowest not, as indeed I knew not, that to-day 'tis the feast of San
               Galeone, and a holiday, and that is why I am come home at this hour; but nevertheless
               I
               have found means to provide us with bread for more than a month; for I have sold to
               this
               gentleman, whom thou seest with me, the tun, thou wottest of, seeing that it has
               encumbered the house so long, and he will give me five gigliats for it.
               Quoth then Peronella: And all this but adds to my trouble: thou, that art a
               man, and goest abroad, and shouldst know affairs, hast sold for five gigliats a tun,
               which
               I, that am but a woman, and was scarce ever out of doors, have, for that it took up
               so
               much room in the house, sold for seven gigliats to a good man, that but now, as thou
               cam'st back, got therein, to see if 'twere sound. So hearing, the husband
               was overjoyed, and said to the man that was come to take it away; Good man,
               I wish thee Godspeed; for, as thou hearest, my wife has sold the tun for seven gigliats,
               whereas thou gavest me only five. Whereupon: So be it, said the good
               man, and took himself off.  Then said Peronella to her husband: Now, as thou
               art here, come
               up, and arrange the matter with the good man.
            </p>
            <p>Now Giannello, who, meanwhile,
               had been all on the alert to discover if there were aught he had to fear or be on
               his
               guard against, no sooner heard Peronella's last words, than he sprang out of the tun,
               and
               feigning to know nought of her husband's return, began thus: Where art thou, good
               dame? Whereto the husband, coming up, answered: Here am I: what wouldst
               thou of me? Quoth Giannello: And who art thou? I would speak with the
               lady with whom I struck the bargain for this tun. Then said the good
               man: Have no fear, you can deal with me; for I am her husband.
               Quoth then Giannello: The tun seems to me sound enough; but I think you must
               have let the lees remain in it; for 'tis all encrusted with I know not what that is
               so
               dry, that I cannot raise it with the nail; wherefore I am not minded to take it unless
               I
               first see it scoured. Whereupon Peronella: To be sure: that shall not
               hinder the bargain; my husband will scour it clean. And: Well and
               good, said the husband.
            </p>
            <p>So he laid down his tools, stripped himself to his
               vest, sent for a light and a rasp, and was in the tun, and scraping away, in a trice.
               Whereupon Peronella, as if she were curious to see what he did, thrust her head
               into the vent of the tun, which was of no great size, and
               therewithal one of her arms up to the shoulder, and fell a saying:
               Scrape here, and here, and there too, and look, there is a bit left
               here. So, she being in this posture, directing and admonishing her
               husband, Giannello, who had not, that morning, fully satisfied his desire, when the
               husband arrived, now seeing that as he would, he might not, brought his mind to his
               circumstances, and resolved to take his pleasure as he might: wherefore he made
               up to the lady, who completely blocked the vent of the tun; and even on such wise
               as on
               the open champaign the wild and lusty horses do amorously assail the mares of Parthia,
               he
               sated his youthful appetite; and so it was that almost at the same moment that he
               did so,
               and was off, the tun was scoured, the husband came forth of it, and Peronella
               withdrew her head from the vent, and turning to
               Giannello, said: Take this light, good man, and see if 'tis scoured to thy mind.
               Whereupon Giannello, looking into the tun, said that 'twas in good trim, and
               that he was well content, and paid the husband the seven gigliats, and caused him
               carry
               the tun to his house.

                  	story being ended, the king called for one from Elisa, who, all obedience, thus began:

            </div>
            <div class="frame">
               <p>Debonair my ladies, we heard from <span class="person">Emilia</span> how the bogey is exorcised, and it
                  	brought to my mind a story of another incantation: 'tis not indeed so good a story
                  as
                  	hers; but, as no other,
                  	germane to our theme, occurs to me at present, I will relate it.
               </p>
            </div>
            <p>You are to know,
               then, that there dwelt aforetime at <span class="place">Siena</span> a young man, right gallant and of honourable
               family, his name Rinaldo; who, being in the last degree enamoured of one of his
               neighbours, a most beautiful gentlewoman and the wife of a rich man, was not without
               hopes
               that, if he could but find means to speak with her privately, he might have of her
               all
               that he desired; but seeing no way, and the lady being pregnant, he cast about
               how he might become her child's godfather. Wherefore, having ingratiated himself with
               her
               husband, he broached the matter to him in as graceful a manner as he might; and 'twas
               arranged. So Rinaldo, being now godfather to Madonna <span class="person">Agnesa</span>'s child, and having
               a more colourable pretext for speaking to her, took courage, and told her in words
               that
               message of his heart which she had long before read in his eyes; but though 'twas
               not
               displeasing to the lady to hear, it availed him but little.
            </p>
            <p>Now not long afterwards
               it so befell that, whatever may have been his reason, Rinaldo betook him to friarage;
               and
               whether it was that he found good pasture therein, or what not, he persevered
               in that way of life. And though for a while after he was turned friar, he laid
               aside the love he bore his gossip, and certain other vanities, yet in course of time,
               without putting off the habit, he resumed them, and began to take a pride in his
               appearance, and to go dressed in fine clothes, and to be quite the trim gallant, and
               to
               compose songs and sonnets and ballades, and to sing them, and to make a brave shew
               in all
               else that pertained to his new character.  But why enlarge upon our Fra
               Rinaldo, of whom we speak?  what friars are there that do not the like? Ah! opprobrium
               of
               a corrupt
               world! Sleek-faced and sanguine, daintily clad, dainty in all their
               accessories, they ruffle it shamelessly before the eyes of all, shewing
               not as doves but as insolent cocks with raised crest and swelling bosom, and,
               what is worse (to say nought of the vases full of electuaries and unguents, the boxes
               packed with divers comfits, the pitchers and phials of artificial waters, and oils,
               the
               flagons brimming with Malmsey and Greek and other wines of finest quality, with which
               their cells are so packed that they shew not as the cells of friars, but rather as
               apothecaries' or perfumers' shops), they blush not to be known to be gouty, flattering
               themselves that other folk wot not that long fasts and many of them, and coarse fare
               and
               little of it, and sober living, make men lean and thin and for the most part healthy;
               or if any malady come thereof, at any rate 'tis not the gout, the wonted remedy
               for which is chastity and all beside that
               belongs to the regimen of a humble friar. They flatter themselves, too, that
               others wot not that over and above the meagre diet, long vigils and orisons and strict
               discipline ought to mortify men and make them pale, and that neither St. Dominic nor
               St. Francis went clad in stuff dyed in grain or any other goodly garb, but in coarse
               woollen habits innocent of the dyer's art, made to keep out the cold, and not for
               shew. To
               which matters 'twere well God had a care, no less than to the souls of the simple
               folk by
               whom our friars are nourished.
            </p>
            <p>Fra Rinaldo, then, being come back to his first
               affections, took to visiting his gossip very frequently; and gaining confidence, began
               with more insistence than before to solicit her to that which he craved of
               her. So, being much urged, the good lady, to whom Fra Rinaldo, perhaps, seemed
               now more handsome than of yore, had
               recourse one day, when she felt herself unusually hard pressed by him, to the
               common expedient of all that would fain concede what is asked of them, and said: Oh!
               but Fra Rinaldo, do friars then do this sort of thing? Madam,
               replied Fra Rinaldo, when I divest myself of this habit, which I shall do easily
               enough, you will see that I am a man furnished as other men, and no friar.
               Whereto with a truly comical air the lady made answer: Alas! woe's me!  you
               are my child's godfather: how might it be? nay, but 'twere a very great mischief;
               and many
               a time I have heard that 'tis a most heinous sin; and without a doubt, were it not
               so, I
               would do as you wish. If, said Fra Rinaldo, you forego it for
               such a scruple as this, you are a fool for your pains. I say not that 'tis no sin;
               but
               there is no sin so great but God pardons it, if one repent. Now tell me: whether is
               more
               truly father to your son, I that held him at the font, or your husband that begot
               him?
               My husband, replied the lady. 
               Sooth say you, returned
               the friar, and does not your husband lie with you? Why, yes, said
               the lady. Then, rejoined the friar, I that am less truly your son's
               father than your husband, ought also to lie with you, as does your husband.
               The lady was no logician, and needed little to sway her: she therefore believed
               or feigned to believe that what the friar said was true. So: Who might avail to answer
               your words of wisdom? quoth she; and presently forgot the godfather in the lover, and
               complied with
               his desires. Nor had they begun their course to end it forthwith: but under cover
               of the
               friar's sponsorship, which set them more at ease, as it rendered them less open to
               suspicion, they forgathered again and again.
            </p>
            <p>But on one of these occasions it so
               befell that Fra Rinaldo, being come to the lady's house, where he espied none else
               save a
               very
               pretty and dainty little maid that waited on the lady, sent his companion
               away with her into the pigeon-house, there to teach her the paternoster, while he
               and the
               lady, holding her little boy by the hand, went into the bedroom, locked themselves
               in, got
               them on to a divan that was there, and began to disport them. And while thus
               they sped the time, it chanced that the father returned, and, before any was ware
               of him,
               was at the bedroom door, and knocked, and called the lady by her
               name. Whereupon: 'Tis as much as my life is worth, quoth Madonna <span class="person">Agnesa</span>;
               lo, here is my husband; and the occasion of our intimacy cannot but be now
               apparent to him. Sooth say you, returned Fra Rinaldo, who was
               undressed, that is to say, had thrown off his habit and hood, and was in his tunic;
               if
               I had but my habit and hood on me in any sort, 'twould be another matter; but if you
               let
               him in, and he find me thus, 'twill not be possible to put any face on it.
               But with an inspiration as happy as sudden: Now get them on you, quoth
               the lady; and when you have them on, take your godson in your arms, and give good heed
               to what I shall say to him, that your words may accord with mine; and leave the rest
               to
               me.
            </p>
            <p>The good man was still knocking, when his wife made answer:
               Coming, coming. And so up she got, and put on a cheerful
               countenance and hied her to the door, and opened it and said: Husband mine: well indeed
               was it for us that in came Fra Rinaldo, our sponsor; 'twas God that sent him to us;
               for in
               sooth, but for that, we had to-day lost our boy. Which the poor simpleton
               almost swooned to hear; and: How so? quoth he. O husband mine,
               replied the lady, he was taken but now, all of a sudden, with a fainting fit, so that I
               thought he was dead: and what to do or say I knew not, had not Fra Rinaldo, our sponsor,
               come just in the nick of time, and set him on his shoulder, and said: 'Gossip, 'tis
               that
               he has worms in his body, and getting, as they do, about the heart, they might only
               too
               readily be the death of him; but fear not; I will say a charm that will kill them
               all; and
               before I take my leave, you will see your boy as whole as you ever saw him.'
               And because to say certain of the prayers thou shouldst have been with us, and
               the maid
               knew not where to find thee, he caused his companion to say them at the top of the
               house,
               and he and I came in here. And for that 'tis not meet for any but the boy's
               mother to assist at such a service, that we might not be troubled with any one else,
               we
               locked the door; and he yet has him in his arms; and I doubt not that he only waits
               till
               his companion have said his prayers, and then the charm will be complete; for the
               boy is
               already quite himself again.
            </p>
            <p>The good simple soul, taking all this for sooth,
               and overwrought by the love he bore his son, was entirely without suspicion of the
               trick
               his wife was playing him, and heaving a great sigh, said: I will go look for him.
               Nay, replied the wife, go not: thou wouldst spoil the
               efficacy of the charm: wait here; I will go see if thou mayst safely go; and will
               call
               thee.
            </p>
            <p>Whereupon Fra Rinaldo, who had heard all that passed, and was in his
               canonicals, and quite at his ease, and had the boy in his arms, having made sure that
               all
               was as it should be, cried out: Gossip, do I not hear the father's voice out there?
               Ay indeed, Sir, replied the simpleton. Come in then,
               said Fra Rinaldo. So in came the simpleton. Whereupon quoth Fra Rinaldo: I restore to
               you your boy made whole by the grace of God, whom but now I scarce thought you would
               see
               alive at vespers. You will do well to have his image fashioned in wax, not less than
               life-size, and set it for a thanksgiving to God, before the statue of Master St. Ambrose,
               by whose merits you have this favour of God.
            </p>
            <p>The boy, catching sight of his
               father, ran to him with joyous greetings, as little children are wont; and the father,
               taking him in his arms, and weeping as if he were restored to him from the grave,
               fell by turns a kissing him and thanking his godfather, that he had cured
               him. Fra Rinaldo's companion, who had taught the maid not one paternoster only,
               but peradventure four or more, and by giving her a little purse of white thread that
               a nun
               had given him, had made her his devotee, no sooner heard Fra Rinaldo call the simpleton
               into his wife's room, than he stealthily got him to a place whence he might see and
               hear
               what was going on. Observing that the affair was now excellently arranged, he came
               down,
               and entered the chamber, saying: Fra Rinaldo, those four prayers that you bade me say,
               I have said them all. Then well done, my brother, quoth Fra Rinaldo,
               well-breathed must thou be. For my part, I had but said two, when my gossip came in;
               but what with thy
               travail and mine, God of His grace has vouchsafed us the healing or the boy.
               The simpleton then had good wine and comfits brought in, and did the honours to
               the godfather and his companion in such sort as their occasions did most demand. He
               then
               ushered them forth of the house, commending them to God; and without delay had the
               waxen
               image made, and directed it to be set up with the others in front of the statue of
               St.
               Ambrose, not, be it understood, St. Ambrose of <span class="place">Milan</span>.The statue would doubtless be
               that of St.  Ambrose of <span class="place">Siena</span>, of the Dominican Order.

            <p>Know, then, that there dwelt aforetime at <span class="place">Arezzo</span> a rich man, Tofano
               by name, who took to wife Monna Ghita, a lady exceeding fair, of whom, for what cause
               he
               knew not, he presently grew jealous.  Whereof the lady being ware, waxed resentful,
               and
               having on divers occasions demanded of him the reason of his jealousy, and gotten
               from him
               nought precise, but only generalities and trivialities, resolved at last to give him
               cause
               enough to die of that evil which without cause he so much dreaded. And being
               ware that a gallant, whom she deemed well
               worthy of her, was enamoured of her, she, using due discretion, came to an
               understanding with him; which being brought to the point that it only remained to
               give
               effect to their words in act, the lady cast about to devise how this might
               be. And witting that, among other bad habits that her husband had, he was too
               fond of his cups, she would not only commend indulgence, but cunningly and not seldom
               incite him thereto; insomuch that, well-nigh as often as she was so minded, she
               led him to drink to excess; and when she saw that he was well drunken, she would put
               him
               to bed; and so not once only but divers times without any manner of risk she forgathered
               with her lover; nay, presuming upon her husband's intoxication, she grew so bold that,
               not
               content with bringing her lover into her house, she would at times go spend a great
               part
               of the night with him at his house, which was not far off.
            </p>
            <p>Now such being the
               enamoured lady's constant practice, it so befell that the dishonoured husband took
               note
               that, while she egged him on to drink, she herself drank never a drop; whereby he
               came to
               suspect the truth, to wit, that the lady was making him drunk, that afterwards she
               might
               take her pleasure while he slept. And being minded to put his surmise to the
               proof, one evening, having drunken nought all day, he mimicked never so drunken a
               sot both
               in
               speech and in carriage. The lady, deeming him to be really as he appeared, and that
               'twas
               needless to ply him with liquor, presently put him to bed.  Which done, she, as she
               at
               times was wont, hied her forth to her lover's house, where she tarried until midnight.
               Tofano no sooner perceived that his wife was gone, than up he got, hied him to
               the door, locked it, and then posted himself at the window to observe her return,
               and let
               her know that he was ware of her misconduct. So there he stood until the lady returned,
               and finding herself locked out, was annoyed beyond measure, and sought to force the
               door
               open. Tofano let her try her strength upon it a while, and then: Madam,
               quoth he, 'tis all to no purpose: thou canst not get in. Go get thee back thither where
               thou hast tarried all this while, and rest assured that thou shalt never recross this
               threshold, until I have done thee such honour as is meet for thee in the presence
               of thy
               kinsfolk and neighbours. Thereupon the lady fell entreating him to be
               pleased to open to her for the love of God, for that she was not come whence he supposed,
               but had only been passing the time
               with one of her gossips, because the nights were long, and she could not spend
               the whole time either in sleep or in solitary watching.
               But her supplications availed her nothing, for the fool was determined
               that all <span class="place">Arezzo</span> should know their shame, whereof as yet none wist aught.  So as
               'twas idle to entreat, the lady assumed a menacing tone, saying: So thou open not to
               me, I will make thee the saddest man alive. Whereto Tofano made answer:
               And what then canst thou do? The lady, her wits sharpened by Love,
               rejoined: Rather than endure the indignity to which thou wouldst unjustly subject me, I
               will cast myself into the well hard by here, and when I am found dead there, all the
               world
               will believe that 'twas thou that didst it in thy cups, and so thou wilt either have
               to
               flee and lose all that thou hast and be outlawed, or forfeit thy head as guilty of
               my
               death, as indeed thou wilt be. But, for all she said, Tofano wavered not a
               jot in his foolish purpose. So at last: Lo, now, quoth the lady, I can no more
               abide thy surly humour: God forgive thee: I leave thee my distaff here, which be careful
               to bestow in a safe place. So saying, away she hied her to the well, and,
               the night being so dark that wayfarers could scarce see one another as they passed,
               she
               took up a huge stone that was by the well, and ejaculating, God forgive me! dropped
               it therein. Tofano, hearing the mighty splash that the stone made as it struck
               the water, never doubted that she had cast herself in: so, bucket and rope in hand,
               he
               flung himself out of the house, and came running to the well to her rescue. The
               lady had meanwhile hidden herself hard by the door, and seeing him make for the well,
               was
               in the house in a trice, and having locked the door, hied her to the window, and greeted
               him with: 'Tis while thou art drinking, not now, when the night is far spent, that thou
               shouldst temper thy wine with water. Thus derided, Tofano came back to the
               door, and finding his ingress barred, began adjuring her to let him
               in. Whereupon, changing the low tone she had hitherto used for one so shrill
               that 'twas well-nigh a shriek, she broke out with: By the Holy Rood, tedious drunken
               sot that thou art, thou gettest no admittance here to-night; thy ways are more than
               I can
               endure: 'tis time I let all the world know what manner of man thou art, and at what
               hour
               of the night thou comest home. Tofano, on his part, now grew angry, and
               began loudly to upbraid her; insomuch that the neighbours, aroused by the noise, 
               got up, men and women alike, and looked out of the windows, and asked what was the
               matter. Whereupon the lady fell a weeping and saying: 'Tis this wicked man,
               who comes home drunk at even, or falls asleep in some tavern, and then returns at
               this
               hour.  Long and to no purpose have I borne with him; but 'tis now past endurance,
               and I
               have done him this indignity of locking him out of
               the house in the hope that perchance it may cause him to mend his
               ways.
            </p>
            <p>Tofano, on his part, told, dolt that he was, just what had happened, and
               was mighty menacing. Whereupon: Now mark, quoth the lady to the
               neighbours, the sort of man he is!  What would you say if I were, as he is, in the
               street, and he were in the house, as I am?  God's faith, I doubt you would believe
               what he
               said. Hereby you may gauge his sense. He tells you that I have done just what, I doubt
               not, he has done himself. He thought to terrify me by throwing I know not what
               into the well, wherein would to God he had thrown himself indeed, and drowned himself,
               whereby the wine of which he has taken more than enough, had
               been watered to some purpose! The neighbours, men and women alike, now with
               one accord gave tongue, censuring Tofano, throwing all the blame upon him, and answering
               what he alleged against the lady with loud recrimination; and in short the bruit,
               passing
               from neighbour to neighbour, reached at last the ears of the lady's kinsfolk;
               who hied them to the spot, and being apprised of the affair from this, that and
               the other of the neighbours, laid hands on Tofano, and beat him till he was black
               and blue
               from head to foot. Which done, they entered his house, stripped it of all that belonged
               to
               the lady, and took her home with them, bidding Tofano look for worse to come.
               Thus hard bested, and ruing the plight in which his jealousy had landed him,
               Tofano, who loved his wife with all his heart, set some friends to work to patch matters
               up, whereby he did in fact induce his lady to forgive him and live with him again;
               albeit
               he was fain to promise her never again to be jealous, and to give her leave to amuse
               herself to her heart's content, provided she used such discretion that he should not
               be
               ware of it. On such wise, like the churl and booby that he was, being
               despoiled, he made terms. Now long live
               Love, and perish war, and all that wage it!

                  in
                  	the city, the magistrates in the courts, nay what God Himself took, when He rested
                  from
                  	all His labours on the seventh day, and which laws human and Divine, mindful alike
                  of the
                  	honour of God and the common well-being, have ordained, appropriating certain days
                  to
                  	work, and others to repose. To which ordinance these jealous
                  	husbands will in no wise conform; on the contrary by then most sedulously secluding
                  their
                  	wives, they make those days which to all other women are gladsome, to them most
                  	grievous and dolorous. And what an affliction it is to the poor creatures, they alone
                  	know, who have proved it; for which reason, to sum up, I say that a wife is
                  	rather to be commended than censured, if she take her revenge upon a husband that
                  is
                  	jealous without cause.

            </div>
            <p>Know then that at <span class="place">Rimini</span> there dwelt a merchant, a man of
               great substance in lands and goods and money, who, having a most beautiful woman to
               wife,
               waxed inordinately jealous of her, and that for no better reason than that, loving
               her
               greatly, and esteeming her exceeding fair, and knowing that she did her utmost endeavour
               to pleasure him, he must needs suppose that every man loved her, and esteemed her
               fair,
               and that she, moreover, was as zealous to stand well with every other man as with
               himself;
               whereby you may see that he was a poor creature, and of little sense. Being
               thus so deeply infected with jealousy, he kept so strict and close watch over her,
               that
               some, maybe, have lain under sentence of death and been less
               rigorously confined by their warders. 'Twas not merely that the lady might not
               go to a wedding, or a festal gathering, or even to church, or indeed set foot out
               of doors
               in any sort; but she dared not so much as shew herself at a window, or cast a glance
               outside the house, no matter for what purpose. Wherefore she led a most woeful life
               of it,
               and found it all the harder to bear because she knew herself to be
               innocent. Accordingly, seeing herself evilly entreated by her husband without
               good cause, she cast about how for her own consolation she might devise means to justify
               his usage of her. And for that, as she might not shew herself at the window,
               there could be no interchange of amorous glances between her and any man that passed
               along
               the street, but she wist that in the next house there was a goodly and debonair gallant,
               she bethought her, that, if there were but a hole in the wall that divided the two
               houses,
               she might watch
               thereat, until she should have sight of the gallant on such wise that she might speak
               to
               him, and give him her love, if he cared to have it, and, if so it might be
               contrived, forgather with him now and again, and after this fashion relieve the burden
               of
               her woeful life, until such time as the evil spirit should depart from her
               husband. So peering about, now here, now there, when her husband was away, she
               found in a very remote part of the house a place, where, by chance, the wall
               had a little chink in it. Peering through which, she made out, though not without
               great
               difficulty, that on the other side was a room, and said to herself: If this were <span class="person">Filippo</span>'s
               room--<span class="person">Filippo</span> was the name of the gallant, her neighbour--I should be already halfway to
               my goal. So cautiously, through her maid, who was grieved to see her thus
               languish, she made quest, and discovered that it was indeed the gallant's room, where
               he
               slept quite alone. Wherefore she now betook her frequently to the aperture, and whenever
               she was ware that the gallant was in the room, she would let fall a pebble or the
               like
               trifle; whereby at length she brought the gallant to the other side of the aperture
               to see
               what the matter was. Whereupon she
               softly called him, and he knowing her voice, answered; and so, having now the opportunity
               she had sought, she in few words opened to him all her mind. The gallant, being
               overjoyed, wrought at the aperture on such wise that albeit none might be ware thereof,
               he
               enlarged it; and there many a time they held converse together, and touched hands,
               though
               further they might not go by reason of the assiduous watch that the jealous husband
               kept.
            </p>
            <p>Now towards Christmas the lady told her husband that, if he
               approved, she would fain go on Christmas morning to church, and confess and communicate,
               like other Christians. And what sins, quoth he, hast thou committed, that
               wouldst be shriven? How? returned the lady; dost thou take me for
               a saint? For all thou keepest me so close, thou must know very well that I am like
               all
               other mortals. However, I am not minded to confess to thee, for that thou art no
               priest. Her husband, whose suspicions were excited by what she had said,
               cast about how he might discover these sins of hers, and having bethought him of what
               seemed an apt expedient, made answer that she had his consent, but he would not have
               her
               go to any church but their own chapel, where she might hie her betimes in the morning,
               and
               confess either to their own chaplain or some other priest that the chaplain might
               assign
               her, but to none other, and presently return to the house. The lady thought she half
               understood him, but she answered only that she would do as he required.
               Christmas morning came, and with the dawn the lady rose, dressed herself, and
               hied her to the church appointed by her husband, who also rose, and hied him to the
               same
               church, where he arrived before her; and having already concerted matters with
               the priest that was in charge, he forthwith put on one of the priest's robes with
               a great
               hood, overshadowing the face, such as we see priests wear, and which he pulled somewhat
               forward; and so disguised he seated himself in the choir.
            </p>
            <p>On entering the church
               the lady asked for the priest, who came, and learning that she was minded to confess,
               said
               that he could not
               hear her himself, but would send her one of his brethren; so away he hied him and
               sent
               her, in an evil hour for him, her husband.  For though he wore an air of great
               solemnity, and 'twas not yet broad day, and he had pulled the hood well over his eyes,
               yet
               all did not avail, but that his lady forthwith recognized him, and said to herself:
               God be
               praised! why, the jealous rogue is turned priest: but leave it me to give him that
               whereof
               he is in quest. So she feigned not to know him, and seated herself at his
               feet. (I should tell you that he had put some pebbles in his mouth, that his speech,
               being
               impeded, might not betray him to his wife, and in all other respects he deemed himself
               so
               thoroughly disguised that there was
               nought whereby she might recognize him.) Now, to come to the confession, the
               lady, after informing him that she was married, told him among other matters that
               she was
               enamoured of a priest, who came every night to lie with her. Which to hear was
               to her husband as if he were stricken through the heart with a knife; and had it not
               been
               that he was bent on knowing more, he would have forthwith given over the confession,
               and
               taken himself off. However he kept his place, and: How? said he to the lady,
               does not your husband lie with you? The lady replied in the affirmative.
               How, then, quoth the husband, can the priest also lie with you?
               Sir, replied she, what art the priest employs I know not; but door
               there is none, however well locked, in the house,
               that comes not open at his touch; and he tells me that, being come to the door of
               my room,
               before he opens it, he says certain words, whereby my husband forthwith falls asleep;
               whereupon he opens the door, and enters the room, and lies with me; and so 'tis always,
               without fail. Then 'tis very wrong, Madam, and you must give it up
               altogether, said the husband. That, Sir, returned the lady, I
               doubt I can never do; for I love him too much. In that case, quoth
               the husband, I cannot give you absolution. The pity of
               it! ejaculated the lady; I came not hither to tell you falsehoods: if I could give
               it up, I would. Madam, replied the husband, indeed I am sorry for
               you; for I see that you are in a fair way to lose your soul. However, this I will
               do for
               you; I will make special supplication to God on your behalf; and perchance you may
               be
               profited thereby. And from time to time I will send you one of my young clerks; and
               you
               will tell him whether my prayers have been of any help to you, or no, and if they
               have
               been so, I shall know what to do next. Nay, Sir, quoth the lady,
               do not so; send no man to me at home; for, should my husband come to know it, he is
               so
               jealous that nothing in the world would ever disabuse him of the idea that he came
               but for
               an evil
               purpose, and so I should have no peace with him all the year long.
               Madam, returned the husband, have no fear; rest assured that I will
               so order matters that you shall never hear a word about it from him. If
               you can make sure of that, quoth the lady, I have no more to say. And so, her
               confession ended, and her penance enjoined, she rose, and went to mass, while
               the luckless husband, fuming and fretting, hasted to divest himself of his priest's
               trappings, and then went home bent upon devising some means to bring the priest and
               his
               wife together, and take his revenge upon them both.
            </p>
            <p>When the lady came home
               from church she read in her husband's face that she had spoiled his Christmas for
               him,
               albeit he dissembled to the uttermost, lest she should discover what he had done,
               and
               supposed himself to have learned. His mind was made up to keep watch for the
               priest that very night by his own front door. So to the lady he said: I have to go out
               to-night to sup and sleep; so thou wilt take care that the front door, and the mid-stair
               door, and the bedroom door are well locked; and for the rest thou mayst go to bed,
               at
               thine own time. Well and good, replied the lady: 
               and as
               soon as she was able, off she hied her to the aperture, and gave the wonted signal,
               which
               <span class="person">Filippo</span> no sooner heard, than he was at the spot. The lady then told him what she had done
               in the morning, and what her husband had said to her after breakfast, adding: Sure I am
               that he will not stir out of the house, but will keep watch beside the door; wherefore
               contrive to come in to-night by the roof, that we may be together.
               Madam, replied the gallant, nothing loath, trust me for that.
            </p>
            <p>Night came, the husband armed, and noiselessly hid himself in a room on the ground
               floor: the lady locked all the doors, being especially careful to secure the mid-stair
               door, to bar her husband's ascent; and in due time the gallant, having found his way
               cautiously enough over the roof, they got them to bed, and there had solace of one
               another
               and a good time; and at daybreak the gallant hied him back to his
               house. Meanwhile the husband, rueful and supperless, half dead with cold, kept
               his armed watch beside his door, momently expecting the priest, for the best part
               of the
               night; but towards daybreak, his powers failing him, he lay down and slept in the
               ground-floor room. 'Twas hard upon tierce when he awoke, and the front door was
               then open; so, making as if he had just come in, he went upstairs and breakfasted.
               Not
               long afterwards he sent to his wife a young fellow, disguised as the priest's underling,
               who asked her if he of whom she wist had been with her again. The lady, who
               quite understood what that meant, made answer that he had not come that night, and
               that,
               if he continued to neglect her so, 'twas possible he might be forgotten, though she
               had no
               mind to forget him.
            </p>
            <p>Now, to make a long story short, the husband passed many a
               night in the same way, hoping to catch the priest as he came in, the lady and her
               gallant
               meanwhile having a good time. But at last the husband, being able to stand it no longer,
               sternly demanded of his wife what she had said to the priest the morning when she
               was
               confessed. The lady answered that she was not minded to tell him, for that 'twas not
               seemly or proper so to do. Whereupon: Sinful woman, quoth the husband,
               in thy despite I know what thou saidst to him, and know I must and will who this priest
               is, of whom thou art enamoured, and who by dint of his incantations lies with thee
               a
               nights, or I will sluice thy veins for thee. 'Tis not true, replied
               the lady, that I am enamoured of a priest. How? quoth the
               husband, saidst thou not as much to the priest that confessed thee?
               Thou canst not have had it from
               him, rejoined the lady. Wast thou then present thyself? For sure I never told him
               so. Then tell me, quoth the husband, who this priest is; and lose
               no time about it. Whereat the lady began to smile, and: I find it not a
               little diverting, quoth she, that a wise man should suffer himself to be led by a
               simple woman as a ram is led by the horns to the shambles; albeit no wise man
               art thou: not since that fatal hour when thou gavest harbourage in thy breast, thou
               wist
               not why, to the evil spirit of jealousy; and the more foolish and insensate thou art,
               the
               less glory have I.  Deemest thou, my husband, that I am as blind of the bodily
               eye as thou art of the mind's eye? Nay, but for sure I am not so.  I knew at a glance
               the
               priest that confessed me, and that 'twas even thyself. But I was minded to give thee
               that
               of which thou wast in quest, and I gave it thee. Howbeit, if thou hadst been
               the wise man thou takest thyself to be, thou wouldst not have chosen such a way as
               that to
               worm out thy good lady's secrets, nor wouldst thou have fallen a prey to a baseless
               suspicion, but wouldst have understood that what she confessed was true, and she all
               the
               while guiltless. I told thee that I loved a priest; and wast not thou, whom I
               love, though ill enough dost thou deserve it, turned priest? I told thee that there
               was no
               door in my house but would open when he was minded to lie with me: and when thou wouldst
               fain have access to me, what door was ever closed against thee?  I told thee
               that the priest lay nightly with me: and what night was there that thou didst not
               lie with
               me? Thou sentest thy young clerk to me: and thou knowest that, as often as thou hadst
               not
               been with me, I sent word that the priest had not been with me. Who but thou,
               that hast suffered jealousy to blind thee, would have been so witless as not to read
               such
               a riddle? But thou must needs mount guard at night beside the door, and think to make
               me
               believe that thou hadst gone out to sup and sleep.  Consider thy ways, and
               court not the mockery of those that know them as I do, but turn a man again as thou
               wast
               wont to be: and let there be no more of this strict restraint in which thou keepest
               me;
               for I swear to thee by God that, if I were minded to set horns on thy brow, I should
               not
               fail so to take my pastime that thou wouldst never find it out, though thou hadst
               a
               hundred eyes, as thou hast but two.
            </p>
            <p>Thus admonished, the jealous caitiff, who
               had flattered himself that he had very cunningly discovered his wife's secret, was
               ashamed, and made no answer save to commend his wife's wit and honour; and thus, having
               cause for jealousy, he discarded it, as he had erstwhile been jealous without
               cause.  And so the adroit lady had, as it were, a charter of indulgence, and needed
               no
               more to contrive for her lover to come to her over the roof like a cat, but admitted
               him

            <p>In our city, rich in all manner of good things, there dwelt a
               young gentlewoman, fair exceedingly, and wedded to a most worthy and excellent
               gentleman. And as it not seldom happens that one cannot keep ever to the same
               diet, but would fain at times vary it, so this lady, finding her husband not altogether
               to
               her mind, became enamoured of a gallant, Leonetto by name, who, though of no high
               rank,
               was not a little debonair and courteous, and he in like manner
               fell in love with her; and (as you know that 'tis seldom that what is
               mutually desired fails to come about) 'twas not long before they had
               fruition of their love. Now the lady being, as I said, fair and winsome,
               it so befell that a gentleman, Messer <span class="person">Lambertuccio</span> by name, grew mightily enamoured of
               her, but so tiresome and odious did she find him, that for the world she could
               not bring herself to love him.  So, growing tired of fruitlessly soliciting her favour
               by
               ambassage, Messer <span class="person">Lambertuccio</span>, who was a powerful signior, sent her at last another sort
               of message in which he threatened to defame her if she complied not with his
               wishes. Wherefore the lady, knowing her man, was terrified, and disposed herself to
               pleasure him.
            </p>
            <p>Now it so chanced that Madonna <span class="person">Isabella</span>, for such was the lady's
               name, being gone, as is our Florentine custom in the summer, to spend some time on
               a very
               goodly estate that she had in the contado, one morning finding herself alone, for
               her
               husband had ridden off to tarry some days elsewhere, she sent for Leonetto to come
               and
               keep her company; and Leonetto came forthwith in high glee. But while they were
               together, Messer <span class="person">Lambertuccio</span>, who, having got wind that the husband was away, had mounted
               his horse and ridden thither quite alone, knocked at the door. Whereupon the
               lady's maid hied her forthwith to her mistress, who was alone with Leonetto, and called
               her, saying: Madam, Messer <span class="person">Lambertuccio</span> is here below, quite alone.
               Whereat the lady was vexed beyond measure; and being also not a little
               dismayed, she said to Leonetto: Prithee, let it not irk thee to withdraw behind the
               curtain, and there keep close until Messer <span class="person">Lambertuccio</span> be gone. Leonetto,
               who stood in no less fear of Messer <span class="person">Lambertuccio</span> than did the lady, got into his
               hiding-place; and the lady bade the maid go open to Messer <span class="person">Lambertuccio</span>: she did so; and
               having dismounted and fastened his palfrey to a pin, he ascended the stairs; at
               the head of which the lady received him with a smile and as gladsomea greeting as
               she
               could find words for, and asked him on what errand he was come.  The gentleman
               embraced and kissed her, saying: My soul, I am informed that your husband is not here,
               and therefore I am come to stay a while with you. Which said, they went into the room,
               and locked them in, and Messer <span class="person">Lambertuccio</span> fell a toying with her.
            </p>
            <p>Now, while thus
               he sped the time with her, it befell that the lady's husband, albeit she nowise expected
               him, came home, and, as he drew nigh the palace, was observed by the maid, who forthwith
               ran to the lady's chamber, and said: Madam, the master will be here anon; I doubt he is
               already in the courtyard. Whereupon, for that she had two men in the house,
               and the knight's palfrey, that was in the courtyard, made it impossible to hide him,
               the
               lady gave herself up for dead. Nevertheless she made up her mind on the spur
               of the moment, and springing out of bed: Sir, quoth she to Messer <span class="person">Lambertuccio</span>,
               if you have any regard for me, and would save my life, you will do as I bid you:
               that is to say, you will draw your blade, and put on a fell and wrathful
               countenance, and hie you downstairs, saying: 'By God, he shall not escape me elsewhere.'
               And if my husband would stop you, or ask you aught, say nought but what I have told
               you,
               and get you on horseback and tarry with him on no account. To hear is to
               obey, quoth Messer <span class="person">Lambertuccio</span>, who, with the flush of his recent exertion and the
               rage that he felt at the husband's return still on his face, and drawn sword in hand,
               did
               as she bade him. The lady's husband, being now dismounted in the courtyard, and not
               a
               little surprised to see the palfrey there, was about to go up the stairs, when he
               saw
               Messer <span class="person">Lambertuccio</span> coming down them, and marvelling both at his words and at
               his mien: What means this, Sir? quoth he. But Messer <span class="person">Lambertuccio</span>
               clapped foot in stirrup, and mounted, saying nought but: Zounds, but I will meet him
               elsewhere; and so he rode off.
            </p>
            <p>The gentleman then ascended the stairs, at the
               head of which he found his lady distraught with terror, to whom he said: What manner of
               thing is this? After whom goes Messer <span class="person">Lambertuccio</span>, so wrathful and menacing?
               Whereto the lady, drawing nigher the room, that Leonetto might hear her, made
               answer: Never, Sir, had I such a fright as this. There came running in here a young
               man, who to me is quite a stranger, and at his heels Messer <span class="person">Lambertuccio</span> with a drawn
               sword in his hand; and as it happened the young man found the door of this room open,
               and
               trembling in every limb, cried out: 'Madam, your succour, for God's sake, that I die
               not
               in your arms.'  So up I got, and would have asked him who he was, and how
               bested, when up came Messer <span class="person">Lambertuccio</span>, exclaiming: 'Where art thou, traitor?' I planted
               myself in the doorway, and kept him from entering, and seeing that I was not minded
               to
               give him admittance, he was courteous enough, after not a little parley, to take himself
               off, as you saw. Whereupon:
               Wife, quoth the husband, thou didst very right. Great indeed had been the
               scandal, had some one been slain here, and 'twas a gross affront on Messer <span class="person">Lambertuccio</span>'s
               part to pursue a fugitive within the house. He then asked where the young man
               was. Whereto the lady answered: Nay, where he may be hiding,
               Sir, I wot not. So: Where art thou? quoth the knight. Fear not to
               shew thyself. Then forth of his hiding-place, all of a tremble, for in
               truth he had been thoroughly terrified, crept Leonetto, who had heard all that had
               passed.
               To whom: What hast thou to do with Messer <span class="person">Lambertuccio</span>? quoth the
               knight. Nothing in the world, replied the young man: wherefore, I
               doubt he must either be out of his mind, or have mistaken me for another; for no sooner
               had he sight of me in the street hard by the palace, than he laid his hand on his
               sword,
               and exclaimed: 'Traitor, thou art a dead man.'  Whereupon I sought not to know why,but
               fled with all speed, and got me here, and so, thanks to God and this gentlewoman,
               I
               escaped his hands. Now away with thy fears, quoth the knight; I
               will see thee home safe and sound; and then 'twill be for thee to
               determine how thou shalt deal with him. And so, when they had supped, he
               set him on horseback, and escorted him to <span class="place">Florence</span>, and left him not until he was safe in
               his own house. And the very same evening, following the lady's instructions, Leonetto
               spoke privily with Messer <span class="person">Lambertuccio</span>, and so composed the affair with him, that, though
               it occasioned not a little talk, the knight never wist how he had been tricked by
               his
               wife.

            <p>You are to know, then,
               that there dwelt aforetime at <span class="place">Paris</span> a Florentine gentleman, who, being by reason of
               poverty turned merchant, had prospered so well in his affairs that he was become very
               wealthy; and having by his lady an only son, Lodovico by name, whose nobility
               disrelished trade, he would not put him in any shop;
               but that he might be with other gentlemen, he caused him to enter the service of the
               King
               of <span class="place">France</span>, whereby he acquired very fine manners and other
               accomplishments. Being in this service, Lodovico was one day with some other
               young gallants that talked of the fair ladies of <span class="place">France</span>, and <span class="place">England</span>, and other parts of
               the world, when they were joined by certain knights that were returned from the Holy
               Sepulchre; and hearing their discourse, one of the knights fell a saying, that of
               a surety
               in the whole world, so far as he had explored it, there was not any lady, of all that
               he
               had ever seen, that might compare for beauty with Madonna Beatrice, the wife of Egano
               de'
               Galluzzi, of <span class="place">Bologna</span>: wherein all his companions, who
               in common with him had seen the lady at <span class="place">Bologna</span>, concurred.
               Which report Lodovico, who was as yet fancy-free, no sooner heard, than he
               burned with such a yearning to see the lady that he was able to think of nought else:
               insomuch that he made up his mind to betake him to <span class="place">Bologna</span> to see her, and if she pleased
               him, to remain there; to which end he gave his father to understand that he would
               fain
               visit the <span class="place">Holy Sepulchre</span>, whereto his father after no little demur consented.
            </p>
            <p>So to
               <span class="place">Bologna</span> Anichino--for so he now called himself--came; and, as Fortune would have it, the
               very next day, he saw the lady at a festal gathering, and deemed her vastly more beautiful
               than he had expected: wherefore he waxed most ardently enamoured of her, and resolved
               never to quit <span class="place">Bologna</span>, until he had gained her love. So, casting about how he
               should proceed, he could devise no other way but to enter her husband's service, which
               was
               the more easy that he kept not a few retainers: on this wise Lodovico surmised that,
               peradventure, he might compass his end. He therefore sold his horses and meetly
               bestowed his servants, bidding them make as if they
               knew him not; and being pretty familiar with his host, he told him that he was minded
               to
               take service with some worthy lord, it any such he might find. Thou wouldst make,
               quoth the host, the very sort of retainer to suit a gentleman of this city, Egano by
               name, who keeps not a few of them, and will have all of them presentable like thee:
               I will
               mention the matter to him. And so he accordingly did, and before he took
               leave of Egano had placed Anichino with him, to Egano's complete satisfact ion.
            </p>
            <p>Being thus resident with Egano, and having abundant opportunities of seeing the fair
               lady, Anichino set himself to serve Egano with no little zeal; wherein he succeeded
               so
               well, that Egano was
               more than satisfied, insomuch that by and by there was nought he could do without
               his
               advice, and he entrusted to him the guidance not only of himself, but of all his
               affairs. Now it so befell that one day when Egano was gone a hawking, having
               left Anichino at home, Madonna Beatrice, who as yet wist not of his love, albeit she
               had
               from time to time taken note of him and his manners, and had not a little approved
               and
               commended them, sat herself down with him to a game of chess, which, to please her,
               Anichino most dexterously contrived to lose, to the lady's prodigious delight.
               After a while, the lady's women, one and all, gave over watching
               their play, and left them to it; whereupon Anichino heaved a mighty sigh. The
               lady, looking hard at him, said: What ails thee, Anichino? Is it, then, such a
               mortification to thee to be conquered by me? Nay, Madam, replied
               Anichino, my sigh was prompted by a much graver matter. Then, if thou
               hast any regard for me, quoth the lady, tell me what it is. Hearing
               himself thus adjured by any regard he had for her whom he loved more than aught
               else, Anichino heaved a yet mightier sigh, which caused the lady to renew her
               request that he would be pleased to tell her the occasion of his sighs.
               Whereupon: Madam, said Anichino, I greatly fear me, that, were I to tell it you,
               'twould but vex you; and, moreover, I doubt you might repeat it to some one else.
               Rest assured, returned the lady, that I shall neither be annoyed,
               nor, without thy leave, ever repeat to any other soul aught that thou mayst say.
               Then, said Anichino, having this pledge from you, I will tell it
               you. And, while the tears all but stood in his eyes, he told her, who he was, the
               report he had heard of her, and where and how he had become enamoured of her, and
               with
               what intent he had taken service with her husband: after which, he humbly besought
               her,
               that, if it might be, she would have pity on him, and gratify this his secret and
               ardent
               desire; and that, if she were not minded so to do, she would suffer him to retain
               his
               place there, and love her. Ah! <span class="place">Bologna</span>! how sweetly mixed are the elements in
               thy women! How commendable in such a case are they all! No delight have they in sighs
               and
               tears, but are ever inclinable to prayers, and ready to yield to the solicitations
               of
               Love. Had I but words apt to praise them as they deserve, my eloquence were
               inexhaustible.
            </p>
            <p>The gentlewoman's gaze was fixed on Anichino as he spoke; she made
               no doubt that all he said was true, and yielding to his appeal, she entertained his
               love
               within her heart in such measure that she too began to sigh, and after a sigh or two
               made
               answer: Sweet my Anichino, be of good cheer; neither presents nor
               promises, nor any courting by gentleman, or lord, or whoso else (for I have been and
               am
               still courted by not a few) was ever able to sway my soul to love any of them: but
               thou,
               by the few words that thou hast said, hast so wrought with me that, brief though the
               time
               has been, I am already in far greater measure thine than mine. My love 
               I deem thee to have won right worthily; and so I give it thee, and vow to give
               thee joyance thereof before the coming night be past.  To which end thou wilt
               come to my room about midnight; I will leave the door open; thou knowest the side
               of the
               bed on which I sleep; thou wilt come there; should I be asleep, thou hast but to touch
               me,
               and I shall awake, and give thee solace of thy long-pent desire. In earnest whereof
               I will
               even give thee a kiss. So saying, she threw her arms about his neck, and lovingly
               kissed him, as Anichino her.
            </p>
            <p>Their colloquy thus ended, Anichino betook him
               elsewhere about some matters which he had to attend to, looking forward to midnight
               with
               boundless exultation. Egano came in from his hawking; and after supper, being
               weary, went straight to bed, whither the lady soon followed him, leaving, as she had
               promised, the door of the
               chamber open. Thither accordingly, at the appointed hour, came Anichino, and
               having softly entered the chamber, and closed the door behind him, stole up to where
               the
               lady lay, and laying his hand upon her breast, found that she was awake. Now,
               as soon as she wist that Anichino was come, she took his hand in both her own; and
               keeping
               fast hold of him, she turned about in the bed, until she awoke Egano;
               whereupon: Husband, quoth she, I would not say aught of this to thee,
               yestereve, because I judged thou wast weary; but tell me, upon thy hope of salvation,
               Egano, whom deemest thou thy best and most loyal retainer, and the most attached to
               thee, of all that thou hast in the house? What a question is this,
               wife? returned Egano. Dost not know him? Retainer I have none, nor ever had, so
               trusted, or loved, as Anichino. But wherefore put such a question?
            </p>
            <p>Now, when
               Anichino wist that Egano was awake, and heard them talk of himself, he more than once
               tried to withdraw his hand,
               being mightily afraid lest the lady meant to play him false; but she held it so tightly
               that he might not get free, while thus she made answer to Egano: I will tell
               thee what he is. I thought that he was all thou sayst, and that none was so loyal
               to thee
               as he, but he has undeceived me, for that yesterday, when thou wast out a hawking,
               he,
               being here, chose his time, and had the shamelessness to crave of me compliance with
               his
               wanton desires: and I, that I might not need other evidence than that of thine
               own senses to prove his guilt to thee, I made answer, that I was well content,
               and that to-night, after midnight, I would get me into the garden, and await him there
               at
               the foot of the pine. Now go thither I shall certainly not; but, if thou
               wouldst prove the loyalty of thy retainer, thou canst readily do so, if thou but slip
               on
               one of my loose robes, and cover thy face with a veil, and go down and attend his
               coming,
               for come, I doubt not, he will. Whereto Egano: Meet indeed it is,
               quoth he, that I should go see; and straightway up he got, and, as best he might in
               the dark, he put on one of the lady's loose robes and veiled his face, and then hied
               him
               to the garden, and sate down at the foot of the pine to await Anichino. The
               lady no sooner wist that he was out of the room, than she rose, and locked the
               door. Anichino, who
               had never been so terrified in all his life, and had struggled with all
               his might to disengage his hand from the lady's clasp, and had inwardly cursed her
               and his
               love, and himself for trusting her, a hundred thousand times, was overjoyed beyond
               measure
               at this last turn that she had given the affair. And so, the lady having got her to
               bed
               again, and he, at her bidding, having stripped and laid him down beside her, they
               had
               solace and joyance of one another for a good while. Then, the lady, deeming it
               unmeet for Anichino to tarry longer with her, caused him to get up and resume his
               clothes,
               saying to him: Sweet my mouth, thou wilt take a stout cudgel,
               and get thee to the garden, and making as if I were there, and thy suit to me had
               been but
               to try me, thou wilt give Egano a sound rating with thy tongue and a sound belabouring
               with thy cudgel, the sequel whereof will be wondrously gladsome and delightful.
               Whereupon Anichino hied him off to the garden, armed with a staff of wild
               willow; and as he drew nigh the pine, Egano saw him, and rose and came forward to
               meet him
               as if he would receive him with the heartiest of cheer. But: Ah! wicked woman!
               quoth Anichino; so thou art come! Thou didst verily believe, then, that I was, that I
               am, minded thus to wrong my lord? Foul fall thee a
               thousand times! And therewith he raised his cudgel, and began to lay about
               him. Egano, however, had heard and seen enough, and without a word took to
               flight, while Anichino pursued him, crying out: Away with thee!  God send thee a bad
               year, lewd woman that thou art; nor doubt that Egano shall hear of this to-morrow.
               Egano, having received sundry round knocks, got him back to his 
               chamber with what speed he might; and being asked by the lady, whether Anichino
               had come into the garden: Would to God he had not! quoth he, for
               that, taking me for thee, he has beaten me black and blue with his cudgel, and rated
               me
               like the vilest woman that ever was: passing strange, indeed, it had seemed to me
               that he
               should have said those words to thee with intent to dishonour me;
               and now 'tis plain that 'twas but that, seeing thee so blithe and
               frolicsome, he was minded to prove thee. Whereto: God be
               praised, returned the lady, that he proved me by words, as thee by
               acts: and I doubt not he may say that I bear his words with more patience than thou
               his
               acts. But since he is so loyal to thee, we must make much of him and do him honour.
               Ay, indeed, quoth Egano, thou sayst sooth.
            </p>
            <p>Thus was Egano
               fortified in the belief that never had any gentleman wife so true, or retainer so
               loyal,
               as he; and many a hearty
               laugh had he with Anichino and his lady over this affair, which to them was the occasion
               that, with far less let than might else have been, they were able to have solace and
               joyance of one another, so long as it pleased Anichino to tarry at <span class="place">Bologna</span>.

            <p>A husband
               grows jealous of his wife, and discovers that she has warning of her lover's approach
               by a
               piece of
               pack-thread, which she ties to her great toe a nights.  While he is pursuing her lover,
               she puts another woman in bed in her place. The husband, finding her there, beats
               her, and
               cuts off her hair. He then
               goes and calls his wife's brothers, who, holding his accusation to be false, give

            </div>
            <p>You are to know,
               then, that there dwelt aforetime in our
               city a most wealthy merchant, Arriguccio Berlinghieri by name, who foolishly, as we
               wot by
               daily experience is the way of merchants, thinking to compass gentility by matrimony,
               took
               to wife a young gentlewoman, by no means suited to him, whose name was Monna
               Sismonda. Now Monna Sismonda, seeing that her husband was much abroad, and gave
               her little of his company, became enamoured of a young gallant, Ruberto by
               name, who had long courted her: and she being grown pretty familiar with him,
               and using, perchance, too little discretion, for she affected him extremely, it so
               befell
               that Arriguccio, whether it was that he detected somewhat, or howsoever, waxed of
               all men
               the most jealous, and gave up going abroad, and changed his way of life altogether,
               and
               made it his sole care to watch over his wife, insomuch that he never allowed himself
               a
               wink of sleep until he had seen her to bed: which occasioned the lady the most grievous
               dumps, because 'twas on no wise possible for her to be with her Ruberto.  So,
               casting about in many ways how she might contrive to meet him, and
               being thereto not a little plied by Ruberto himself, she bethought her at last of
               the
               following expedient: to wit, her room fronting the street, and Arriguccio, as she
               had
               often observed, being very hard put to it to get him to sleep, but thereafter sleeping
               very soundly, she resolved to arrange with Ruberto that he should come to the front
               door
               about midnight, whereupon she would get her down, and open the door, and stay some
               time
               with him while her husband was in his deep sleep. And that she might have
               tidings of his arrival, yet so as that none else might wot aught thereof, she adopted
               the
               device of lowering a pack-thread from the bedroom window on such wise that, while
               with one
               end it should all but touch the ground, it should traverse the floor of the room,
               until it
               reached the bed, and then be brought under the clothes, so that, when she was abed,
               she
               might attach it to her great toe. Having so done, she sent word to Ruberto,
               that when he came, he must be sure to jerk the pack-thread, and, if her husband were
               asleep, she would loose it, and go open to him; but, if he were awake, she would hold
               it
               taut and draw it to herself, to let him know that he must not expect
               her. Ruberto fell in with the idea, came there many
               times, and now forgathered with her and again did not. But at last, they still
               using this cunning practice, it so befell that one night, while the lady slept,
               Arriguccio, letting his foot stray more than he was wont about the bed, came upon
               the
               pack-thread, and laying his hand upon it, found that it was attached to his lady's
               great
               toe, and said to himself: This must be some trick: and afterwards discovering
               that the thread passed out of the window, was confirmed in his surmise. Wherefore,
               he
               softly severed it from the lady's toe, and affixed it to his own; and waited,
               all attention, to learn the result of his experiment. Nor had he long to wait
               before Ruberto came, and Arriguccio felt him jerk the thread according to his wont:
               and as
               Arriguccio had not known how to attach the thread securely, and Ruberto jerked it
               with
               some force, it gave way, whereby he understood that he was to wait, and did
               so. Arriguccio straightway arose, caught up his arms, and hasted to the door to
               see who might be there, intent to do him a mischief. Now Arriguccio, for all he was
               a
               merchant, was a man of spirit, and of thews and sinews; and being
               come to the door, he opened it by no means gingerly, as the lady was wont; whereby
               Ruberto, who was in waiting, surmised the truth, to wit, that 'twas Arriguccio by
               whom the
               door was opened.  Wherefore he forthwith took to flight, followed by
               Arriguccio. But at length, when he had run a long way, as Arriguccio gave not
               up the pursuit, he being also armed, drew his sword, and faced about; and so they
               fell to,
               Arriguccio attacking, and Ruberto defending himself.
            </p>
            <p>Now when Arriguccio undid the
               bedroom door, the lady awoke, and finding the pack-thread cut loose from her toe,
               saw at a
               glance that her trick was discovered; and hearing Arriguccio running after Ruberto,
               she
               forthwith got up, foreboding what the result was like to be, and called her maid,
               who was
               entirely in her confidence:
               whom she so plied with her obsecrations that at last she got her into bed in her room,
               beseeching her not to say who she was, but to bear patiently all the blows that Arriguccio
               might give her; and she would so reward her that she should have no reason to complain.
               Then, extinguishing the light that was in the room, forth she hied her, and
               having found a convenient hiding-place in the house, awaited the turn of
               events. Now Arriguccio and Ruberto being hotly engaged in the street, the
               neighbours, roused by the din of the combat, got up and launched their curses upon
               them. Wherefore
               Arriguccio, fearing lest he should be recognized, drew off before he had so much as
               discovered who the young gallant was, or done him any scathe, and in a fell and wrathful
               mood betook him home.  Stumbling into the bedroom, he cried out angrily: Where art
               thou, lewd woman? Thou hast put out the light, that I may not be able to find thee;
               but
               thou hast miscalculated. And going to the bedside, he laid hold of the
               maid, taking her to be his wife, and fell a pummelling and kicking her with
               all the strength he had in his hands and feet, insomuch that he pounded her face well-nigh
               to pulp, rating her the while like the vilest woman that ever was; and last of all
               he cut
               off her hair. The maid wept bitterly, as indeed she well might; and though from
               time to time she ejaculated an Alas! Mercy, for God's sake! or Spare me, spare
               me; yet her voice was so broken by her sobs, and Arriguccio's hearing so dulled by his
               wrath, that he was not able to discern that 'twas not
               his wife's voice but that of another woman. So, having soundly thrashed her,
               and cut off her hair, as we said: Wicked woman, quoth he, I touch thee no more;
               but I go to find thy brothers, and shall do them to wit of thy good works; and then
               they
               may come here, and deal with thee as they may deem their honour demands, and take
               thee
               hence, for be sure thou shalt no more abide in this house. With this he was gone,
               locking the door of the room behind him, and quitted the house alone.
            </p>
            <p>Now no sooner
               did Monna Sismonda, who had heard all that passed, perceive that her husband was gone,
               than she opened the door of the bedroom, rekindled the light, and finding her maid
               all
               bruises and tears, did what she could to comfort her, and carried her back to her
               own
               room, where, causing her to be privily waited on and tended, she helped her so liberally
               from Arriguccio's own store, that she confessed herself content. The maid thus
               bestowed in her room, the lady presently hied her back to her own, which she set all
               in
               neat and trim order, remaking the bed, so that it might
               appear as if it had not been slept in, relighting the lamp, and dressing
               and tiring herself, until she looked as if she had not been abed that
               night; then, taking with her a lighted lamp and some work, she sat her down at the
               head of
               the stairs, and began sewing, while she waited to see how the affair would end.
            </p>
            <p>Arriguccio meanwhile had hied him with all speed straight from the house to that of
               his
               wife's brothers, where by dint of much knocking he made himself heard, and was
               admitted. The lady's
               three brothers, and her mother, being informed that 'twas Arriguccio, got up, and
               having
               set lights a burning, came to him and asked him on what errand he was come there at
               that
               hour, and alone. Whereupon Arriguccio, beginning with the discovery of the
               pack-thread attached to his lady's great toe, gave them the whole narrative of
               his discoveries and doings down to the very end; and to clinch the whole matter, he
               put in
               their hands the locks which he had cut, as he believed, from his wife's head, adding
               that
               'twas now for them to come for her and deal with her on such wise as they might deem
               their
               honour required, seeing that he would nevermore have her in his house. Firmly
               believing what he told them, the lady's brothers were very wroth with her, and having
               provided themselves with lighted torches, set out with Arriguccio, and hied them to
               his
               house with intent to scorn her, while their mother followed, weeping and
               beseeching now one, now another, not to credit these matters so hastily, until they
               had
               seen or heard somewhat more thereof; for that the husband might have some other reason
               to
               be wroth with her, and having ill-treated her, might have trumped up this charge by
               way of
               exculpation, adding that, if true, 'twas passing strange, for well she knew her daughter,
               whom she had brought up from her tenderest years, and much more to the like
               effect.
            </p>
            <p>However, being come to Arriguccio's house, they entered, and were mounting
               the stairs, when Monna Sismonda, hearing them, called out: Who is there?
               Whereto one of the brothers responded: Lewd woman, thou shalt soon have
               cause enough to know who it is. Now Lord love us! quoth Monna
               Sismonda, what would he be at? Then, rising, she greeted them with: Welcome, my
               brothers; but what seek ye abroad at this hour, all three of you? They had
               seen her sitting and sewing with never a sign of a blow on her face, whereas Arriguccio
               had averred that he had pummelled her all over: wherefore their first impression was
               one
               of wonder, and refraining the vehemence of their wrath, they asked her what might
               be the
               truth of the matter which Arriguccio
               laid to her charge, and threatened her with direful consequences, if she should conceal
               aught. Whereto the lady: What you would have me tell you, quoth she,
               or what Arriguccio may have laid to my charge, that know not I. Arriguccio could
               but gaze upon her, as one that had taken leave of his wits, calling to mind how he
               had
               pummelled her about the face times without number, and scratched it for her, and
               mishandled her in all manner of ways, and there he now saw her with no trace of aught
               of
               it all upon her. However, to make a long story short, the lady's brothers told
               her what Arriguccio had told them touching the pack-thread and the beating and
               all the rest of it. Whereupon the lady turned to him with: Alas, my husband,
               what is this that I hear? Why givest thou me, to thy own great shame, the reputation
               of a
               lewd woman, when such I am not, and thyself the reputation of a wicked and cruel man,
               which thou art not? Wast thou ever to-night, I say not in my company, but so much
               as in
               the house until now? Or when didst thou beat me?  For my part I mind me not of it.
               Arriguccio began: How sayst thou, lewd woman? Did we not go to bed together?
               Did I not come back, after chasing thy lover? Did I not give thee bruises not a few,
               and
               cut thy hair for thee? But the lady interrupted him, saying: Nay, thou
               didst not lie here to-night. But leave we this, of which my true words are my sole
               witness, and pass we to this of the beating thou sayst thou gavest me, and how thou
               didst
               cut my hair. Never a beating had I from thee, and I bid all that are here, and
               thee among them, look at me, and say if I have any trace of a beating on my person;
               nor
               should I advise thee to dare lay hand upon me; for, by the Holy Rood, I would spoil
               thy
               beauty for thee. Nor didst thou cut my hair, for aught that I saw or felt:
               however, thou didst it, perchance, on such wise that I was not ware thereof: so let
               me see
               whether 'tis cut or no. Then, unveiling herself, she shewed that her hair was uncut
               and entire. Wherefore her brothers and mother now turned to Arriguccio with:
               What means this, Arriguccio? This accords not with what thou gavest us
               to understand thou hadst done; nor know we how thou wilt prove the residue.
            </p>
            <p>Arriguccio was lost, as it were, in a dream, and yet he would fain have spoken; but,
               seeing that what he had thought to prove was
               otherwise, he essayed no reply. So the lady turning to her brothers: I
               see, quoth she, what he would have: he will not be satisfied unless I do what I
               never would otherwise have done, to wit, give you to know what a pitiful caitiff he
               is; as
               now I shall not fail to do.  I make no manner of doubt that, as he has said, even
               so it
               befell, and so he did. How, you shall hear. This worthy man, to whom, worse
               luck! you gave me to wife, a merchant, as he calls himself, and as such would fain
               have
               credit, and who ought to be more temperate than a religious, and more continent than
               a
               girl, lets scarce an evening pass but he goes a boozing in the taverns, and consorting
               
               with this or the other woman of the town; and 'tis for me to await his return
               until midnight or sometimes until matins, even as you now find me. I doubt not
               that, being thoroughly well drunk, he got him to bed with one of these wantons, and,
               awaking, found the packthread on her foot, and afterwards did actually perform all
               these
               brave exploits of which he speaks, and in the end came back to her, and
               beat her, and cut her hair off, and being not yet quite recovered from his debauch,
               believed, and, I doubt not, still believes, that 'twas I that he thus treated; and
               if you
               will but scan his face closely, you will see that he is still half drunk. But,
               whatever he may have said about me, I would have you account it as nothing more than
               the
               disordered speech of a tipsy man; and forgive him as I do. Whereupon the
               lady's mother raised no small outcry, saying: By the Holy Rood, my daughter, this may
               not be! A daughter, such as thou, to be mated with one so unworthy of thee! The pestilent,
               insensate cur should be slain on the spot! A pretty state of things, indeed! Why,
               he might
               have picked thee up from the gutter! Now foul fall him!  but thou shalt no more
               be vexed with the tedious drivel of a petty dealer in ass's dung, some blackguard,
               belike,
               that came hither from the country because he was dismissed the service of some petty
               squire, clad in romagnole, with belfry-breeches, and a pen in his arse, and, for that
               he
               has a few pence, must needs have a gentleman's daughter,
               and a fine lady to wife, and set up a coat of arms, and say: 'I am of the such
               and such,' and 'my ancestors did thus and thus.' Ah!  had my sons but followed my
               advice!
               Thy honour were safe in the house of the Counts Guidi, where they might have bestowed
               thee, though thou hadst but a morsel of bread to thy dowry: but they must needs give
               thee
               to this rare treasure, who, though better daughter and more chaste there is none than
               thou
               in <span class="place">Florence</span>, has not blushed this very midnight and in our presence to call thee a
               strumpet, as if we knew thee not. God's faith! so I were hearkened
               to, he should shrewdly smart for it. Then, turning to her sons, she said:
               My sons, I told you plainly enough that this ought not to be.  Now, have you heard
               how
               your worthy brother-in-law treats your sister?  Petty twopenny trader that he is:
               were it
               for me to act, as it is for you, after what he has said of her and done to her, nought
               would satisfy or appease me, till I had rid the earth of him. And were I a man, who
               am but
               a woman, none other but myself should meddle with the affair.  God's curse
               upon him, the woeful, shameless sot! Whereupon the young men, incensed by
               what they had seen and heard, turned to Arriguccio, and after giving him the soundest
               rating that ever was bestowed upon caitiff, concluded as follows: This once we pardon
               thee, witting thee to be a drunken knave: but as thou holdest thy life dear, have
               a care
               that
               henceforth we hear no such tales of thee; for rest assured that if aught of the kind
               do
               reach our ears, we will requite thee for both turns. Which said, they
               departed. Arriguccio, standing there like one dazed, not witting whether his
               late doings were actual fact or but a dream, made no more words about the matter,
               but left
               his wife in peace. Thus did she by her address not only escape imminent peril, but
               open a
               way whereby in time to come she was able to gratify her passion to the full without
               any
               farther fear of her husband.

            <p>In <span class="place">Argos</span>, that most ancient city of <span class="place">Achaia</span>, the fame of whose kings of old
               time is out of all proportion to its size, there dwelt of yore Nicostratus, a nobleman,
               to
               whom, when he was already verging on old age, Fortune gave to wife a great lady, Lydia
               by
               name, whose courage matched her charms. Nicostratus, as suited with his rank
               and wealth, kept not a few retainers and hounds and hawks, and was
               mightily addicted to the chase. Among his dependants was a young man named Pyrrhus,
               a
               gallant of no mean accomplishment, and goodly of person and beloved and trusted by
               Nicostratus above all other. Of whom Lydia grew mighty enamoured,
               insomuch that neither by day nor by night might her thoughts stray from him: but,
               whether
               it was that Pyrrhus wist not her love, or would have none of it, he gave no sign of
               recognition; whereby the lady's suffering waxing more than she could bear, she
               made up her mind to declare her love to him; and having a chambermaid, <span class="person">Lusca</span> by name, in
               whom she placed great trust, she called her, and said: <span class="person">Lusca</span>,
               tokens thou hast had from me of my regard that should ensure thy obedience and loyalty;
               wherefore have a care that what I shall now tell thee reach the ears of none but him
               to
               whom I shall bid thee impart it. Thou seest, <span class="person">Lusca</span>, that I am in the prime of
               my youth and lustihead, and have neither lack nor stint of all such things as folk
               desire,
               save only, to be brief, that I have one cause to repine, to wit, that my husband's
               years
               so far outnumber my own. Wherefore with that wherein young ladies take most
               pleasure I am but ill provided, and, as my desire is no less than theirs, 'tis now
               some
               while since I determined that, if Fortune has shewn herself so little friendly to
               me by
               giving me a husband so advanced in years, at least I will not be mine own enemy by
               sparing
               to devise the means whereby my happiness and health may be assured; and that
               herein, as in all other
               matters, my joy may be complete, I have chosen, thereto to minister by his embraces,
               our
               Pyrrhus, deeming him more worthy than any other man, and have so set my heart upon
               him
               that I am ever ill at ease save when he is present either to my sight or to my mind,
               insomuch that, unless I forgather with him without delay, I doubt not that 'twill
               be the
               death of me. And so, if thou holdest my life dear, thou wilt shew him my love
               on such wise as thou mayst deem best, and make my suit to him that he be pleased to
               come
               to me, when thou shalt go to fetch him. That gladly will I, replied
               the chambermaid; and as soon as she found convenient time and place, she drew Pyrrhus
               apart, and, as best she knew how, conveyed her lady's message to him. Which Pyrrhus
               found
               passing strange to hear, for 'twas in truth a complete surprise to him, and he doubted
               the lady did but mean to try him. Wherefore he presently, and with some asperity,
               answered
               thus: <span class="person">Lusca</span>, believe I cannot that this message comes from my lady: have a
               care, therefore, what thou sayst, and if, perchance, it does come from her, I doubt
               she
               does not mean it; and if, perchance, she does mean it, why, then I am honoured
               by my lord above what I deserve, and I would not for my life do him such a wrong:
               so have
               a care never to speak of such matters to me again. <span class="person">Lusca</span>, nowise
               disconcerted by his uncompliant tone, rejoined: I shall speak to thee, Pyrrhus, of
               these and all other matters, wherewith I may be commissioned by my lady, as often
               as she
               shall bid me, whether it pleases or irks thee; but thou art a blockhead.
            </p>
            <p>So,
               somewhat chafed, <span class="person">Lusca</span> bore Pyrrhus' answer back to her lady, who would fain have died,
               when she heard it, and some days afterwards resumed the topic, saying: Thou
               knowest, <span class="person">Lusca</span>, that 'tis not the first stroke that fells the oak; wherefore, methinks,
               thou wert best go back to this strangeman, who is minded to evince his loyalty at
               my
               expense, and choosing a convenient time, declare to him all my passion, and do thy
               best
               endeavour that the affair be carried through; for if it should thus lapse, 'twould
               be the
               death of me; besides which, he would think we had but trifled with him, and, whereas
               'tis
               his love we would have, we should earn his hatred. So, after comforting the
               lady, the maid hied her in quest of Pyrrhus,
               whom she found in a gladsome and propitious mood, and thus addressed: 'Tis not many
               days, Pyrrhus, since I declared to thee how ardent is the flame with which thy lady
               and
               mine is consumed for love of thee, and now again I do thee to wit thereof, and that,
               if
               thou shalt not relent of the harshness that thou didst manifest the other day, thou
               mayst
               rest assured that her life will be short: wherefore I pray thee to be pleased to give
               her
               solace of her desire, and shouldst thou persist in thy obduracy, I, that gave thee
               credit
               for not a little sense, shall deem thee a great fool. How flattered thou
               shouldst be to know thyself beloved above all else by a lady so beauteous and high-born!
               And how indebted shouldst thou feel thyself to Fortune, seeing that she has in
               store for thee a boon so great and so suited to the cravings of thy youth, ay, and
               so like
               to be of service to thee upon occasion of need! Bethink thee, if there be any
               of thine equals whose life is ordered more agreeably than thine will be if thou but
               be
               wise. Which of them wilt thou find so well furnished with arms and horses, clothes
               and
               money as thou shalt be, if thou but give my lady thy love? Receive, then, my
               words with open mind; be thyself again; bethink thee that 'tis Fortune's way to confront
               a
               man but once with smiling mien and open lap, and, if he then accept not her
               bounty, he has but himself to blame, if afterward he find himself in want, in
               beggary. Besides which, no such loyalty is demanded between servants and their
               masters as between friends and kinsfolk; rather 'tis for servants, so far as they
               may, to
               behave towards their masters as their masters behave towards them. Thinkest
               thou, that, if thou hadst a fair wife or mother or daughter or sister that found favour
               in
               Nicostratus' eyes, he would be so scrupulous on the point of loyalty as thou art disposed
               to be in regard of his lady?  Thou art a fool, if so thou dost believe. Hold it
               for certain, that, if blandishments and supplications did not suffice, he would, whatever
               thou mightest think of it, have recourse to force. Observe we, then, towards
               them and theirs the same rule which they observe towards us and ours. Take the boon
               that
               Fortune offers thee; repulse her not; rather go thou to meet her, and hail her advance;
               for be sure that, if thou do not so, to say nought of thy lady's death, which will
               certainly ensue, thou thyself wilt repent thee thereof so often that
               thou wilt be fain of death.
            </p>
            <p>Since he had last seen <span class="person">Lusca</span>, Pyrrhus had
               repeatedly pondered what she had said to him, and had made his mind up that, should
               she
               come again, he would answer her in another sort, and comply in all respects with the
               lady's desires, provided he might be assured that she was not merely putting him to
               the
               proof; wherefore he now made answer: Lo, now, <span class="person">Lusca</span>, I acknowledge the truth
               of all that thou
               sayst; but, on the other hand, I know that my lord is not a little wise and wary,
               and, as
               he has committed all his affairs to my charge, I sorely misdoubt me that 'tis with
               his
               approbation, and by his advice, and but to prove me, that Lydia does this:
               wherefore let her do three things which I shall demand of her for my assurance,
               and then there is nought that she shall crave of me, but I will certainly render her
               prompt obedience. Which three things are these: first, let her in Nicostratus'
               presence kill his fine sparrow-hawk: then she must send me a lock of Nicostratus'
               beard,
               and lastly one of his best teeth. Hard seemed these terms to <span class="person">Lusca</span>, and
               hard beyond measure to the lady, but Love, that great fautor of enterprise, and master
               of
               stratagem, gave her resolution to address herself to their performance: wherefore
               through
               the chambermaid she sent him word that what he required of her she would do, and that
               without either reservation or delay; and therewithal she told him, that, as he deemed
               Nicostratus so wise, she would contrive that they should enjoy one another in
               Nicostratus' presence, and that Nicostratus should believe that 'twas a mere show.
               Pyrrhus, therefore, anxiously expected what the lady would do. Some days thus
               passed, and then Nicostratus gave a great breakfast, as was his frequent wont, to
               certain
               gentlemen, and when the tables were removed, the lady, robed in green samite, and
               richly
               adorned, came forth of her chamber into the hall wherein they sate, and before the
               eyes of
               Pyrrhus and all the rest of the company hied her to the perch, on which stood the
               sparrow-hawk that Nicostratus so much prized, and loosed him, and, as if she were
               minded
               to carry him on her hand, took him by the jesses and dashed him against the wall so
               that
               he died. Whereupon: Alas! my lady, what hast thou done? exclaimed
               Nicostratus: but she vouchsafed no answer, save that,
               turning to the gentlemen that had sate at meat with him, she said: My lords, ill fitted
               were I to take vengeance on a king that had done me despite, if I lacked the courage
               to be
               avenged on a sparrowhawk.  You are to know that by this bird I have long been
               cheated of all the time that ought to be devoted by gentlemen to pleasuring their
               ladies;
               for with the first streaks of dawn Nicostratus has been up and got him to horse, and
               hawk
               on hand hied him to the champaign to see him fly, leaving me, such as you see me,
               alone
               and ill content abed. For which cause I have oftentimes been minded to do that
               which I have now done, and have only refrained therefrom, that, biding my time, I
               might do
               it in the presence of men that should judge my cause justly, as I trust you will do.
               Which hearing, the gentlemen, who deemed her affections no less fixed on
               Nicostratus than her words imported, broke with one accord into a laugh,
               and turning to Nicostratus, who was sore displeased, fell a saying: Now well done of
               the lady to avenge her wrongs by the death of the sparrow-hawk! and so, the lady being
               withdrawn to her chamber, they passed the affair off with divers pleasantries, turning
               the
               wrath of Nicostratus to laughter.
            </p>
            <p>Pyrrhus, who had witnessed what had passed, said
               to himself: Nobly indeed has my lady begun, and on such wise as promises well for
               the
               felicity of my love. God grant that she so continue.  And even so Lydia did:
               for not many days after she had killed the
               sparrow-hawk, she, being with Nicostratus in her chamber, from caressing passed to
               toying
               and trifling with him, and he, sportively pulling her by the hair, gave her
               occasion to fulfil the second of
               Pyrrhus' demands; which she did by nimbly laying hold of one of the lesser tufts of
               his
               beard, and, laughing the while, plucking it so hard that she tore it out of his
               chin. Which Nicostratus somewhat resenting: Now what cause hast thou,
               quoth she, to make such a wry face? 'Tis but that I have plucked some half-dozen hairs
               from thy beard. Thou didst not feel it as much as did I but now thy tugging of my
               hair. And so they continued jesting and sporting with one another, the lady
               jealously guarding the tuft that she had torn from the beard, which the very same
               day she
               sent to her cherished lover. The third demand caused the lady more thought;
               but, being amply endowed with wit, and powerfully seconded
               by Love, she failed not to hit upon an apt expedient.
            </p>
            <p>Nicostratus had in his service two lads, who, being of gentle birth, had been placed
               with him by their kinsfolk, that they might learn manners, one of whom, when Nicostratus
               sate at meat, carved before him, while the other gave him to drink. Both lads Lydia
               called
               to her, and gave them to understand that their breath smelt, and admonished them that,
               when they waited on Nicostratus, they should hold their heads as far back as possible,
               saying never a word of the matter to any. The lads believing her, did as she
               bade them. Whereupon she took occasion to say to Nicostratus: Hast thou marked what
               these lads do when they wait upon thee? Troth, that have I, replied
               Nicostratus; indeed I have often had it in mind to ask them why they do so.
               Nay, rejoined the lady, spare thyself the pains; for I can tell thee
               the reason, which I have for some time kept close, lest it should vex thee; but as
               I now
               see that others begin to be ware of it, it need no longer be withheld from
               thee. 'Tis for that thy breath stinks shrewdly that they thus avert their heads
               from thee: 'twas not wont to be so, nor know I why it should be so; and 'tis most
               offensive when thou art in converse with gentlemen; and therefore 'twould be well
               to find
               some way of curing it. I wonder what it could be, returned
               Nicostratus; is it perchance that I have a decayed tooth in my jaw?
               That may well be, quoth Lydia: and taking him to a window, she caused
               him open his mouth, and after regarding it on this side and that: Oh!
               Nicostratus, quoth she, how couldst thou have endured it so long? Thou hast a tooth
               here, which, by what I see, is not only decayed, but actually rotten
               throughout; and beyond all manner of doubt, if thou let it remain long in thy head,
               'twill
               infect its neighbours; so 'tis my advice that thou out with it before the matter grows
               worse. My judgment jumps with thine, quoth Nicostratus; wherefore
               send without delay for a chirurgeon to draw it. God forbid, returned
               the lady, that chirurgeon come hither for such a purpose; methinks, the case is such
               that I can very well dispense with him, and draw the tooth myself. Besides
               which, these chirurgeons do these things in such a cruel way, that I could never endure
               to
               see thee or know thee under the hands of any of them: wherefore my mind is quite made
               up
               to do it myself, that, at least, if thou shalt suffer too much, I may give it over
               at
               once, as a chirurgeon would not do. And so she caused the instruments that
               are used on such occasions to be brought her, and having dismissed all other attendants
               save <span class="person">Lusca</span> from the chamber, and locked the door, made Nicostratus lie down on a table,
               set the pincers in his mouth, and clapped them on one of his teeth, which, while <span class="person">Lusca</span>
               held him, so that, albeit he roared for pain, he might not move, she wrenched by main
               force from his jaw, and keeping it close, took from <span class="person">Lusca</span>'s hand another and
               horribly decayed tooth, which she shewed him, suffering and half dead as he was, saying:
               See what thou hadst in thy jaw; mark how far gone it is. Believing what
               she said, and deeming that, now the tooth was out, his breath would no more be offensive,
               and being somewhat eased of the pain, which had been extreme, and still remained,
               so that
               he murmured not little, by divers comforting applications, he quitted the chamber:
               whereupon the lady forthwith sent the tooth to her lover, who, having now full
               assurance of her love, placed himself entirely at her service. But the lady
               being
               minded to make his assurance yet more sure, and deeming each hour a thousand till
               she
               might be with him, now saw fit, for the more ready performance of the promise she
               had
               given him, to feign sickness; and Nicostratus, coming to see her one day after breakfast,
               attended only by Pyrrhus, she besought him for her better solacement, to help her
               down to
               the garden. Wherefore Nicostratus on one side, and Pyrrhus on the other, took
               her and bore her down to the garden, and set her on a lawn at the foot of a beautiful
               pear-tree: and after they had sate there a while, the lady, who had already given Pyrrhus to understand what he must do, said to him: Pyrrhus, I should
               greatly like to have some of those pears; get thee up the tree, and shake some of
               them
               down. Pyrrhus climbed the tree in a trice, and began to shake down the
               pears, and while he did so: Fie! Sir, quoth he, what is this you do? And you,
               Madam, have you no shame, that you suffer him to do so in my presence?  Think you
               that I
               am blind? 'Twas but now that you were gravely indisposed.  Your cure has been speedy
               indeed to permit of your so behaving: and as for such a purpose you have so many goodly
               chambers, why betake you not yourselves to one of them, if you must needs so disport
               yourselves?  'Twould be much more decent than to do so in my presence.
               Whereupon the lady, turning to her husband: Now what can Pyrrhus mean?
               said she. Is he mad? Nay, Madam, quoth Pyrrhus; mad am not I.
               Think you I see you not? Whereat Nicostratus marvelled not a little; and:
               Pyrrhus, quoth he, I verily believe thou dreamest. Nay, my
               lord, replied Pyrrhus, not a whit do I dream; neither do you; rather you wag it
               with such vigour, that, if this pear-tree did the like, there would be never a pear
               left
               on it. Then the lady: What can this mean? quoth she: can it be
               that it really seems to him to be as he says? Upon my hope of salvation, were I but
               in my
               former health, I would get me up there to judge for myself what these wonders are
               which he
               professes to see. Whereupon, as Pyrrhus in the pear-tree continued talking
               in the same strange strain: Come down, quoth Nicostratus;
               and when he was down: Now what, said Nicostratus, is it thou sayst thou seest up
               there? I suppose, replied Pyrrhus, that you take me to be deluded
               or dreaming: but as I must needs tell you the truth, I saw you lying upon your wife,
               and
               then, when I came down, I saw you get up and sit you down here where you now are.
               Therein, said Nicostratus, thou wast certainly deluded, for, since
               thou clombest the pear-tree, we have not budged a jot, save as thou seest.
               Then said Pyrrhus: Why make more words about the matter? See you I certainly
               did; and, seeing you, I saw you lying upon your own. Nicostratus' wonder
               now waxed momently, insomuch that he said: I am minded to see if this
               pear-tree be enchanted, so that whoso is in it sees marvels; and so he got him up into
               it. Whereupon the lady and Pyrrhus fell to disporting them, and Nicostratus,
               seeing what they were about, exclaimed: Ah! lewd woman, what is this thou doest? And
               thou, Pyrrhus, in whom I so much trusted! And so saying, he began to climb
               down. Meanwhile the lady and Pyrrhus had made answer: We are sitting
               here: and seeing him descending, they placed themselves as they had been when he had
               left them, whom Nicostratus, being come down, no sooner saw, than he fell a
               rating them. Then quoth Pyrrhus: Verily, Nicostratus, I now acknowledge,
               that, as you said a while ago, what I saw when I was in the pear-tree was but a false
               show, albeit I had never understood that so it was but that I now see and know that
               thou
               hast also seen a false show. And that I speak truth, you may sufficiently
               assure yourself, if you but reflect whether 'tis likely that your wife, who for virtue
               and
               discretion has not her peer among women, would, if she were minded so to dishonour
               you,
               see fit to do so before your very eyes. Of myself I say nought, albeit I had liefer
               be
               hewn in pieces than that I should so much as think of such a thing, much less do it
               in
               your presence. Wherefore 'tis evident
               that 'tis some illusion of sight that is propagated from the pear-tree;
               for nought in the world would have made me believe that I saw not you lying there
               in
               carnal intercourse with your wife, had I not heard you say that you saw me doing that
               which most assuredly, so far from doing, I never so much as thought of. The
               lady then started up with a most resentful mien, and burst out with: Foul fall thee, if
               thou knowest so little of me as to suppose that, if I were minded to do thee such
               foul
               dishonour as thou sayst thou didst see me do, I would come hither to do it before
               thine
               eyes! Rest assured that for such a purpose, were it ever mine, I should deem
               one of our chambers more meet, and it should go hard but I would so order the matter
               that
               thou shouldst never know aught of it. Nicostratus, having heard both, and
               deeming that what they both
               
               averred must be true, to wit, that they would never have ventured upon such an act
               in his
               presence, passed from chiding to talk of the
               
               singularity of the thing, and how marvellous it was that the vision should reshape
               itself
               for every one that clomb the tree. The lady, however, made a show of being
               distressed that Nicostratus should so have thought of her, and: Verily, quoth she,
               no woman, neither I nor another, shall again suffer loss of honour by this pear-tree: run, Pyrrhus, and bring hither an axe, and at one and the
               same time vindicate thy honour and mine by felling it, albeit 'twere better far
               Nicostratus' skull should feel the weight of the axe, seeing that in utter heedlessness
               he
               so readily suffered the eyes of his mind to be blinded; for, albeit this vision was
               seen
               by the bodily eye, yet ought the understanding by no means to have entertained and
               affirmed it as real.
            </p>
            <p>So Pyrrhus presently hied him to fetch the axe, and
               returning therewith felled the pear; whereupon the lady, turning towards Nicostratus:
               Now that this foe of my honour is fallen, quoth she, my wrath is gone from
               me. Nicostratus then craving her pardon, she graciously granted it him, bidding him
               never again to suffer himself to be betrayed into thinking such a thing of her, who
               loved
               him more dearly than herself. So the poor duped husband went back with her and
               her lover to the palace, where not seldom in time to come Pyrrhus and Lydia took their
               pastime together more at ease. God grant us the like.

            <p>Two Sienese love a lady, one of them being
               her gossip: the gossip dies, having promised his comrade to return to him from the
               other
               world; which he does, and tells him what sort of life is led
               there.
            </p>
            <div class="frame">
               <p>None now was left to tell, save
                  	the king, who, as soon as the ladies had ceased mourning over the fall of the pear-tree,
                  	that had done no wrong, and were silent, began thus:
               </p>
            </div>
            <div class="frame">
               <p>Most manifest it is that
                  'tis the prime duty of a just king to observe the laws that he has made; and, if he
                  do not
                  so, he is to be esteemed no king, but a slave that has merited punishment, into which
                  fault, and under which condemnation, I, your king, must, as of necessity,
                  fall. For, indeed, when yesterday I made the law which governs our discourse of
                  to-day, I thought not to-day to avail myself of my privilege, but to submit to the
                  law, no
                  less than you, and to discourse of the same topic whereof you all have discoursed;
                  but not only has the very story
                  been told which I had intended to tell, but therewithal so many things else, and so
                  very
                  much goodlier have been said, that, search my memory as I may, I cannot mind me of
                  aught,
                  nor wot I that touching such a matter there is indeed aught, for me to say, that would
                  be
                  comparable with what has been said; wherefore, as infringe I must the law that
                  I myself have made, I confess myself worthy of punishment, and instantly declaring
                  my
                  readiness to pay any forfeit that may be demanded of me, am minded to have recourse
                  to my
                  wonted privilege. And such, dearest ladies, is the potency of Elisa's story of
                  the godfather and his gossip, and therewith of the simplicity of the Sienese, that
                  I am
                  prompted thereby to pass from this topic of the beguilement of foolish husbands by
                  their
                  cunning wives to a
                  little story touching these same Sienese, which, albeit there is not a little
                  therein which you were best not to believe, may yet be in
                  some degree entertaining to hear.

            </div>
            <p>Know, then, that at <span class="place">Siena</span> there dwelt in Porta
               Salaia two young men of the people, named, the one, Tingoccio Mini, the other Meuccio
               di
               Tura, who, by what appeared, loved one another not a little, for they were scarce
               ever out
               of one another's company; and being wont, like other folk, to go to church and
               listen to sermons, they heard from time to time of the glory and the woe, which in
               the
               other world are allotted, according to merit, to the souls of the dead.  Of which
               matters
               craving, but being unable to come by, more certain assurance, they agreed together
               that,
               whichever of them should die first, should, if he might, return to the survivor, and
               certify him of that which he would fain know; and this agreement they confirmed with
               an
               oath. Now, after they had made this engagement, and while they were still
               constantly together, Tingoccio chanced to become sponsor to one Ambruogio Anselmini,
               that
               dwelt in Campo Reggi, who had had a son by his wife, Monna Mita. The lady was
               exceeding fair, and amorous withal, and Tingoccio being wont sometimes to visit her
               as his
               gossip, and to take Meuccio with him, he,
               notwithstanding his sponsorship, grew enamoured of her, as did also
               Meuccio, for she pleased him not a little, and he heard her much commended by
               Tingoccio. Which love each concealed from the other; but not for the same
               reason. Tingoccio was averse to discover it to Meuccio, for that he deemed it an
               ignominious thing to love his gossip, and was ashamed to let any one know it. Meuccio
               was
               on his guard for a very different reason, to wit, that he was already ware that the
               lady
               was in Tingoccio's good graces. Wherefore he said to himself: If I avow my love
               to him, he will be jealous of me, and as, being her gossip, he can speak with her
               as
               often as he pleases, he will do all he can to make her hate me, and so I shall never
               have
               any favour of her.
            </p>
            <p>Now, the two young men being thus, as I have said, on terms of
               most familiar friendship, it befell that Tingoccio, being the better able to open
               his
               heart to the lady, did so order his demeanour and discourse that he had from her all
               that
               he desired. Nor was his friend's success hidden from Meuccio; though, much as it vexed
               him, yet still cherishing the hope of eventually attaining his end, and 
               fearing to give Tingoccio occasion to baulk or hamper him in some way, he feigned
               to know nought of the matter. So Tingoccio, more fortunate than his comrade,
               and rival in love, did with such assiduity till his gossip's good land that he got
               thereby
               a malady, which in the course of some days waxed so grievous that he succumbed thereto,
               and departed this life. And on the night of the third day after his
               decease (perchance because earlier he might not) he made his appearance,
               according to his promise, in Meuccio's chamber, and called Meuccio, who was fast asleep,
               by his name. Whereupon: Who art thou? quoth Meuccio, as he
               awoke. 'Tis I, Tingoccio, replied he, come back, in fulfilment of the
               pledge I gave thee, to give thee tidings of the other world. For a while
               Meuccio saw him not without terror: then, his courage reviving: Welcome, my
               brother, quoth he: and proceeded to ask him if he were lost.  Nought is
               lost but what is irrecoverable, replied Tingoccio: how then should I be here, if I
               were lost? Nay, quoth then Meuccio; I mean it not so: I would
               know of thee, whether thou art of the number of the souls that are condemned to the
               penal
               fire of hell. Why no, returned Tingoccio, not just that; but
               still for the sins that I did I am in most sore and grievous torment.
               Meuccio then questioned Tingoccio in detail of the pains there meted out for
               each of the sins done here; and Tingoccio enumerated them all.  Whereupon Meuccio
               asked if
               there were aught he might do for him
               here on earth. Tingoccio answered in the affirmative; to wit, that he might have masses
               and prayers said and alms-deeds done for him, for that such things were of great service
               to the souls there. That gladly will I, replied Meuccio; and then, as
               Tingoccio was about to take his leave, he bethought him of the gossip, and raising
               his
               head a little, he said: I mind me, Tingoccio, of the gossip, with whom thou wast wont
               to lie when thou wast here. Now what is thy punishment for that? My
               brother, returned Tingoccio, as soon as I got down there, I met one that seemed to
               know all my sins by heart, who bade me betake me to a place, where, while in direst
               torment I bewept my sins, I found comrades not a few condemned to the same pains;
               and so,
               standing there among them, and calling to mind what I had done with the gossip, and
               foreboding in
               requital thereof a much greater torment than had yet been allotted me, albeit I was
               in a
               great and most vehement flame, I quaked for fear in every part of
               me. Which one that was beside me observing:
               'What,' quoth he, 'hast thou done more than the rest of us that are here, that thou
               quakest thus as thou standest in the fire?' 'My friend,' quoth I, 'I am in mortal
               fear of
               the doom that I expect for a great sin that I once committed.' He then asked
               what sin it might be. ''Twas on this wise,' replied I: 'I lay with my gossip, and
               that so
               much that I died thereof.'  Whereat, he did but laugh, saying: 'Go to, fool,
               make thy mind easy; for here there is no account taken of gossips.' Which completely
               revived my drooping spirits.
            </p>
            <p>'Twas now near daybreak: wherefore: Adieu! Meuccio, quoth his friend: for
               longer tarry with thee I may not; and so he vanished. As for Meuccio,
               having learned that no account was taken of gossips in the other world, he began to
               laugh
               at his own folly in that he had already spared divers such; and so, being quit of
               his
               ignorance, he in that respect in course of time waxed wise.  Which matters had Fra
               Rinaldo
               but known, he would not have
               needed to go about syllogizing in order to bring his fair gossip to
               pleasure him.

            <h3 class="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The sun was westering, and a light breeze blew,
               when the king, his story ended, and none else being left to speak, arose, and taking
               off
               the crown, set it on <span class="person">Lauretta</span>'s head, saying: Madam, I crown you with yourselfA
               play upon laurea (laurel wreath) and <span class="person">Lauretta</span>. queen of our
               company: 'tis now for you, as our sovereign lady, to make such ordinances as you shall
               deem meet for our common solace and delectation; and having so said, he sat him
               down again. Queen <span class="person">Lauretta</span> sent for the seneschal, and bade him have a care
               that the tables should be set in the pleasant vale somewhat earlier than had been
               their
               wont, that their return to the palace might be more leisurely; after which she gave
               him to
               know what else he had to do during her sovereignty. Then turning to the
               company: Yesterday, quoth she, <span class="person">Dioneo</span> would have it that to-day we should
               discourse of the tricks that wives play their husbands; and but that I am minded not
               to
               shew as of the breed of yelping curs, that are ever prompt to retaliate, I would ordain
               that to-morrow we discourse of the tricks that husbands play their wives.
               However, in lieu thereof, I will have every one take thought to tell of those
               tricks that, daily, woman plays man, or man woman, or one man another;
               wherein, I doubt not, there will be matter of discourse no less agreeable than has
               been
               that of to-day. So saying, she rose and dismissed the company until
               supper-time. So the ladies and the men being risen, some bared their feet and
               betook them to the clear water, there to disport them, while others took their pleasure
               upon the green lawn amid the trees that there grew goodly and straight. For no
               brief
               while <span class="person">Dioneo</span> and <span class="person">Fiammetta</span> sang in concert of Arcite and Palamon.  And so, each and all
               taking their several pastimes, they sped the hours with exceeding great delight until
               supper-time. Which being come, they sat them down at table beside the little lake,
               and
               there, while a thousand songsters charmed their ears, and a gentle breeze, that blew
               from
               the environing hills, fanned them, and never a fly annoyed them, reposefully and joyously
               they supped. The tables removed, they roved a while about the pleasant vale,
               and then, the sun being still high, for 'twas but half vespers, the queen gave the
               word,
               and they wended their way back to their wonted abode, and going slowly, and beguiling
               the
               way with quips and quirks without number upon divers matters, nor those alone of which
               they had that day discoursed, they arrived, hard upon nightfall, at the goodly palace.
               There, the short walk's fatigue dispelled by wines most cool and
               comfits, they presently gathered for the dance about the fair fountain,
               and now they footed it to the strains of <span class="person">Tindaro</span>'s cornemuse, and now to other
               music. Which done, the queen bade <span class="person">Filomena</span> give them a song; and thus <span class="person">Filomena</span>
               sang:
            </p>
            <div class="song">Ah! woe
               is me, my soul!
               Ah! shall I ever thither fare again
               Whence I
               was parted to my grievous dole?Full sure I know not; but
               within my breast
               Throbs ever the same fire
               Of yearning there
               where erst I was to be.
               O thou in whom is all my weal, my
               rest,
               Lord of my heart's desire,
               Ah! tell me thou! for none
               to ask save thee
               Neither dare I, nor see.
               Ah! dear my Lord,
               this wasted heart disdain
               Thou wilt not, but with hope at length
               console.Kindled the flame I know not what
               delight,
               Which me doth so devour,
               That day and night alike I
               find no ease;
               For whether it was by hearing, touch, or
               sight,
               Unwonted was the power,
               And fresh the fire that me
               each way did seize;
               Wherein without release
               I languish still,
               and of thee, Lord, am fain,
               For thou alone canst comfort and make
               whole.Ah! tell me if it shall be, and how
               soon,
               That I again thee meet
               Where those death-dealing eyes I
               kissed. Thou, chief
               Weal of my soul, my very soul, this
               boon
               Deny not; say that fleet
               Thou hiest hither: comfort thus
               my grief.
               Ah! let the time be brief
               Till thou art here, and
               then long time remain;
               For I, Love-stricken, crave but Love's
               control.Let me but once again mine own thee
               call,
               No more so indiscreet
               As erst, I'll be, to let thee
               from me part:
               Nay, I'll still hold thee, let what may
               befall,
               And of thy mouth so sweet
               Such solace take as may
               content my heart:
               So this be all my art,
               Thee to entice, me
               with thine arms to enchain:
               Whereon but musing inly chants my
               soul.
            </div>
            <p>This song set all the company conjecturing what new and delightsome love might now
               hold
               <span class="person">Filomena</span> in its sway; and as its words imported that she had had more joyance thereof than
               sight alone
               
               might yield, some that were there grew envious of her excess of happiness.  However,
               the
               song being ended, the queen, bethinking her that the morrow was Friday, thus graciously
               addressed them all: Ye wot, noble ladies, and ye also, my gallants, that
               to-morrow is the day that is sacred to the passion of our Lord, which, if ye remember,
               we
               kept devoutly when <span class="person">Neifile</span> was queen, intermitting delectable discourse, as we did also on
               the ensuing Saturday.  Wherefore, being minded to follow <span class="person">Neifile</span>'s
               excellent example, I deem that now, as then, 'twere a seemly thing to surcease from
               this
               our pastime of story-telling for those two days, and compose our minds to meditation
               on
               what was at that season accomplished for the weal of our souls. All the
               company having approved their queen's devout speech, she, as the night was now far
               spent,
               dismissed them; and so they all betook them to slumber.
