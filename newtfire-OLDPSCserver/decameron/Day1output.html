            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p n="11">As often, most gracious ladies, as I bethink me, how compassionate
               you are by nature one and all, I do not disguise from
               myself that the present work must seem to you to have but a
               heavy and distressful prelude, in that it bears upon its very front
               what must needs revive the sorrowful memory of the late mortal
               pestilence, the course whereof was grievous not merely to eyewitnesses
               but to all who in any other wise had cognisance of it.
               But I would have you know, that you need not therefore be fearful
               to read further, as if your reading were ever to be accompanied
               by sighs and tears. This horrid beginning will be to you even
               such as to wayfarers is a steep and rugged mountain, beyond which
               stretches a plain most fair and delectable, which the toil of the ascent
               and descent does but serve to render more agreeable to them; for, as
               the last degree of joy brings with it sorrow, so misery has ever its
               sequel of happiness. To this brief exordium of woe--brief, I say,
               inasmuch as it can be put within the compass of a few letters--succeed
               forthwith the sweets and delights which I have promised you, and
               which, perhaps, had I not done so, were not to have been expected
               from it. In truth, had it been honestly possible to guide you whither
               I would bring you by a road less rough than this will be, I would
               gladly have so done. But, because without this review of the past, it
               would not be in my power to shew how the matters, of which you
               will hereafter read, came to pass, I am almost bound of necessity to
               enter upon it, if I would write of them at all.
            </p>
            <p n="12">I say, then, that the years of the beatific incarnation of the Son
               of God had reached the tale of one thousand three hundred and
               forty-eight, when in the illustrious city of <span class="place">Florence</span>, the fairest of all
               the cities of <span class="place">Italy</span>, there made its appearance that deadly pestilence,
               which, whether disesminated by the influence of the celestial bodies,
               or sent upon us mortals by God in His just wrath by way of
               retribution for our iniquities, had had its origin some years before in
               the East, whence, after destroying an innumerable multitude of living
               beings, it had propagated itself without respite from place to place,
               and so, calamitously, had spread into the West.
            </p>
            <p n="13">In <span class="place">Florence</span>, despite all that human wisdom and forethought could
               devise to avert it, as the cleansing of the city from many impurities
               by officials appointed for the purpose, the refusal of entrance to all
               sick folk, and the adoption of many precautions for the preservation
               of health; despite also humble supplications addressed to God, and
               often repeated both in public procession and otherwise, by the devout;
               towards the beginning of the spring of the said year the doleful
               effects of the pestilence began to be horribly apparent by symptoms
               that shewed as if miraculous.
            </p>
            <p n="14">Not such were they as in the East, where an issue of blood from
               the nose was a manifest sign of inevitable death; but in men and
               women alike it first betrayed itself by the emergence of certain
               tumours in the groin or the armpits, some of which grew as large as
               a common apple, others as an egg, some more, some less, which the
               common folk called gavoccioli. From the two said parts of the
               body this deadly gavocciolo soon began to propagate and spread itself
               in all directions indifferently; after which the form of the malady
               began to change, black spots or livid making their appearance in
               many cases on the arm or the thigh or elsewhere, now few and large,
               now minute and numerous. And as the gavocciolo had been and
               still was an infallible token of approaching death, such also were
               these spots on whomsoever they shewed themselves. Which maladies
               seemed to set entirely at naught both the art of the physician and
               the virtues of physic; indeed, whether it was that the disorder was
               of a nature to defy such treatment, or that the physicians were at
               fault--besides the qualified there was now a multitude both of men
               and of women who practised without having received the slightest
               tincture of medical science--and, being in ignorance of its source,
               failed to apply the proper remedies; in either case, not merely were
               those that recovered few, but almost all within three days from the
               appearance of the said symptoms, sooner or later, died, and in most
               cases without any fever or other attendant malady.
            </p>
            <p n="15">Moreover, the virulence of the pest was the greater by reason that
               intercourse was apt to convey it from the sick to the whole, just as
               fire devours things dry or greasy when they are brought close to it.
               Nay, the evil went yet further, for not merely by speech or association
               with the sick was the malady communicated to the healthy with
               consequent peril of common death; but any that touched the clothes
               of the sick or aught else that had been touched or used by them,
               seemed thereby to contract the disease.
            </p>
            <p n="16">So marvellous sounds that which I have now to relate, that, had
               not many, and I among them, observed it with their own eyes, I had
               hardly dared to credit it, much less to set it down in writing, though
               I had had it from the lips of a credible witness.
            </p>
            <p n="17">I say, then, that such was the energy of the contagion of the said
               pestilence, that it was not merely propagated from man to man,
               but, what is much more startling, it was frequently observed, that
               things which had belonged to one sick or dead of the disease, if
               touched by some other living creature, not of the human species,
               were the occasion, not merely of sickening, but of an almost instantaneous
               death. Whereof my own eyes (as I said a little before) had
               cognisance, one day among others, by the following experience. The
               rags of a poor man who had died of the disease being strewn about
               the open street, two hogs came thither, and after, as is their wont,
               no little trifling with their snouts, took the rags between their
               teeth and tossed them to and fro about their chaps; whereupon,
               almost immediately, they gave a few turns, and fell down dead,
               as if by poison, upon the rags which in an evil hour they had
               disturbed.
            </p>
            <p n="18">In which circumstances, not to speak of many others of a similar
               or even graver complexion, divers apprehensions and imaginations
               were engendered in the minds of such as were left alive, inclining
               almost all of them to the same harsh resolution, to wit, to shun and
               abhor all contact with the sick and all that belonged to them,
               thinking thereby to make each his own health secure. Among whom
               there were those who thought that to live temperately and avoid all
               excess would count for much as a preservative against seizures of this
               kind. Wherefore they banded together, and, dissociating themselves
               from all others, formed communities in houses where there were no
               sick, and lived a separate and secluded life, which they regulated with
               the utmost care, avoiding every kind of luxury, but eating and
               drinking very moderately of the most delicate viands and the finest
               wines, holding converse with none but one another, lest tidings of
               sickness or death should reach them, and diverting their minds with
               music and such other delights as they could devise. Others, the bias
               of whose minds was in the opposite direction, maintained, that to
               drink freely, frequent places of public resort, and take their pleasure
               with song and revel, sparing to satisfy no appetite, and to laugh and
               mock at no event, was the sovereign remedy for so great an evil: and
               that which they affirmed they also put in practice, so far as they were
               able, resorting day and night, now to this tavern, now to that, drinking
               with an entire disregard of rule or measure, and by preference making
               the houses of others, as it were, their inns, if they but saw in them
               aught that was particularly to their taste or liking; which they were
               readily able to do, because the owners, seeing death imminent, had
               become as reckless of their property as of their lives; so that most of
               the houses were open to all comers, and no distinction was observed
               between the stranger who presented himself and the rightful lord.
               Thus, adhering ever to their inhuman determination to shun the sick,
               as far as possible, they ordered their life. In this extremity of our
               city's suffering and tribulation the venerable authority of laws,
               human and divine, was abased and all but totally dissolved, for lack
               of those who should have administered and enforced them, most of
               whom, like the rest of the citizens, were either dead or sick, or so
               hard bested for servants that they were unable to execute any
               office; whereby every man was free to do what was right in his
               own eyes.
            </p>
            <p n="19">Not a few there were who belonged to neither of the two said
               parties, but kept a middle course between them, neither laying the
               same restraint upon their diet as the former, nor allowing themselves
               the same license in drinking and other dissipations as the latter, but
               living with a degree of freedom sufficient to satisfy their appetites,
               and not as recluses. They therefore walked abroad, carrying in
               their hands flowers or fragrant herbs or divers sorts of spices, which
               they frequently raised to their noses, deeming it an excellent thing
               thus to comfort the brain with such perfumes, because the air seemed
               to be everywhere laden and reeking with the stench emitted by the
               dead and the dying, and the odours of drugs.
            </p>
            <p n="20">Some again, the most sound, perhaps, in judgment, as they were
               also the most harsh in temper, of all, affirmed that there was no
               medicine for the disease superior or equal in efficacy to flight; following
               which prescription a multitude of men and women, negligent
               of all but themselves, deserted their city, their houses, their estates,
               their kinsfolk, their goods, and went into voluntary exile, or migrated
               to the country parts, as if God in visiting men with this pestilence in
               requital of their iniquities would not pursue them with His wrath
               wherever they might be, but intended the destruction of such alone
               as remained within the circuit of the walls of the city; or deeming,
               perchance, that it was now time for all to flee from it, and that its
               last hour was come.
            </p>
            <p n="21">Of the adherents of these divers opinions not all died, neither did
               all escape; but rather there were, of each sort and in every place, many
               that sickened, and by those who retained their health were treated after
               the example which they themselves, while whole, had set, being everywhere
               left to languish in almost total neglect. Tedious were it to
               recount, how citizen avoided citizen, how among neighbours was
               scarce found any that shewed fellow-feeling for another, how kinsfolk
               held aloof, and never met, or but rarely; enough that this sore affliction
               entered so deep into the minds of men and women, that in the
               horror thereof brother was forsaken by brother, nephew by uncle,
               brother by sister, and oftentimes husband by wife; nay, what is more,
               and scarcely to be believed, fathers and mothers were found to abandon
               their own children, untended, unvisited, to their fate, as if they had
               been strangers. Wherefore the sick of both sexes, whose number
               could not be estimated, were left without resource but in the charity
               of friends (and few such there were), or the interest of servants, who
               were hardly to be had at high rates and on unseemly terms, and
               being, moreover, one and all, men and women of gross understanding,
               and for the most part unused to such offices, concerned themselves
               no further than to supply the immediate and expressed wants of the
               sick, and to watch them die; in which service they themselves not
               seldom perished with their gains. In consequence of which dearth
               of servants and dereliction of the sick by neighbours, kinsfolk and
               friends, it came to pass--a thing, perhaps, never before heard of--that
               no woman, however dainty, fair or well-born she might be,
               shrank, when stricken with the disease, from the ministrations of a
               man, no matter whether he were young or no, or scrupled to expose
               to him every part of her body, with no more shame than if he had
               been a woman, submitting of necessity to that which her malady
               required; wherefrom, perchance, there resulted in after time some
               loss of modesty in such as recovered. Besides which many succumbed,
               who with proper attendance, would, perhaps, have escaped
               death; so that, what with the virulence of the plague and the lack
               of due tendance of the sick, the multitude of the deaths, that daily
               and nightly took place in the city, was such that those who heard
               the tale--not to say witnessed the fact--were struck dumb with
               amazement. Whereby, practices contrary to the former habits of
               the citizens could hardly fail to grow up among the survivors.
            </p>
            <p n="22">It had been, as to-day it still is, the custom for the women that
               were neighbours and of kin to the deceased to gather in his house
               with the women that were most closely connected with him, to
               wail with them in common, while on the other hand his male kinsfolk
               and neighbours, with not a few of the other citizens, and a due
               proportion of the clergy according to his quality, assembled without,
               in front of the house, to receive the corpse; and so the dead man
               was borne on the shoulders of his peers, with funeral pomp of taper
               and dirge, to the church selected by him before his death. Which
               rites, as the pestilence waxed in fury, were either in whole or in
               great part disused, and gave way to others of a novel order. For
               not only did no crowd of women surround the bed of the dying, but
               many passed from this life unregarded, and few indeed were they to
               whom were accorded the lamentations and bitter tears of sorrowing
               relations; nay, for the most part, their place was taken by the laugh,
               the jest, the festal gathering; observances which the women, domestic
               piety in large measure set aside, had adopted with very great
               advantage to their health. Few also there were whose bodies were
               attended to the church by more than ten or twelve of their neighbours,
               and those not the honourable and respected citizens; but a sort
               of corpse-carriers drawn from the baser ranks, who called themselves
               becchiniProbably from the name of the pronged or hooked implement
               with
               which they dragged the corpses out of the houses. and performed such
               offices for hire, would shoulder the
               bier, and with hurried steps carry it, not to the church of the dead
               man's choice, but to that which was nearest at hand, with four or
               six priests in front and a candle or two, or, perhaps, none; nor did
               the priests distress themselves with too long and solemn an office,
               but with the aid of the becchini hastily consigned the corpse to the
               first tomb which they found untenanted. The condition of the
               lower, and, perhaps, in great measure of the middle ranks, of the
               people shewed even worse and more deplorable; for, deluded by
               hope or constrained by poverty, they stayed in their quarters, in their
               houses, where they sickened by thousands a day, and, being without
               service or help of any kind, were, so to speak, irredeemably devoted
               to the death which overtook them. Many died daily or nightly in
               the public streets; of many others, who died at home, the departure
               was hardly observed by their neighbours, until the stench of their
               putrefying bodies carried the tidings; and what with their corpses
               and the corpses of others who died on every hand the whole place
               was a sepulchre.
            </p>
            <p n="23">It was the common practice of most of the neighbours, moved no
               less by fear of contamination by the putrefying bodies than by charity
               towards the deceased, to drag the corpses out of the houses with their
               own hands, aided, perhaps, by a porter, if a porter was to be had, and
               to lay them in front of the doors, where any one who made the
               round might have seen, especially in the morning, more of them than
               he could count; afterwards they would have biers brought up, or, in
               default, planks, whereon they laid them. Nor was it once or twice
               only that one and the same bier carried two or three corpses at once;
               but quite a considerable number of such cases occurred, one bier
               sufficing for husband and wife, two or three brothers, father and son,
               and so forth. And times without number it happened, that, as two
               priests, bearing the cross, were on their way to perform the last office
               for some one, three or four biers were brought up by the porters in
               rear of them, so that, whereas the priests supposed that they had
               but one corpse to bury, they discovered that there were six or
               eight, or sometimes more. Nor, for all their number, were their
               obsequies honoured by either tears or lights or crowds of mourners;
               rather, it was come to this, that a dead man was then of no more
               account than a dead goat would be to-day. From all which it is
               abundantly manifest, that that lesson of patient resignation, which
               the sages were never able to learn from the slight and infrequent
               mishaps which occur in the natural course of events, was now brought
               home even to the minds of the simple by the magnitude of their
               disasters, so that they became indifferent to them.

            <p n="24">As consecrated ground there was not in extent sufficient to
               provide tombs for the vast multitude of corpses which day and night,
               and almost every hour, were brought in eager haste to the churches
               for interment, least of all, if ancient custom were to be observed and
               a separate resting-place assigned to each, they dug, for each graveyard,
               as soon as it was full, a huge trench, in which they laid the
               corpses as they arrived by hundreds at a time, piling them up as
               merchandise is stowed in the hold of a ship, tier upon tier, each
               covered with a little earth, until the trench would hold no more.
               But I spare to rehearse with minute particularity each of the woes
               that came upon our city, and say in brief, that, harsh as was the
               tenor of her fortunes, the surrounding country knew no mitigation;
               for there--not to speak of the castles, each, as it were, a little city in
               itself--in sequestered village, or on the open champaign, by the wayside,
               on the farm, in the homestead, the poor hapless husbandmen
               and their families, forlorn of physicians' care or servants' tendance,
               perished day and night alike, not as men, but rather as beasts.
               Wherefore, they too, like the citizens, abandoned all rule of life, all
               habit of industry, all counsel of prudence; nay, one and all, as if
               expecting each day to be their last, not merely ceased to aid Nature
               to yield her fruit in due season of their beasts and their lands and
               their past labours, but left no means unused, which ingenuity could
               devise, to waste their accumulated store; denying shelter to their
               oxen, asses, sheep, goats, pigs, fowls, nay, even to their dogs, man's
               most faithful companions, and driving them out into the fields to
               roam at large amid the unsheaved, nay, unreaped corn. Many of
               which, as if endowed with reason, took their fill during the day, and
               returned home at night without any guidance of herdsman. But
               enough of the country! What need we add, but (reverting to the
               city) that such and so grievous was the harshness of heaven, and
               perhaps in some degree of man, that, what with the fury of the
               pestilence, the panic of those whom it spared, and their consequent
               neglect or desertion of not a few of the stricken in their need, it is
               believed without any manner of doubt, that between March and the
               ensuing July upwards of a hundred thousand human beings lost their
               lives within the walls of the city of <span class="place">Florence</span>, which before the
               deadly visitation would not have been supposed to contain so many
               people! How many grand palaces, how many stately homes, how
               many splendid residences, once full of retainers, of lords, of ladies,
               were now left desolate of all, even to the meanest servant! How
               many families of historic fame, of vast ancestral domains, and wealth
               proverbial, found now no scion to continue the succession! How
               many brave men, how many fair ladies, how many gallant youths,
               whom any physician, were he Galen, Hippocrates, or Æsculapius
               himself, would have pronounced in the soundest of health, broke fast
               with their kinsfolk, comrades and friends in the morning, and when
               evening came, supped with their forefathers in the other world!
            </p>
            <p n="25">Irksome it is to myself to rehearse in detail so sorrowful a history.
               Wherefore, being minded to pass over so much thereof as I fairly
               can, I say, that our city, being thus well-nigh depopulated, it so
               happened, as I afterwards learned from one worthy of credit, that
               on a Tuesday morning after Divine Service the venerable church of
               <span class="place">Santa Maria Novella</span> was almost deserted save for the presence of
               seven young ladies habited sadly in keeping with the season. All
               were connected either by blood or at least as friends or neighbours;
               and fair and of good understanding were they all, as also of noble
               birth, gentle manners, and a modest sprightliness. In age none
               exceeded twenty-eight, or fell short of eighteen years. Their names
               I would set down in due form, had I not good reason to withhold
               them, being solicitous lest the matters which here ensue, as told
               and heard by them, should in after time be occasion of reproach to
               any of them, in view of the ample indulgence which was then, for the
               reasons heretofore set forth, accorded to the lighter hours of persons of
               much riper years than they, but which the manners of to-day have
               somewhat restricted; nor would I furnish material to detractors,
               ever ready to bestow their bite where praise is due, to cast by invidious
               speech the least slur upon the honour of these noble ladies. Wherefore,
               that what each says may be apprehended without confusion, I
               intend to give them names more or less appropriate to the character
               of each. The first, then, being the eldest of the seven, we will call
               <span class="person">Pampinea</span>, the second <span class="person">Fiammetta</span>, the third <span class="person">Filomena</span>, the fourth
               <span class="person">Emilia</span>, the fifth we will distinguish as <span class="person">Lauretta</span>, the sixth as <span class="person">Neifile</span>,
               and the last, not without reason, shall be named Elisa.
            </p>
            <p n="26">'Twas not of set purpose but by mere chance that these ladies met
               in the same part of the church; but at length grouping themselves
               into a sort of circle, after heaving a few sighs, they gave up saying
               paternosters, and began to converse (among other topics) on the
               times.
            </p>
            <p n="27">So they continued for a while, and then <span class="person">Pampinea</span>, the rest listening
               in silent attention, thus began: Dear ladies mine, often have I
               heard it said, and you doubtless as well as I, that wrong is done to
               none by whoso but honestly uses his reason. And to fortify, preserve,
               and defend his life to the utmost of his power is the dictate of natural
               reason in every one that is born. Which right is accorded in such
               measure that in defence thereof men have been held blameless in
               taking life. And if this be allowed by the laws, albeit on their
               stringency depends the well-being of every mortal, how much more
               exempt from censure should we, and all other honest folk, be in
               taking such means as we may for the preservation of our life? As
               often as I bethink me how we have been occupied this morning, and
               not this morning only, and what has been the tenor of our conversation,
               I perceive--and you will readily do the like--that each of
               us is apprehensive on her own account; nor thereat do I marvel, but
               at this I do marvel greatly, that, though none of us lacks a woman's
               wit, yet none of us has recourse to any means to avert that which
               we all justly fear. Here we tarry, as if, methinks, for no other
               purpose than to bear witness to the number of the corpses that are
               brought hither for interment, or to hearken if the brothers there
               within, whose number is now almost reduced to nought, chant their
               offices at the canonical hours, or, by our weeds of woe, to obtrude on
               the attention of every one that enters, the nature and degree of our
               sufferings. And if we quit the church, we see dead or sick folk carried
               about,
               or we see those, who for their crimes were of late condemned to
               exile by the outraged majesty of the public laws, but who now, in
               contempt of those laws, well knowing that their ministers are a prey
               to death or disease, have returned, and traverse the city in packs,
               making it hideous with their riotous antics; or else we see the refuse
               of the people, fostered on our blood, becchini, as they call themselves,
               who for our torment go prancing about here and there and everywhere,
               making mock of our miseries in scurrilous songs. Nor hear
               we aught but: Such and such are dead; or, Such and such are
               dying; and should hear dolorous wailing on every hand, were there
               but any to wail. Or go we home, what see we there? I know not
               if you are in like case with me; but there, where once were servants
               in plenty, I find none left but my maid, and shudder with terror, and
               feel the very hairs of my head to stand on end; and turn or tarry
               where I may, I encounter the ghosts of the departed, not with their
               wonted mien, but with something horrible in their aspect that appals
               me. For which reasons church and street and home are alike distressful
               to me, and the more so that none, methinks, having means and place
               of retirement as we have, abides here save only we; or if any such
               there be, they are of those, as my senses too often have borne witness,
               who make no distinction between things honourable and their
               opposites, so they but answer the cravings of appetite, and, alone or
               in company, do daily and nightly what things soever give promise of
               most gratification. Nor are these secular persons alone; but such as
               live recluse in monasteries break their rule, and give themselves up
               to carnal pleasures, persuading themselves that they are permissible
               to them, and only forbidden to others, and, thereby thinking to
               escape, are become unchaste and dissolute. If such be our circumstances--and
               such most manifestly they are--what do we here?
               what wait we for? what dream we of? why are we less prompt to
               provide for our own safety than the rest of the citizens? Is life less
               dear to us than to all other women? or think we that the bond
               which unites soul and body is stronger in us than in others, so that
               there is no blow that may light upon it, of which we need be
               apprehensive? If so, we err, we are deceived. What insensate folly
               were it in us so to believe! We have but to call to mind the
               number and condition of those, young as we, and of both sexes, who
               have succumbed to this cruel pestilence, to find therein conclusive
               evidence to the contrary. And lest from lethargy or indolence we
               fall into the vain imagination that by some lucky accident we may
               in some way or another, when we would, escape--I know not if
               your opinion accord with mine--I should deem it most wise in us,
               our case being what it is, if, as many others have done before us, and
               are still doing, we were to quit this place, and, shunning like death
               the evil example of others, betake ourselves to the country, and there
               live as honourable women on one of the estates, of which none of us
               has any lack, with all cheer of festal gathering and other delights, so
               long as in no particular we overstep the bounds of reason. There we
               shall hear the chant of birds, have sight of verdant hills and plains, of
               cornfields undulating like the sea, of trees of a thousand sorts; there
               also we shall have a larger view of the heavens, which, however harsh
               to usward, yet deny not their eternal beauty; things fairer far for
               epe to rest on than the desolate walls of our city. Moreover, we
               shall there breathe a fresher air, find ampler store of things meet for
               such as live in these times, have fewer causes of annoy. For, though
               the husbandmen die there, even as here the citizens, they are
               dispersed in scattered homesteads, and 'tis thus less painful to witness.
               Nor, so far as I can see, is there a soul here whom we shall desert;
               rather we may truly say, that we are ourselves deserted; for, our
               kinsfolk being either dead or fled in fear of death, no more regardful
               of us than if we were strangers, we are left alone in our great
               affliction. No censure, then, can fall on us if we do as I propose;
               and otherwise grievous suffering, perhaps death, may ensue. Wherefore,
               if you agree, 'tis my advice, that, attended by our maids with al???
               things needful, we sojourn, now on this, now on the other estate,
               and in such way of life continue, until we see--if death should not
               first overtake us--the end which Heaven reserves for these events.
               And I remind you that it will be at least as seemly in us to leave
               with honour, as in others, of whom there are not a few, to stay with
               dishonour.
            </p>
            <p n="28">The other ladies praised <span class="person">Pampinea</span>'s plan, and indeed were so
               prompt to follow it, that they had already begun to discuss the
               manner in some detail, as if they were forthwith to rise from their
               seats and take the road, when <span class="person">Filomena</span>, whose judgment was
               excellent, interposed, saying: Ladies, though <span class="person">Pampinea</span> has spoken
               to most excellent effect, yet it were not well to be so precipitate as
               you seem disposed to be. Bethink you that we are all women; nor
               is there any here so young, but she is of years to understand how
               women are minded towards one another, when they are alone
               together, and how ill they are able to rule themselves without the
               guidance of some man. We are sensitive, perverse, suspicious,
               pusillanimous and timid; wherefore I much misdoubt, that, if we
               find no other guidance than our own, this company is like to break
               up sooner, and with less credit to us, than it should. Against which
               it were well to provide at the outset. Said then Elisa: 
               Without
               doubt man is woman's head, and, without man's governance, it is
               seldom that aught that we do is brought to a commendable conclusion.
               But how are we to come by the men? Every one of us
               here knows that her kinsmen are for the most part dead, and that the
               survivors are dispersed, one here, one there, we know not where, bent
               each on escaping the same fate as ourselves; nor were it seemly to
               seek the aid of strangers; for, as we are in quest of health, we must
               find some means so to order matters that, wherever we seek diversion
               or repose, trouble and scandal do not follow us.
            </p>
            <p n="29">While the ladies were thus conversing, there came into the church
               three young men, young, I say, but not so young that the age of the
               youngest was less than twenty-five years; in whom neither the
               sinister course of events, nor the loss of friends or kinsfolk, nor fear
               for their own safety, had availed to quench, or even temper, the
               ardour of their love. The first was called Pamfilo, the second
               <span class="person">Filostrato</span>, and the third <span class="person">Dioneo</span>. Very debonair and chivalrous
               were they all; and in this troublous time they were seeking if haply,
               to their exceeding great solace, they might have sight of their fair
               friends, all three of whom chanced to be among the said seven ladies,
               besides some that were of kin to the young men. At one and the
               same moment they recognised the ladies and were recognised by
               them: wherefore, with a gracious smile, <span class="person">Pampinea</span> thus began:
               Lo, fortune is propitious to our enterprise, having vouchsafed us the
               good offices of these young men, who are as gallant as they are
               discreet, and will gladly give us their guidance and escort, so we but
               take them into our service. Whereupon <span class="person">Neifile</span>, crimson from brow
               to neck with the blush of modesty, being one of those that had a
               lover among the young men, said: For God's sake, <span class="person">Pampinea</span>,
               have a care what you say. Well assured am I that nought but good
               can be said of any of them, and I deem them fit for office far more
               onerous than this which you propose for them, and their good and
               honourable company worthy of ladies fairer by far and more tenderly
               to be cherished than such as we. But 'tis no secret that they love
               some of us here; wherefore I misdoubt that, if we take them with
               us, we may thereby give occasion for scandal and censure merited
               neither by us nor by them. That, said <span class="person">Filomena</span>, is of no
               consequence;
               so I but live honestly, my conscience gives me no
               disquietude; if others asperse me, God and the truth will take arms
               in my defence. Now, should they be disposed to attend us, of a truth
               we might say with <span class="person">Pampinea</span>, that fortune favours our enterprise.
               The silence which followed betokened consent on the part of the other
               ladies, who then with one accord resolved to call the young men, and
               acquaint them with their purpose, and pray them to be of their company.
               So without further parley <span class="person">Pampinea</span>, who had a kinsman
               among the young men, rose and approached them where they stood
               intently regarding them; and greeting them gaily, she opened to them
               their plan, and besought them on the part of herself and her friends
               to join their company on terms of honourable and fraternal comradeship.
               At first the young men thought she did but trifle with them;
               but when they saw that she was in earnest, they answered with
               alacrity that they were ready, and promptly, even before they left
               the church, set matters in train for their departure. So all things
               meet being first sent forward in due order to their intended place
               of sojourn, the ladies with some of their maids, and the three young
               men, each attended by a man-servant, sallied forth of the city on
               the morrow, being Wednesday, about daybreak, and took the road;
               nor had they journeyed more than two short miles when they
               arrived at their destination. The estateIdentified by tradition with
               the Villa Palmieri (now Crawford) on the
               slope of <span class="place">Fiesole</span>. lay upon a little hill some
               distance from the nearest highway, and, embowered in shrubberies
               of divers hues, and other greenery, afforded the eye a pleasant
               prospect. On the summit of the hill was a palace with galleries,
               halls and chambers, disposed around a fair and spacious court, each
               very fair in itself, and the goodlier to see for the gladsome pictures
               with which it was adorned; the whole set amidst meads and gardens
               laid out with marvellous art, wells of the coolest water, and vaults of
               the finest wines, things more suited to dainty drinkers than to sober
               and honourable women. On their arrival the company, to their no
               small delight, found their beds already made, the rooms well swept
               and garnished with flowers of every sort that the season could afford,
               and the floors carpeted with rushes. When they were seated,
               <span class="person">Dioneo</span>, a gallant who had not his match for courtesy and wit, spoke
               thus: My ladies, 'tis not our forethought so much as your own
               mother-wit that has guided us hither. How you mean to dispose
               of your cares I know not; mine I left behind me within the citygate
               when I issued thence with you a brief while ago. Wherefore,
               I pray you, either address yourselves to make merry, to laugh and
               sing with me (so far, I mean, as may consist with your dignity), or
               give me leave to hie me back to the stricken city, there to abide
               with my cares. To whom blithely <span class="person">Pampinea</span> replied, as if she too
               had cast off all her cares: Well sayest thou, <span class="person">Dioneo</span>, excellent
               well; gaily we mean to live; 'twas a refuge from sorrow that here
               we sought, nor had we other cause to come hither. But, as no
               anarchy can long endure, I who initiated the deliberations of which
               this fair company is the fruit, do now, to the end that our joy may
               be lasting, deem it expedient, that there be one among us in chief
               authority, honoured and obeyed by us as our superior, whose
               exclusive care it shall be to devise how we may pass our time
               blithely. And that each in turn may prove the weight of the care,
               as well as enjoy the pleasure, of sovereignty, and, no distinction being
               made of sex, envy be felt by none by reason of exclusion from the
               office; I propose, that the weight and honour be borne by each one
               for a day; and let the first to bear sway be chosen by us all,
               those that follow to be appointed towards the vesper hour by him
               or her who shall have had the signory for that day; and let each
               holder of the signory be, for the time, sole arbiter of the place and
               manner in which we are to pass our time.
            </p>
            <p n="30"><span class="person">Pampinea</span>'s speech was received with the utmost applause, and
               with one accord she was chosen queen for the first day. Whereupon
               <span class="person">Filomena</span> hied her lightly to a bay-tree, having often heard of the
               great honour in which its leaves, and such as were deservedly
               crowned therewith, were worthy to be holden; and having gathered
               a few sprays, she made thereof a goodly wreath of honour, and set
               it on <span class="person">Pampinea</span>'s head; which wreath was thenceforth, while
               their company endured, the visible sign of the wearer's sway and
               sovereignty.

            <p n="31">No sooner was Queen <span class="person">Pampinea</span> crowned than she bade all be
               silent. She then caused summon to her presence their four maids,
               and the servants of the three young men, and, all keeping silence,
               said to them: That I may shew you all at once, how,
               well still giving place to better, our company may flourish and
               endure, as long as it shall pleasure us, with order meet and assured

               <span class="person">Parmeno</span>, my seneschal, and entrust him with the care and control
               of all our household, and all that belongs to the service of the hall.
               Pamfilo's man, <span class="person">Sirisco</span>, I appoint treasurer and chancellor of our
               exchequer; and be he ever answerable to <span class="person">Parmeno</span>. While <span class="person">Parmeno</span>
               and <span class="person">Sirisco</span> are too busy about their duties to serve their masters,
               let <span class="person">Filostrato</span>'s man, <span class="person">Tindaro</span>, have charge of the chambers of all
               three. My maid, <span class="person">Misia</span>, and <span class="person">Filomena</span>'s maid, <span class="person">Licisca</span>, will keep in
               the kitchen, and with all due diligence prepare such dishes as
               <span class="person">Parmeno</span> shall bid them. <span class="person">Lauretta</span>'s maid, <span class="person">Chimera</span>, and <span class="person">Fiammetta</span>'s
               maid, <span class="person">Stratilia</span> we make answerable for the ladies' chambers, and
               wherever we may take up our quarters, let them see that all is
               spotless. And now we enjoin you, one and all alike, as you value
               our favour, that none of you, go where you may, return whence
               you may, hear or see what you may, bring us any tidings but such as
               be cheerful. These orders thus succinctly given were received with
               universal approval. Whereupon <span class="person">Pampinea</span> rose, and said gaily:
               Here are gardens, meads, and other places delightsome enough,
               where you may wander at will, and take your pleasure; but on the

            <p n="32">Thus dismissed by their new queen the gay company sauntered
               gently through a garden, the young men saying sweet things to the
               fair ladies, who wove fair garlands of divers sorts of leaves and sang
               love-songs.
            </p>
            <p n="33">Having thus spent the time allowed them by the queen, they
               returned to the house, where they found that <span class="person">Parmeno</span> had entered
               on his office with zeal; for in a hall on the ground-floor they saw
               tables covered with the whitest of cloths, and beakers that shone
               like silver, and sprays of broom scattered everywhere. So, at the bidding
               of the queen, they washed their hands, and all took their places
               as marshalled by <span class="person">Parmeno</span>. Dishes, daintily prepared, were served,
               and the finest wines were at hand; the three serving-men did their
               office noiselessly; in a word all was fair and ordered in a seemly
               manner; whereby the spirits of the company rose, and they
               seasoned their viands with pleasant jests and sprightly sallies.
               Breakfast done, the tables were removed, and the queen bade fetch
               instruments of music; for all, ladies and young men alike, knew
               how to tread a measure, and some of them played and sang with
               great skill: so, at her command, <span class="person">Dioneo</span> having taken a lute, and
               <span class="person">Fiammetta</span> a viol, they struck up a dance in sweet concert; and,
               the servants being dismissed to their repast, the queen, attended by
               the other ladies and the two young men, led off a stately carol; which
               ended they fell to singing ditties dainty and gay. Thus they diverted
               themselves until the queen, deeming it time to retire to rest, dismissed
               them all for the night. So the three young men and the
               ladies withdrew to their several quarters, which were in different
               parts of the palace. There they found the beds well made, and
               abundance of flowers, as in the hall; and so they undressed, and
               went to bed.
            </p>
            <p n="34">Shortly after noneThe canonical hour following sext, i. e. 3
               p.m. the queen rose, and roused the rest of the
               ladies, as also the young men, averring that it was injurious to the
               health to sleep long in the daytime. They therefore hied them to
               a meadow, where the grass grew green and luxuriant, being nowhere
               scorched by the sun, and a light breeze gently fanned them. So at
               the queen's command they all ranged themselves in a circle on the
               grass, and hearkened while she thus spoke:
            </p>
            <p n="35">You mark that the sun is high, the heat intense, and the silence
               unbroken save by the cicalas among the olive-trees. It were therefore
               the height of folly to quit this spot at present. Here the air
               is cool and the prospect fair, and here, observe, are dice and chess.
               Take, then, your pleasure as you may be severally minded; but, if
               you take my advice, you will find pastime for the hot hours before
               us, not in play, in which the loser must needs be vexed, and
               neither the winner nor the onlooker much the better pleased, but
               in telling of stories, in which the invention of one may afford
               solace to all the company of his hearers. You will not each have
               told a story before the sun will be low, and the heat abated, so that
               we shall be able to go and severally take our pleasure where it may
               seem best to each. Wherefore, if my proposal meet with your
               approval--for in this I am disposed to consult your pleasure--let us
               adopt it; if not, divert yourselves as best you may, until the vesper
               hour.
            </p>
            <p n="36">The queen's proposal being approved by all, ladies and men alike,
               she added: So please you, then, I ordain, that, for this first day,
               we be free to discourse of such matters as most commend themselves
               to each in turn. She then addressed Pamfilo, who sat on her
               right hand, bidding him with a gracious air to lead off with one of
               his stories. And prompt at the word of command, Pamfilo, while
               all listened intently, thus began:

                  <p n="38">A seemly thing it is, dearest ladies, that whatever we do, it be
                     begun
                     in the holy and awful name of Him who was the maker of all. Wherefore,
                     as it falls to me to lead the way in this your enterprise of storytelling,
                     I intend to begin with one of His wondrous works, that, by
                     hearing thereof, our hopes in Him, in whom is no change, may be
                     established, and His name be by us forever lauded. 'Tis manifest
                     that, as things temporal are all doomed to pass and perish, so within
                     and without they abound with trouble and anguish and travail, and
                     are subject to infinite perils; nor, save for the especial grace of God,
                     should we, whose being is bound up with and forms part of theirs,
                     have either the strength to endure or the wisdom to combat their
                     adverse influences. By which grace we are visited and penetrated
                     (so we must believe) not by reason of any merit of our own, but
                     solely out of the fulness of God's own goodness, and in answer to the
                     prayers of those who, being mortal like ourselves, did faithfully
                     observe His ordinances during their lives, and are now become
                     blessed for ever with Him in heaven. To whom, as to advocates
                     taught by experience all that belongs to our frailty, we, not daring,
                     perchance, to present our petitions in the presence of so great a Judge,
                     make known our requests for such things as we deem expedient for
                     us. And of His mercy richly abounding to usward we have further
                     proof herein, that, no keenness of mortal vision being able in any
                     degree to penetrate the secret counsels of the Divine mind, it
                     sometimes,
                     perchance, happens, that, in error of judgment, we make one
                     our advocate before His Majesty, who is banished from His presence
                     in eternal exile, and yet He to whom nothing is hidden, having
                     regard rather to the sincerity of our prayers than to our ignorance or
                     the banishment of the intercessor, hears us no less than if the intercessor
                     were in truth one of the blest who enjoy the light of His
                     countenance. Which the story that I am about to relate may serve
                     to make apparent; apparent, I mean, according to the standard of

               wealthy merchant, being made a knight in <span class="place">France</span>, and being to
               attend Charles Sansterre, brother of the King of <span class="place">France</span>, when he
               came into <span class="place">Tuscany</span> at the instance and with the support of Pope
               Boniface, found his affairs, as often happens to merchants, to be
               much involved in divers quarters, and neither easily nor suddenly to
               be adjusted; wherefore he determined to place them in the hands of
               commissioners, and found no difficulty except as to certain credits
               given to some Burgundians, for the recovery of which he doubted
               whether he could come by a competent agent; for well he knew
               that the Burgundians were violent men and ill-conditioned and
               faithless; nor could he call to mind any man so bad that he could
               with confidence oppose his guile to theirs. After long pondering
               the matter, he recollected one Ser Ciapperello da <span class="place">Prato</span>, who much
               frequented his house in <span class="place">Paris</span>. Who being short of stature and very
               affected, the French who knew not the meaning of Cepparello,The
               	diminutive of ceppo, stump or log: more commonly written
               	cepperello (cf. p. 32) or ceppatello. The form ciapperello
               	seems to be found only here. 
               but supposed that it meant the same as Cappello, i. e. garland, in their
               vernacular, called him not Cappello, but Ciappelletto by reason of his
               diminutive size; and as Ciappelletto he was known everywhere,
               whereas few people knew him as Ciapperello. Now Ciappelletto's
               manner of life was thus. He was by profession a notary, and his
               pride was to make false documents; he would have made them as
               often as he was asked, and more readily without fee than another
               at a great price; few indeed he made that were not false, and great
               was his shame when they were discovered. False witness he bore,
               solicited or unsolicited, with boundless delight; and, as oaths were in
               those days had in very great respect in <span class="place">France</span>, he, scrupling not to
               forswear himself, corruptly carried the day in every case in which he
               was summoned faithfully to attest the truth. He took inordinate
               delight, and bestirred himself with great zeal, in fomenting ill-feeling,
               enmities, dissensions between friends, kinsfolk and all other folk;
               and the more calamitous were the consequences the better he was
               pleased. Set him on murder, or any other foul crime, and he never
               hesitated, but went about it with alacrity; he had been known on
               more than one occasion to inflict wounds or death by preference
               with his own hands. He was a profuse blasphemer of God and His
               saints, and that on the most trifling occasions, being of all men the
               most irascible. He was never seen at church, held all the sacraments
               vile things, and derided them in language of horrible ribaldry.
               On the other hand he resorted readily to the tavern and other
               places of evil repute, and frequented them. He was as fond of
               women as a dog is of the stick: in the use against nature he had
               not his match among the most abandoned. He would have pilfered
               and stolen as a matter of conscience, as a holy man would make an
               oblation. Most gluttonous he was and inordinately fond of his
               cups, whereby he sometimes brought upon himself both shame and
               suffering. He was also a practised gamester and thrower of false
               dice. But why enlarge so much upon him? Enough that he was,
               perhaps, the worst man that ever was born.

            <p n="40">The rank and power of Musciatto Franzesi had long been this
               reprobate's mainstay, serving in many instances to secure him considerate
               treatment on the part of the private persons whom he
               frequently, and the court which he unremittingly, outraged. So
               Musciatto, having bethought him of this Ser Cepparello, with whose
               way of life he was very well acquainted, judged him to be the very
               sort of person to cope with the guile of the Burgundians. He therefore
               sent for him, and thus addressed him: Ser Ciappelletto, I am,
               as thou knowest, about to leave this place for good; and among
               those with whom I have to settle accounts are certain Burgundians,
               very wily knaves; nor know I the man whom I could more fitly
               entrust with the recovery of my money than thyself. Wherefore, as
               thou hast nothing to do at present, if thou wilt undertake this
               business, I will procure thee the favour of the court, and give thee a
               reasonable part of what thou shalt recover. Ser Ciappelletto, being
               out of employment, and by no means in easy circumstances, and
               about to lose Musciatto, so long his mainstay and support, without
               the least demur, for in truth he had hardly any choice, made his
               mind up and answered that he was ready to go. So the bargain was
               struck. Armed with the power of attorney and the royal letters
               commendatory, Ser Ciappelletto took leave of Messer Musciatto and
               hied him to <span class="place">Burgundy</span>, where he was hardly known to a soul. He
               set about the business which had brought him thither, the recovery
               of the money, in a manner amicable and considerate, foreign to his
               nature, as if he were minded to reserve his severity to the last.
               While thus occupied, he was frequently at the house of two
               Florentine usurers, who treated him with great distinction out of
               regard for Messer Musciatto; and there it so happened that he fell
               sick. The two brothers forthwith placed physicians and servants in
               attendance upon him, and omitted no means meet and apt for the
               restoration of his health. But all remedies proved unavailing; for
               being now old, and having led, as the physicians reported, a disorderly
               life, he went daily from bad to worse like one stricken with a
               mortal disease. This greatly disconcerted the two brothers; and one
               day, hard by the room in which Ser Ciappelletto lay sick, they began
               to talk about him; saying one to the other: What shall we do
               with this man? We are hard bested indeed on his account. If we
               turn him out of the house, sick as he is, we shall not only incur grave
               censure, but shall evince a signal want of sense; for folk must know
               the welcome we gave him in the first instance, the solicitude with
               which we have had him treated and tended since his illness, during
               which time he could not possibly do aught to displease us, and yet
               they would see him suddenly turned out of our house sick unto
               death. On the other hand he has been so bad a man that he is sure
               not to confess or receive any of the Church's sacraments; and dying
               thus unconfessed, he will be denied burial in church, but will be cast out
               into some ditch like a dog; nay, 'twill be all one if he do confess, for
               such and so horrible have been his crimes that no friar or priest either
               will or can absolve him; and so, dying without absolution, he will
               still be cast out into the ditch. In which case the folk of these parts,
               who reprobate our trade as iniquitous and revile it all day long, and
               would fain rob us, will seize their opportunity, and raise a tumult,
               and make a raid upon our houses, crying: 'A way with these Lombard
               dogs, whom the Church excludes from her pale;' and will certainly
               strip us of our goods, and perhaps take our lives also; so that in any
               case we stand to lose if this man die.
            </p>
            <p n="41">Ser Ciappelletto, who, as we said, lay close at hand while they
               	thus spoke, and whose hearing was sharpened, as is often the case,
               	by his malady, overheard all that they said about him. So he called
               	them to him, and said to them: I would not have you disquiet
               	  yourselves in regard of me, or apprehend loss to befall you by my
               	  death. I have heard what you have said of me and have no doubt
               	  that 'twould be as you say, if matters took the course you anticipate;
               	  but I am minded that it shall be otherwise. I have committed so
               	  many offences against God in the course of my life, that one more in
               	  the hour of my death will make no difference whatever to the account.
               	  So seek out and bring hither the worthiest and most holy friar you
               	  can find, and leave me to settle your affairs and mine upon a sound
               	  and solid basis, with which you may rest satisfied. The two brothers
               	had not much hope of the result, but yet they went to a friary and
               	asked for a holy and discreet man to hear the confession of a Lombard
               	that was sick in their house, and returned with an aged man of just
               	and holy life, very learned in the Scriptures, and venerable and held
               	in very great and especial reverence by all the citizens. As soon as
               	he had entered the room where Ser Ciappelletto was lying, and had
               	taken his place by his side, he began gently to comfort him: then he
               	asked him how long it was since he was confessed. Whereto Ser
               	Ciappelletto, who had never been confessed, answered: Father, it
               	  is my constant practice to be confessed at least once a week, and
               	  many a week I am confessed more often; but true it is, that, since I
               	  have been sick, now eight days, I have made no confession, so sore
               	  has been my affliction. Son, said the friar, thou hast well
               	  done,
               	  and well for thee, if so thou continue to do; as thou dost confess
               	  so often, I see that my labour of hearkening and questioning will be
               	  slight. Nay but, master friar, said Ser Ciappelletto, say not
               	  so; I have not confessed so often but that I would fain make a
               	  general confession of all my sins that I have committed, so far as
               	  I can recall them, from the day of my birth to the present time;
               	  and therefore I pray you, my good father, to question me precisely in
               	  every particular just as if I had never been confessed. And spare me
               	  not by reason of my sickness, for I had far rather do despite to my
               	  flesh than, sparing it, risk the perdition of my soul, which my Saviour
               	  redeemed with His precious blood.
            </p>
            <p n="42">The holy man was mightily delighted with these words, which
               	seemed to him to betoken a soul in a state of grace. He therefore
               	signified to Ser Ciappelletto his high approval of this practice; and
               	then began by asking him whether he had ever sinned carnally with
               	a woman. Whereto Ser Ciappelletto answered with a sigh: My
               	  father, I scruple to tell you the truth in this matter, fearing lest I sin
               	  in vain-glory. Nay, but, said the friar, speak boldly; none
               	  ever sinned by telling the truth, either in confession or otherwise.
               	Then, said Ser Ciappelletto, as you bid me speak boldly, I will
               	  tell you the truth of this matter. I am virgin even as when I issued
               	  from my mother's womb. Now God's blessing on thee, said the
               	friar, well done; and the greater is thy merit in that, hadst thou
               	  so willed, thou mightest have done otherwise far more readily than
               	  we who are under constraint of rule. He then proceeded to ask,
               	whether he had offended God by gluttony. Whereto Ser Ciappelletto,
               	heaving a heavy sigh, answered that he had frequently so offended;
               	for, being wont to fast not only in Lent like other devout persons, but
               	at least three days in every week, taking nothing but bread and water,
               	he had quaffed the water with as good a gusto and as much enjoyment,
               	more particularly when fatigued by devotion or pilgrimage, as great
               	drinkers quaff their wine; and oftentimes he had felt a craving for
               	such dainty dishes of herbs as ladies make when they go into the
               	country, and now and again he had relished his food more than
               	seemed to him meet in one who fasted, as he did, for devotion.
               	Son, said the friar, these sins are natural and very trifling; and
               	  therefore I would not have thee burden thy conscience too much
               	  with them. There is no man, however holy he may be, but must
               	  sometimes find it pleasant to eat after a long fast and to drink after
               	  exertion. O, my father, said Ser Ciappelletto, say not this to
               	  comfort me. You know well that I know, that the things which are
               	  done in the service of God ought to be done in perfect purity of
               	  an unsullied spirit; and whoever does otherwise sins. 
               	The friar,
               	well content, replied: Glad I am that thou dost think so, and I
               	  am mightily pleased with thy pure and good conscience which therein
               	  appears; but tell me: hast thou sinned by avarice, coveting more
               	  than was reasonable, or withholding more than was right? My
               	  father, replied Ser Ciappelletto, I would not have you disquiet
               	  yourself, because I am in the house of these usurers: no part have
               	  I in their concerns; nay, I did but come here to admonish and
               	  reprehend them, and wean them from this abominable traffic; and
               	  so, I believe, I had done, had not God sent me this visitation. But
               	  you must know, that my father left me a fortune, of which I dedicated
               	  the greater part to God; and since then for my own support and the
               	  relief of Christ's poor I have done a little trading, whereof I have desired
               	  to make gain; and all that I have gotten I have shared with God's
               	  poor, reserving one half for my own needs and giving the other half
               	  to them; and so well has my Maker prospered me, that I have ever
               	  managed my affairs to better and better account. Well done,
               	said the friar; but how? hast thou often given way to anger?
               	Often indeed, I assure you, said Ser Ciappelletto. And who
               	  could refrain therefrom, seeing men doing frowardly all day long,
               	  breaking the commandments of God and recking nought of His
               	  judgments? Many a time in the course of a single day I had rather
               	  be dead than alive, to see the young men going after vanity, swearing
               	  and forswearing themselves, haunting taverns, avoiding the churches,
               	  and in short walking in the way of the world rather than in God's
               	  way. My son, said the friar, this is a righteous wrath; nor
               	  could I find occasion therein to lay a penance upon thee. But did
               	  anger ever by any chance betray thee into taking human life, or
               	  affronting or otherwise wronging any? Alas, replied Ser
               	Ciappelletto, alas, sir, man of God though you seem to me, how
               	  come you to speak after this manner? If I had had so much
               	  as the least thought of doing any of the things of which you speak,
               	  should I believe, think you, that I had been thus supported or
               	  God? These are the deeds of robbers and such like evil men, to
               	  whom I have ever said, when any I saw: 'Go, God change your
               	  heart.' Said then the friar: Now, my son, as thou hopest to
               	  be blest of God, tell me, hast thou never borne false witness against
               	  any, or spoken evil of another, or taken the goods of another without
               	  his leave? Yes, master friar, answered Ser Ciappelletto, most
               	  true it is that I have spoken evil of another; for I had once a neighbour
               	  who without the least excuse in the world was ever beating his
               	  wife, and so great was my pity of the poor creature, whom, when he
               	  was in his cups, he would thrash as God alone knows how, that once I
               	  spoke evil of him to his wife's kinsfolk. 
               	Well, well, said the
               	friar, thou tellest me thou hast been a merchant; hast thou ever
               	  cheated any, as merchants use to do? 
               	I'faith, yes, master friar,
               	said Ser Ciappelletto; but I know not who he was; only that he
               	  brought me some money which he owed me for some cloth that
               	  I had sold him, and I put it in a box without counting it, where
               	  a month afterwards I found four farthings more than there should
               	  have been, which I kept for a year to return to him, but not seeing
               	  him again, I bestowed them in alms for the love of God. This,
               	said the friar, was a small matter; and thou didst well to bestow
               	  them as thou didst. 
               	The holy friar went on to ask him many
               	other questions, to which he made answer in each case in this sort.
               	Then, as the friar was about to give him absolution, Ser Ciappelletto
               	interposed: Sir, I have yet a sin to confess. What? asked the
               	friar. I remember, he said, that I once caused my servant to
               	  sweep my house on a Saturday after none; and that my observance
               	  of Sunday was less devout than it should have been. 
               	O, my son,
               	said the friar, this is a light matter. 
               	No, said Ser Ciappelletto,
               	say not a light matter; for Sunday is the more to be had in honour
               	  because on that day our Lord rose from the dead. 
               	Then said the
               	holy friar: Now is there aught else that thou hast done?
               	Yes, master friar, replied Ser Ciappelletto, once by inadvertence
               	  I spat in the church of God. 
               	At this the friar began to smile, and
               	said: My son, this is not a matter to trouble about; we, who are
               	  religious, spit there all day long. 
               	And great impiety it is when
               	  you so do, replied Ser Ciappelletto, for there is nothing that
               	  is so worthy to be kept from all impurity as the holy temple in which
               	  sacrifice is offered to God. 
               	More he said in the same strain, which I
               	pass over; and then at last he began to sigh, and by and by to weep
               	bitterly, as he was well able to do when he chose. 
               	And the friar demanding: 
               	My son, why weepest thou? 
               	Alas, master friar, 
               	answered Ser Ciappelletto, a sin yet remains, which I have
               	  never confessed, such shame were it to me to tell it; and as often as
               	  I call it to mind, I weep as you now see me weep, being well assured
               	  that God will never forgive me this sin. 
               	Then said the holy friar:
               	Come, come, son, what is this that thou sayst? If all the sins of
               	  all the men, that ever were or ever shall be, as long as the world shall
               	  endure, were concentrated in one man, so great is the goodness of
               	  God that He would freely pardon them all, were he but penitent and
               	  contrite as I see thou art, and confessed them: wherefore tell me thy
               	  sin with a good courage. 
               	Then said Ser Ciappelletto, still weeping
               	bitterly: Alas, my father, mine is too great a sin, and scarce can
               	  I believe, if your prayers do not co-operate, that God will ever grant
               	  me His pardon thereof. 
               	Tell it with a good courage, said the
               	friar; I promise thee to pray God for thee. 
               	Ser Ciappelletto,
               	however, continued to weep, and would not speak, for all the friar's
               	encouragement. When he had kept him for a good while in suspense,
               	he heaved a mighty sigh, and said: My father, as you promise me
               	  to pray God for me, I will tell it you. Know, then, that once, when I
               	  was a little child, I cursed my mother; and having so said he began
               	again to weep bitterly. 
               	O, my son, said the friar, does this seem
               	  to thee so great a sin? Men curse God all day long, and He pardons
               	  them freely, if they repent them of having so done; and thinkest
               	  thou He will not pardon thee this? Weep not, be comforted, for
               	  truly, hadst thou been one of them that set Him on the Cross, with
               	  the contrition that I see in thee, thou wouldst not fail of His pardon.
               	Alas! my father, rejoined Ser Ciappelletto, what is this you
               	  say? To curse my sweet mother that carried me in her womb
               	  for nine months day and night, and afterwards on her shoulder
               	  more than a hundred times! Heinous indeed was my offence;
               	  'tis too great a sin; nor will it be pardoned, unless you pray God
               	  for me.
            </p>
            <p n="43">The friar now perceiving that Ser Ciappelletto had nothing more
               	to say, gave him absolution and his blessing, reputing him for a most
               	holy man, fully believing that all that he had said was true. And
               	who would not have so believed, hearing him so speak at the point
               	of death? 
               	Then, when all was done, he said: Ser Ciappelletto,
               	  if God so will, you will soon be well; but should it so come to pass
               	  that God call your blessed soul to Himself in this state of grace, is
               	  it well pleasing to you that your body be buried in our convent?
               	Yea, verily, master friar, replied Ser Ciappelletto; there would
               	  I be, and nowhere else, since you have promised to pray God for
               	  me; besides which I have ever had a special devotion to your order.
               	  Wherefore I pray you, that, on your return to your convent, you
               	  cause to be sent me that very Body of Christ, which you consecrate
               	  in the morning on the altar; because (unworthy though I be) I
               	  purpose with your leave to take it, and afterwards the holy and
               	  extreme unction, that, though I have lived as a sinner, I may die
               	  at any rate as a Christian. 
               	The holy man said that he was greatly
               	delighted, that it was well said of Ser Ciappelletto, and that
               	he would cause the Host to be forthwith brought to him; and
               	so it was.
            </p>
            <p n="44">The two brothers, who much misdoubted Ser Ciappelletto's power
               	to deceive the friar, had taken their stand on the other side of a
               	wooden partition which divided the room in which Ser Ciappelletto
               	lay from another, and hearkening there they readily heard and understood
               	what Ser Ciappelletto said to the friar; and at times could
               	scarce refrain their laughter as they followed his confession; and
               	now and again they said one to another: 
               	What manner of man
               	  is this, whom neither age nor sickness, nor fear of death, on the
               	  threshold of which he now stands, nor yet of God, before whose
               	  judgment-seat he must soon appear, has been able to turn from his
               	  wicked ways, that he die not even as he has lived? 
               	But seeing that
               	his confession had secured the interment of his body in church, they
               	troubled themselves no further. 
               	Ser Ciappelletto soon afterwards
               	communicated, and growing immensely worse, received the extreme
               	unction, and died shortly after vespers on the same day on which he
               	had made his good confession. 
               	So the two brothers, having from
               	his own moneys provided the wherewith to procure him honourable
               	sepulture, and sent word to the friars to come at even to observe the
               	usual vigil, and in the morning to fetch the corpse, set all things
               	in order accordingly. 
               	The holy friar who had confessed him, hearing
               	that he was dead, had audience of the prior of the friary; a chapter
               	was convened and the assembled brothers heard from the confessor's
               	own mouth how Ser Ciappelletto had been a holy man, as had
               	appeared by his confession, and were exhorted to receive the body
               	with the utmost veneration and pious care, as one by which there
               	was good hope that God would work many miracles. 
               	To this the
               	prior and the rest of the credulous confraternity assenting, they went
               	in a body in the evening to the place where the corpse of Ser
               	Ciappelletto lay, and kept a great and solemn vigil over it; and in
               	the morning they made a procession habited in their surplices and
               	copes, with books in their hands and crosses in front; and chanting
               	as they went, they fetched the corpse and brought it back to their
               	church with the utmost pomp and solemnity, being followed by
               	almost all the folk of the city, men and women alike. 
               	So it was laid
               	in the church, and then the holy friar who had heard the confession
               	got up in the pulpit and began to preach marvellous things of Ser
               	Ciappelletto's life, his fasts, his virginity, his simplicity and
               	guilelessness and holiness; narrating among other matters that of which
               	Ser Ciappelletto had made tearful confession as his greatest sin, and
               	how he had hardly been able to make him conceive that God would
               	pardon him; from which he took occasion to reprove his hearers;
               	saying: And you, accursed of God, on the least pretext, blaspheme
               	  God and His Mother, and all the celestial court. 
               	And much
               	beside he told of his loyalty and purity; and, in short, so wrought
               	upon the people by his words, to which they gave entire credence,
               	that they all conceived a great veneration for Ser Ciappelletto, and
               	at the close of the office came pressing forward with the utmost
               	vehemence to kiss the feet and the hands of the corpse, from which
               	they tore off the cerements, each thinking himself blessed to have
               	but a scrap thereof in his possession; and so it was arranged that
               	it should be kept there all day long, so as to be visible and accessible
               	to all. 
               	At nightfall it was honourably interred in a marble tomb
               	in one of the chapels, where on the morrow, one by one, folk came
               	and lit tapers and prayed and paid their vows, setting there the
               	waxen images which they had dedicated. And the fame of Ciappelletto's
               	holiness and the devotion to him grew in such measure that
               	scarce any there was that in any adversity would vow aught to any
               	saint but he, and they called him and still call him San Ciappelletto,
               	affirming that many miracles have been and daily are wrought by
               	God through him for such as devoutly crave his intercession.

               </div></em><p n="50">In <span class="place">Paris</span>, gracious ladies, as I have heard tell, there was once
               a great merchant, a large dealer in drapery, a good man, most loyal
               and righteous, his name Jehannot de Chevigny, between whom and
               a Jew, Abraham by name, also a merchant, and a man of great
               wealth, as also most loyal and righteous, there subsisted a very close
               friendship. Now Jehannot, observing Abraham's loyalty and rectitude,
               began to be sorely vexed in spirit that the soul of one so
               worthy and wise and good should perish for want of faith. 
               Wherefore
               he began in a friendly manner to plead with him, that he should
               leave the errors of the Jewish faith and turn to the Christian verity,
               which, being sound and holy, he might see daily prospering and
               gaining ground, whereas, on the contrary, his own religion was
               dwindling and was almost come to nothing. The Jew replied that
               he believed that there was no faith sound and holy except the Jewish
               faith, in which he was born, and in which he meant to live and die;
               nor would anything ever turn him therefrom. Nothing daunted,
               however, Jehannot some days afterwards began again to ply Abraham
               with similar arguments, explaining to him in such crude fashion as
               merchants use the reasons why our faith is better than the Jewish.
               And though the Jew was a great master in the Jewish law, yet,
               whether it was by reason of his friendship for Jehannot, or that the
               Holy Spirit dictated the words that the simple merchant used, at any
               rate the Jew began to be much interested in Jehannot's arguments,
               though still too staunch in his faith to suffer himself to be converted.
               But Jehannot was no less assiduous in plying him with argument
               than he was obstinate in adhering to his law, insomuch that at length
               the Jew, overcome by such incessant appeals, said: Well, well,
               Jehannot, thou wouldst have me become a Christian, and I am
               disposed to do so, provided I first go to <span class="place">Rome</span> and there see him
               whom thou callest God's vicar on earth, and observe what manner
               of life he leads and his brother cardinals with him; and if such it
               be that thereby, in conjunction with thy words, I may understand
               that thy faith is better than mine, as thou hast sought to shew me,
               I will do as I have said: otherwise, I will remain as I am a Jew.
               When Jehannot heard this, he was greatly distressed, saying to himself:
               I thought to have converted him; but now I see that the
               pains which I took for so excellent a purpose are all in vain; for, if he
               goes to the court of <span class="place">Rome</span> and sees the iniquitous and foul life which
               the clergy lead there, so far from turning Christian, had he been
               converted already, he would without doubt relapse into Judaism.
               Then turning to Abraham he said: Nay, but, my friend, why
               wouldst thou be at all this labour and great expense of travelling
               from here to <span class="place">Rome</span>? to say nothing of the risks both by sea and by
               land which a rich man like thee must needs run. Thinkest thou
               not to find here one that can give thee baptism? And as for any
               doubts that thou mayst have touching the faith to which I point thee,
               where wilt thou find greater masters and sages therein than here, to
               resolve thee of any question thou mayst put to them? Wherefore
               in my opinion this journey of thine is superfluous. Think that the
               prelates there are such as thou mayst have seen here, nay, as much
               better as they are nearer to the Chief Pastor. And so, by my advice
               thou wilt spare thy pains until some time of indulgence, when I,
               perhaps, may be able to bear thee company. The Jew replied:
               Jehannot, I doubt not that so it is as thou sayst; but once and
               for all I tell thee that I am minded to go there, and will never otherwise
               do that which thou wouldst have me and hast so earnestly
               besought me to do. Go then, said Jehannot, seeing that his
               mind was made up, and good luck go with thee; and so he gave
               up the contest because nothing would be lost, though he felt sure
               that he would never become a Christian after seeing the court of
               <span class="place">Rome</span>. The Jew took horse, and posted with all possible speed
               to <span class="place">Rome</span>; where on his arrival he was honourably received by his
               fellow Jews. He said nothing to any one of the purpose for which
               he had come; but began circumspectly to acquaint himself with the
               ways of the Pope and the cardinals and the other prelates and all the
               courtiers; and from what he saw for himself, being a man of great
               intelligence, or learned from others, he discovered that without
               distinction of rank they were all sunk in the most disgraceful lewdness,
               sinning not only in the way of nature but after the manner
               of the men of Sodom, without any restraint of remorse or shame, in
               such sort that, when any great favour was to be procured, the influence
               of the courtesans and boys was of no small moment. Moreover he
               found them one and all gluttonous, wine-bibbers, drunkards, and next
               after lewdness, most addicted to the shameless service of the belly,
               like brute beasts. And, as he probed the matter still further, he
               perceived that they were all so greedy and avaricious that human, nay
               Christian blood, and things sacred of what kind soever, spiritualities
               no less than temporalities, they bought and sold for money; which
               traffic was greater and employed more brokers than the drapery trade
               and all the other trades of <span class="place">Paris</span> put together; open simony and
               gluttonous excess being glosed under such specious terms as
               arrangement
               and moderate use of creature comforts, as if God could not
               penetrate the thoughts of even the most corrupt hearts, to say nothing
               of the signification of words, and would suffer Himself to be misled
               after the manner of men by the names of things. Which matters,
               with many others which are not to be mentioned, our modest and
               sober-minded Jew found by no means to his liking, so that, his
               curiosity being fully satisfied, he was minded to return to <span class="place">Paris</span>; which
               accordingly he did. There, on his arrival, he was met by Jehannot;
               and the two made great cheer together. Jehannot expected Abraham's
               conversion least of all things, and allowed him some days of rest before
               he asked what he thought of the Holy Father and the cardinals and
               the other courtiers. To which the Jew forthwith replied: I think
               God owes them all an evil recompense: I tell thee, so far as I was
               able to carry my investigations, holiness, devotion, good works or
               exemplary living in any kind was nowhere to be found in any clerk;
               but only lewdness, avarice, gluttony, and the like, and worse, if worse
               may be, appeared to be held in such honour of all, that (to my thinking)
               the place is a centre of diabolical rather than of divine activities.
               To the best of my judgment, your Pastor, and by consequence all
               that are about him devote all their zeal and ingenuity and subtlety
               to devise how best and most speedily they may bring the Christian
               religion to nought and banish it from the world. And because I see
               that what they so zealously endeavour does not come to pass, but
               that on the contrary your religion continually grows, and shines
               more and more clear, therein I seem to discern a very evident token
               that it, rather than any other, as being more true and holy than any
               other, has the Holy Spirit for its foundation and support. For which
               cause, whereas I met your exhortations in a harsh and obdurate
               temper, and would not become a Christian, now I frankly tell you
               that I would on no account omit to become such. Go we then to
               the church, and there according to the traditional rite of your holy
               faith let me receive baptism. Jehannot, who had anticipated a
               diametrically opposite conclusion, as soon as he heard him so speak,
               was the best pleased man that ever was in the world. So taking
               Abraham with him to <span class="place">Notre Dame</span> he prayed the clergy there to
               baptise him. When they heard that it was his own wish, they forthwith
               did so, and Jehannot raised him from the sacred font, and named
               him Jean; and afterwards he caused teachers of great eminence
               thoroughly to instruct him in our faith, which he readily learned,
               and afterwards practised in a good, a virtuous, nay, a holy life.

                     adventure; and as enough has been said of God and of the truth of
                     our faith, it will not now be inopportune if we descend to mundane
                     events and the actions of men. Wherefore I propose to tell you a
                     story, which will perhaps dispose you to be more circumspect than
                     you have been wont to be in answering questions addressed to you.
                     Well ye know, or should know, loving gossips, that, as it often
                     happens that folk by their own folly forfeit a happy estate and are
                     plunged in most grievous misery, so good sense will extricate the wise
                     from extremity of peril, and establish them in complete and assured
                     peace. Of the change from good to evil fortune, which folly may
                     effect, instances abound; indeed, occurring as they do by the thousand
                     day by day, they are so conspicuous that their recital would
                     be beside our present purpose. But that good sense may be our
                     succour in misfortune, I will now, as I promised, make plain to you
                     within the narrow compass of a little story.

               himself Soldan of <span class="place">Egypt</span>, and gained many victories over kings both
               Christian and Saracen, having in divers wars and by divers lavish
               displays of magnificence spent all his treasure, and in order to meet
               a certain emergency being in need of a large sum of money, and
               being at a loss to raise it with a celerity adequate to his necessity,
               bethought him of a wealthy Jew, <span class="person">Melchisedech</span> by name, who lent
               at usance in <span class="place">Alexandria</span>, and who, were he but willing, was, as he
               believed, able to accommodate him, but was so miserly that he would
               never do so of his own accord, nor was Saladin disposed to constrain him
               thereto. So great, however, was his necessity that, after pondering
               every method whereby the Jew might be induced to be compliant, at
               last he determined to devise a colourably reasonable pretext for extorting
               the money from him. So he sent for him, received him affably,
               seated him by his side, and presently said to him: My good man, I
               	have heard from many people that thou art very wise, and of great
               	discernment in divine things; wherefore I would gladly know of thee,
               	which of the three laws thou reputest the true law, the law of the
               	Jews, the law of the Saracens, or the law of the Christians? 
               The Jew,
               who was indeed a wise man, saw plainly enough that Saladin meant
               to entangle him in his speech, that he might have occasion to harass
               him, and bethought him that he could not praise any of the three laws
               above another without furnishing Saladin with the pretext which he
               sought. So, concentrating all the force of his mind to shape such an
               answer as might avoid the snare, he presently lit on what he sought,
               saying: 
               My lord, a pretty question indeed is this which you propound,
               	and fain would I answer it; to which end it is apposite that
               	I tell you a story, which, if you will hearken, is as follows:

                     <p n="54">If I
                        	mistake not, I remember to have often heard tell of a great and rich
                        	man of old time, who among other most precious jewels had in his
                        	treasury a ring of extraordinary beauty and value, which by reason
                        	of its value and beauty he was minded to leave to his heirs for ever;
                        	for which cause he ordained, that, whichever of his sons was found
                        	in possession of the ring as by his bequest, should thereby be designate
                        	his heir, and be entitled to receive from the rest the honour and
                        	homage due to a superior. The son, to whom he bequeathed the
                        	ring, left it in like manner to his descendants, making the like
                        	ordinance as his predecessor. In short the ring passed from hand to
                        	hand for many generations; and in the end came to the hands of
                        	one who had three sons, goodly and virtuous all, and very obedient
                        	to their father, so that he loved them all indifferently. The rule
                        	touching the descent of the ring was known to the young men, and
                        	each aspiring to hold the place of honour among them did all he
                        	could to persuade his father, who was now old, to leave the ring to
                        	him at his death. The worthy man, who loved them all equally, and
                        	knew not how to choose from among them a sole legatee, promised
                        	the ring to each in turn, and in order to satisfy all three, caused a
                        	cunning artificer secretly to make other two rings, so like the first,
                        	that the maker himself could hardly tell which was the true ring.
                        	So, before he died, he disposed of the rings, giving one privily to
                        	each of his sons; whereby it came to pass, that after his decease each
                        	of the sons claimed the inheritance and the place of honour, and, his
                        	claim being disputed by his brothers, produced his ring in witness of
                        	right. And the rings being found so like one to another that it
                        	was impossible to distinguish the true one, the suit to determine the
                        	true heir remained pendent, and still so remains. And so, my lord,
                        	to your question, touching the three laws given to the three peoples
                        	by God the Father, I answer: Each of these peoples deems itself to
                        	have the true inheritance, the true law, the true commandments of
                        	God; but which of them is justified in so believing, is a question
                        	which, like that of the rings, remains pendent.

               adroitness with which the Jew had contrived to evade the snare
               which he had laid for his feet was not lost upon Saladin. He therefore

               </div></em><p n="60">In the not very remote district of <span class="place">Lunigiana</span> there flourished
               formerly a community of monks more numerous and holy than is
               there to be found to-day, among whom was a young brother, whose
               vigour and lustihood neither the fasts nor the vigils availed to subdue.
                One afternoon, while the rest of the confraternity slept, our young
               monk took a stroll around the church, which lay in a very sequestered
               spot, and chanced to espy a young and very beautiful girl, a
               daughter, perhaps, of one of the husbandmen of those parts, going
               through the fields and gathering herbs as she went. No sooner had
               he seen her than he was sharply assailed by carnal concupiscence,
               insomuch that he made up to and accosted her; and (she hearkening)
               little by little they came to an understanding, and unobserved
               by any entered his cell together. Now it so chanced that, while
               they fooled it within somewhat recklessly, he being overwrought
               with passion, the abbot awoke and passing slowly by the young
               monk's cell, heard the noise which they made within, and the better
               to distinguish the voices, came softly up to the door of the cell, and
               listening discovered that beyond all doubt there was a woman within.
               His first thought was to force the door open; but, changing his
               mind, he returned to his chamber and waited until the monk should
               come out.
            </p>
            <p n="61">Delightsome beyond measure though the monk found his
               intercourse with the girl, yet was he not altogether without anxiety.
               He had heard, as he thought, the sound of footsteps in the dormitory,
               and having applied his eye to a convenient aperture had had a good
               view of the abbot as he stood by the door listening. He was thus
               fully aware that the abbot might have detected the presence of a
               woman in the cell. Whereat he was exceedingly distressed, knowing
               that he had a severe punishment to expect; but he concealed his
               vexation from the girl while he busily cast about in his mind for
               some way of escape from his embarrassment. He thus hit on a novel
               stratagem which was exactly suited to his purpose. With the air of
               one who had had enough of the girl's company he said to her: I
               shall now leave you in order that I may arrange for your departure
               hence unobserved. Stay here quietly until I return. 
               So out he
               went, locking the door of the cell, and withdrawing the key, which
               he carried straight to the abbot's chamber and handed to him, as was
               the custom when a monk was going out, saying with a composed air:
               Sir, I was not able this morning to bring in all the faggots which I
               had made ready, so with your leave I will go to the wood and bring
               them in. 
               The abbot, desiring to have better cognisance of the
               monk's offence, and not dreaming that the monk knew that he had
               been detected, was pleased with the turn matters had taken, and
               received the key gladly, at the same time giving the monk the desired
               leave. 
               So the monk withdrew, and the abbot began to consider what
               course it were best for him to take, whether to assemble the brotherhood
               and open the door in their presence, that, being witnesses of
               the delinquency, they might have no cause to murmur against him
               when he proceeded to punish the delinquent, or whether it were not
               better first to learn from the girl's own lips how it had come about.
               And reflecting that she might be the wife or daughter of some man
               who would take it ill that she should be shamed by being exposed to
               the gaze of all the monks, he determined first of all to find out who
               she was, and then to make up his mind. So he went softly to the
               cell, opened the door, and, having entered, closed it behind him.
               The girl, seeing that her visitor was none other than the abbot, quite
               lost her presence of mind, and quaking with shame began to weep.
               Master abbot surveyed her from head to foot, and seeing that she
               was fresh and comely, fell a prey, old though he was, to fleshly
               cravings no less poignant and sudden than those which the young
               monk had experienced, and began thus to commune with himself:
               Alas! why take I not my pleasure when I may, seeing that I
               never need lack for occasions of trouble and vexation of spirit? Here
               is a fair wench, and no one in the world to know. If I can bring her
               to pleasure me, I know not why I should not do so. 
               Who will
               know? No one will ever know; and sin that is hidden is half
               forgiven; this chance may never come again; so, methinks, it were
               the part of wisdom to take the boon which God bestows. 
               So
               musing, with an altogether different purpose from that with which
               he had come, he drew near the girl, and softly bade her to be
               comforted, and besought her not to weep; and so little by little he
               came at last to show her what he would be at. The girl, being
               made neither of iron nor of adamant, was readily induced to gratify
               the abbot, who after bestowing upon her many an embrace and
               kiss, got upon the monk's bed, where, being sensible, perhaps, of the
               disparity between his reverend portliness and her tender youth, and
               fearing to injure her by his excessive weight, he refrained from lying
               upon her, but laid her upon him, and in that manner disported
               himself with her for a long time. 
               The monk, who had only pretended
               to go to the wood, and had concealed himself in the dormitory,
               no sooner saw the abbot enter his cell than he was overjoyed to
               think that his plan would succeed; and when he saw that he had
               locked the door, he was well assured thereof. So he stole out of his
               hiding-place, and set his eye to an aperture through which he saw
               and heard all that the abbot did and said. 
               At length the abbot,
               having had enough of dalliance with the girl, locked her in the cell
               and returned to his chamber. Catching sight of the monk soon
               afterwards, and supposing him to have returned from the wood,
               he determined to give him a sharp reprimand and have him
               imprisoned, that he might thus secure the prey for himself alone.
               He therefore caused him to be summoned, chid him very severely and
               with a stern countenance, and ordered him to be put in prison. 
               The
               monk replied trippingly: Sir, I have not been so long in the order
               of St. Benedict as to have every particular of the rule by heart; nor
               did you teach me before to-day in what posture it behoves the monk
               to have intercourse with women, but limited your instruction to such
               matters as fasts and vigils. As, however, you have now given me
               my lesson, I promise you, if you also pardon my offence, that I will
               never repeat it, but will always follow the example which you have
               set me.
            </p>
            <p n="62">The abbot, who was a shrewd man, saw at once that the monk
               was not only more knowing than he, but had actually seen what he
               had done; nor, conscience-stricken himself, could he for shame mete
               out to the monk a measure which he himself merited. So pardon
               given, with an injunction to bury what had been seen in silence,
               they decently conveyed the young girl out of the monastery, whither,
               it is to be believed, they now and again caused her to return.

               was gone overseas as gonfalonier of the Church in a general array of
               the Christian forces. 
               Whose merits being canvassed at the court of
               Philippe le Borgne, on the eve of his departure from <span class="place">France</span> on the
               same service, a knight observed, that there was not under the stars
               a couple comparable to the Marquis and his lady; in that, while the
               Marquis was a paragon of the knightly virtues, his lady for beauty
               and honour was without a peer among all the other ladies of the
               world. These words made so deep an impression on the mind of
               the King of <span class="place">France</span> that, though he had never seen the lady, he fell
               ardently in love with her, and, being to join the armada, resolved that
               his port of embarcation should be no other than <span class="place">Genoa</span>, in order that,
               travelling thither by land, he might find a decent pretext for visiting
               the Marchioness, with whom in the absence of the Marquis he
               trusted to have the success which he desired; nor did he fail to put
               his design in execution. Having sent his main army on before, he
               took the road himself with a small company of gentlemen, and, as
               they approached the territory of the Marquis, he despatched a courier
               to the Marchioness, a day in advance, to let her know that he
               expected to breakfast with her the next morning. The lady, who
               knew her part and played it well, replied graciously, that he would
               be indeed welcome, and that his presence would be the greatest of
               all favours. She then began to commune with herself, what this
               might import, that so great a king should come to visit her in her
               husband's absence, nor was she so deluded as not to surmise that it
               was the fame of her beauty that drew him thither. Nevertheless she
               made ready to do him honour in a manner befitting her high degree,
               summoning to her presence such of the retainers as remained in the
               castle, and giving all needful directions with their advice, except that
               the order of the banquet and the choice of the dishes she reserved
               entirely to herself. Then, having caused all the hens that could be
               found in the country-side to be brought with all speed into the castle,
               she bade her cooks furnish forth the royal table with divers dishes
               made exclusively of such fare. The King arrived on the appointed
               day, and was received by the lady with great and ceremonious cheer.
               Fair and noble and gracious seemed she in the eyes of the King
               beyond all that he had conceived from the knight's words, so that he
               was lost in admiration and inly extolled her to the skies, his passion
               being the more inflamed in proportion as he found the lady surpass
               the idea which he had formed of her. A suite of rooms furnished
               with all the appointments befitting the reception of so great a king,
               was placed at his disposal, and after a little rest, breakfast-time being
               come, he and the Marchioness took their places at the same table,
               while his suite were honourably entertained at other boards according
               to their several qualities. Many courses were served with no lack
               of excellent and rare wines, whereby the King was mightily pleased,
               as also by the extraordinary beauty of the Marchioness, on whom his
               eye from time to time rested. However, as course followed course,
               the King observed with some surprise, that, though the dishes were
               diverse, yet they were all but variations of one and the same fare, to
               wit, the pullet. Besides which he knew that the domain was one
               which could not but afford plenty of divers sorts of game, and by
               forewarning the lady of his approach, he had allowed time for hunting;
               yet, for all his surprise, he would not broach the question more
               directly with her than by a reference to her hens; so, turning to her
               with a smile, he said: Madam, do hens grow in this country
               	without so much as a single cock? 
               The Marchioness, who perfectly
               apprehended the drift of the question, saw in it an opportunity,
               sent her by God, of evincing her virtuous resolution; so casting a
               haughty glance upon the King she answered thus: Sire, no; but
               	the women, though they may differ somewhat from others in dress
               	and rank, are yet of the same nature here as elsewhere. 
               The 
               significance of the banquet of pullets was made manifest to the King
               by these words, as also the virtue which they veiled. He perceived
               that on a lady of such a temper words would be wasted, and that
               force was out of the question. Wherefore, yielding to the dictates
               of prudence and honour, he was now as prompt to quench, as he
               had been inconsiderate in conceiving, his unfortunate passion for the
               lady; 
               and fearing her answers, he refrained from further jesting with
               her, and dismissing his hopes devoted himself to his breakfast, which
               done, he disarmed suspicion of the dishonourable purpose of his visit
               by an early departure, and thanking her for the honour she had
               conferred upon him, and commending her to God, took the road to

               was in our city, not long ago, a friar minor, an inquisitor in
               matters of heresy, who, albeit he strove might and main to pass
               himself off as a holy man and tenderly solicitous for the integrity
               of the Christian Faith, as they all do, yet he had as keen a
               scent for a full purse as for a deficiency of faith. Now it so
               chanced that his zeal was rewarded by the discovery of a good man
               far better furnished with money than with sense, who in an unguarded
               moment, not from defect of faith, but rather, perhaps, from
               excess of hilarity, being heated with wine, had happened to say to
               his boon companions, that he had a wine good enough for Christ
               Himself to drink. Which being reported to the inquisitor, he,
               knowing the man to be possessed of large estates and a well-lined
               purse, set to work in hot haste, cum gladiis et fustibus, to bring
               all the rigour of the law to bear upon him, designing thereby not to
               lighten the load of his victim's misbelief, but to increase the weight of
               his own purse by the florins, which he might, as he did, receive from
               him. So he cited him to his presence, and asked him whether what
               was alleged against him were true. The good man answered in the
               affirmative, and told him how it had happened. 
               Then, said our
               most holy and devout inquisitor of St. John Goldenbeard,The
               fiorino
               d'oro bore the effigy of St. John. then hast
               thou made Christ a wine-bibber, and a lover of rare vintages, as if
               He were a sot, a toper and a tavern-haunter even as one of you. And
               thinkest thou now by a few words of apology to pass this off as a
               light matter? It is no such thing as thou supposest. Thou hast
               deserved the fire; and we should but do our duty, did we inflict it
               upon thee. 
               With these and the like words in plenty he upbraided
               him, bending on him meanwhile a countenance as stern as if
               Epicurus had stood before him denying the immortality of the soul.
               In short he so terrified him that the good man was fain to employ
               certain intermediaries to anoint his palms with a liberal allowance of
               St. John Goldenmouth's grease, an excellent remedy for the disease of
               avarice which spreads like a pestilence among the clergy, and notably
               among the friars minors, who dare not touch a coin, that he might
               deal gently with him. And great being the virtue of this ointment,
               albeit no mention is made thereof by Galen in any part of his
               Medicines, it had so gracious an effect that the threatened fire gave
               place to a cross, which he was to wear as if he were bound for the
               emprise over seas; and to make the ensign more handsome the
               inquisitor ordered that it should be yellow upon a black ground.
               Besides which, after pocketing the coin, he kept him dangling about
               him for some days, bidding him by way of penance hear mass every
               morning at <span class="place">Santa Croce</span>, and afterwards wait upon him at the
               breakfast-hour, after which he was free to do as he pleased for the
               rest of the day. 
               All which he most carefully observed; and so it
               fell out that one of these mornings there were chanted at the mass
               at which he assisted the following words of the Gospel: You shall
               receive an hundredfold and shall possess eternal life. With these
               words deeply graven in his memory, he presented himself, as he was
               bidden, before the inquisitor, where he sate taking his breakfast, and
               being asked whether he had heard mass that morning, 
               he promptly answered: Yes, sir. 
               And being further asked: Heardest
               thou aught therein, as to which thou art in doubt, or hast thou any
               question to propound? 
               the good man responded: Nay indeed,
               doubt have I none of aught that I heard; but rather assured faith in
               the verity of all. One thing, however, I heard, which caused me to
               commiserate you and the rest of you friars very heartily, in regard
               of the evil plight in which you must find yourselves in the other
               world. 
               And what, said the inquisitor, was the passage that so
               moved thee to commiserate us? 
               Sir, rejoined the good man,
               it was that passage in the Gospel which says: You shall receive
               an hundredfold. 
               You heard aright, said the inquisitor; but
               why did the passage so affect you? 
               Sir, replied the good man,
               I will tell you. Since I have been in attendance here, I have seen
               a crowd of poor folk receive a daily dole, now of one, now of two,
               huge tureens of swill, being the refuse from your table, and that of
               the brothers of this convent; whereof if you are to receive an hundredfold
               in the other world, you will have so much that it will go hard
               but you are all drowned therein. 
               This raised a general laugh
               among those who sat at the inquisitor's table, whereat the inquisitor,
               feeling that their gluttony and hypocrisy had received a home-thrust,
               was very wroth, and, but that what he had already done had not
               escaped censure, would have instituted fresh proceedings against him
               in revenge for the pleasantry with which he had rebuked the baseness
               of himself and his brother friars; so in impotent wrath he bade
               him go about his business and shew himself there no more.

               illustrious renown of Messer Cane della Scala, in many ways the

               many folk from divers parts, of whom the greater number were jesters
               of every order, being already arrived, Messer Cane did suddenly (for
               some cause or another) abandon his design, and dismissed them with
               a partial recompense. One only, <span class="person">Bergamino</span> by name, a speaker
               ready and polished in a degree credible only to such as heard him,
               remained, having received no recompense or congé, still cherishing
               the hope that this omission might yet turn out to his advantage.
               But Messer Cane was possessed with the idea that whatever he
               might give <span class="person">Bergamino</span> would be far more completely thrown away
               than if he had tossed it into the fire; so never a word of the sort
               said he or sent he to him. A few days thus passed, and then <span class="person">Bergamino</span>,
               seeing that he was in no demand or request for aught that
               belonged to his office, and being also at heavy charges at his inn for
               the keep of his horses and servants, fell into a sort of melancholy;
               but still he waited a while, not deeming it expedient to leave. 
               He
               had brought with him three rich and goodly robes, given him by
               other lords, that he might make a brave show at the festival, and
               when his host began to press for payment he gave him one of the
               robes; afterwards, there being still much outstanding against him, he
               must needs, if he would tarry longer at the inn, give the host the
               second robe; after which he began to live on the third, being minded
               to remain there, as long as it would hold out, in expectation of better
               luck, and then to take his departure. 
               Now, while he was thus living
               on the third robe, it chanced that Messer Cane encountered him one
               day as he sate at breakfast with a very melancholy visage. Which
               Messer Cane observing, said, rather to tease him than expecting to

               	that thou art still so melancholy? Let me know the reason why.
               Whereupon <span class="person">Bergamino</span>, without a moment's reflection, told the
               following story, which could not have fitted his own case more
               exactly if it had been long premeditated.
            </p>
            <p n="75">My lord, you must know that Primasso was a grammarian of great
               	eminence, and excellent and quick beyond all others in versifying;
               	whereby he waxed so notable and famous that, albeit he was not
               	everywhere known by sight, yet there were scarce any that did not
               	at least by name and report know who Primasso was. 
               	Now it so
               	happened that, being once at <span class="place">Paris</span> in straitened circumstances, as
               	it was his lot to be most of his time by reason that virtue is little
               	appreciated by the powerful, he heard speak of the Abbot of Cluny,
               	who, except the Pope, is supposed to be the richest prelate, in regard
               	of his vast revenues, that the Church of God can shew; and marvellous
               	and magnificent things were told him of the perpetual court
               	which the abbot kept, and how, wherever he was, he denied not to
               	any that came there either meat or drink, so only that he preferred
               	his request while the abbot was at table. Which when
               	Primasso heard, he determined to go and see for himself what
               	magnificent state this abbot kept, for he was one that took great
               	delight in observing the ways of powerful and lordly men; wherefore
               	he asked how far from <span class="place">Paris</span> was the abbot then sojourning. He
               	was informed that the abbot was then at one of his places distant
               	perhaps six miles; which Primasso concluded he could reach in time
               	for breakfast, if he started early in the morning. When he had
               	learned the way, he found that no one else was travelling by it, and
               	fearing lest by mischance he should lose it, and so find himself where
               	it would not be easy for him to get food, he determined to obviate so
               	disagreeable a contingency by taking with him three loaves of bread--as
               	for drink, water, though not much to his taste, was, he supposed,
               	to be found everywhere. So, having disposed the loaves in the fold of
               	his tunic, he took the road and made such progress that he reached
               	the abbot's place of sojourn before the breakfast-hour. 
               	Having
               	entered, he made the circuit of the entire place, observing everything,
               	the vast array of tables, and the vast kitchen well-appointed with all
               	things needful for the preparation and service of the breakfast, and
               	saying to himself: In very truth this
               	  man is even such a magnifico
               	  as he is reported to be. While his attention was thus occupied,
               	the abbot's seneschal, it being now breakfast-time, gave order to serve
               	water for the hands, which being washen, they sat them all down to
               	breakfast. Now it so happened that Primasso was placed immediately
               	in front of the door by which the abbot must pass from his chamber
               	into the hall; 
               	in which, according to rule of his court, neither wine,
               	nor bread, nor aught else drinkable or eatable was ever set on the
               	tables before he made his appearance and was seated. The seneschal,
               	therefore, having set the tables, sent word to the abbot, that all
               	was now ready, and they waited only his pleasure. 
               	So the abbot
               	gave the word, the door of his chamber was thrown open, and he
               	took a step or two forward towards the hall, gazing straight in front
               	of him as he went. Thus it fell out that the first man on whom he
               	set eyes was Primasso, who was in very sorry trim. The abbot, who
               	knew him not by sight, no sooner saw him, than, surprised by a
               	churlish mood to which he had hitherto been an entire stranger, he
               	said to himself: 
               	So it is
               	  to such as this man that I give my hospitality;
               	and going back into the chamber he bade lock the door, and
               	asked of his attendants whether the vile fellow that sate at table
               	directly opposite the door was known to any of them, who, one and all,
               	answered in the negative. Primasso waited a little, but he was not
               	used to fast, and his journey had whetted his appetite. So, as the abbot
               	did not return, he drew out one of the loaves which he had brought
               	with him, and began to eat. The abbot, after a while, bade one of
               	his servants go see whether Primasso were gone. The servant
               	returned with the answer: No, sir, and (what is more) he is
               	  eating a loaf of bread, which he seems to have brought with him.
               	Be it so then, said the abbot, who was
               	vexed that he was not gone
               	of his own accord, but was not disposed to turn him out; let him
               	  eat his own bread, if he have any, for he shall have none of ours today.
               	By and by Primasso, having finished his first loaf, began, as
               	the abbot did not make his appearance, to eat the second; which was
               	likewise reported to the abbot, who had again sent to see if he were
               	gone. Finally, as the abbot still delayed his coming, Primasso,
               	having finished the second loaf, began upon the third; whereof, once
               	more, word was carried to the abbot, who now began to commune
               	with himself and say: Alas! my soul, what unwonted mood
               	  harbourest thou to-day? What avarice? what scorn? and of whom?
               	  I have given my hospitality, now for many a year, to whoso craved
               	  it, without looking to see whether he were gentle or churl, poor or
               	  rich, merchant or cheat, and mine eyes have seen it squandered on
               	  vile fellows without number; and nought of that which I feel
               	  towards this man ever entered my mind. Assuredly it cannot be that
               	  he is a man of no consequence, who is the occasion of this access of
               	  avarice in me. Though he seem to me a vile fellow, he must be some
               	  great man, that my mind is thus obstinately averse to do him honour.
               	Of which musings the upshot was that he sent to inquire who the
               	vile fellow was, and learning that he was Primasso, come to see if what
               	he had heard of his magnificent state were true, he was stricken with
               	shame, having heard of old Primasso's fame, and knowing him to be
               	a great man. Wherefore, being zealous to make him the amend, he
               	studied to do him honour in many ways; and after breakfast, that
               	his garb might accord with his native dignity, he caused him to be
               	nobly arrayed, and setting him upon a palfrey and filling his purse,
               	left it to his own choice, whether to go or to stay. So Primasso, with
               	a full heart, thanked him for his courtesy in terms the amplest that
               	he could command, and, having left <span class="place">Paris</span> afoot, returned thither on
               	horseback.
            </p>
            <p n="76">Messer Cane was shrewd enough to apprehend <span class="person">Bergamino</span>'s
               	meaning perfectly well without a gloss, and said with a smile:
               	<span class="person">Bergamino</span>, thy parable is apt, and declares to me very plainly
               	  thy losses, my avarice, and what thou desirest of me. And in good
               	  sooth this access of avarice, of which thou art the occasion, is the
               	  first that I have experienced. But I will expel the intruder with
               	  the bâton which thou thyself hast furnished. 
               	So he paid <span class="person">Bergamino</span>'s

                     man, likewise a jester, reprehended not without success the greed

               who was known as Messer Ermino de' Grimaldi, and whose wealth,
               both in lands and money, was generally supposed to be far in excess
               of that of any other burgher then in <span class="place">Italy</span>; and as in wealth he was
               without a rival in <span class="place">Italy</span>, so in meanness and avarice there was not
               any in the entire world, however richly endowed with those qualities,
               whom he did not immeasurably surpass, insomuch that, not only
               did he keep a tight grip upon his purse when honour was to be done
               to another, but in his personal expenditure, even upon things meet
               and proper, contrary to the general custom of the Genoese, whose
               wont is to array themselves nobly, he was extremely penurious, as
               also in his outlay upon his table. Wherefore, not without just cause,
               folk had dropped his surname de' Grimaldi, and called him instead
               Messer Ermino Avarizia. While thus by thrift his wealth waxed
               greater and greater, it so chanced that there came to <span class="place">Genoa</span> a jester
               of good parts, a man debonair and ready of speech, his name
               Guglielmo Borsiere, whose like is not to be found to-day, when
               jesters (to the great reproach be it spoken of those that claim the
               name and reputation of gentlemen) are rather to be called asses,
               being without courtly breeding, and formed after the coarse pattern
               of the basest of churls. And whereas in the days of which I speak
               they made it their business, they spared no pains, to compose quarrels,
               to allay heart-burnings, between gentlemen, or arrange marriages, or
               leagues of amity, ministering meanwhile relief to jaded minds and
               solace to courts by the sprightly sallies of their wit, and with keen
               sarcasm, like fathers, censuring churlish manners, being also satisfied
               with very trifling guerdons; nowadays all their care is to spend their
               time in scandal-mongering, in sowing discord, in saying, and (what
               is worse) in doing in the presence of company things churlish and
               flagitious, in bringing accusations, true or false, of wicked, shameful
               or flagitious conduct against one another; and in drawing gentlemen
               into base and nefarious practices by sinister and insidious arts. 
               And
               by these wretched and depraved lords he is held most dear and best
               rewarded whose words and deeds are the most atrocious, to the
               great reproach and scandal of the world of to-day; whereby it is
               abundantly manifest that virtue has departed from the earth, leaving
               a degenerate generation to wallow in the lowest depths of vice.

               stress of just indignation I have deviated somewhat further than I

               well received by all the gentlemen of <span class="place">Genoa</span>; and tarrying some
               days in the city, heard much of the meanness and avarice of Messer
               Ermino, and was curious to see him. Now Messer Ermino had
               heard that this Guglielmo Borsiere was a man of good parts, and,
               notwithstanding his avarice, having in him some sparks of good
               breeding, received him with words of hearty greeting and a gladsome
               mien, and conversed freely with him and of divers matters, and so
               conversing, took him with other Genoese that were of his company
               to a new and very beautiful house which he had built, 
               and after
               shewing him over the whole of it, said to him: Now, Messer
               Guglielmo, you have seen and heard many things; could you suggest
               to me something, the like of which has not hitherto been seen,
               which I might have painted here in the saloon of this house? 
               To
               which ill-judged question Guglielmo replied: Sir, it would not, I
               think, be in my power to suggest anything the like of which has
               never been seen, unless it were a sneeze or something similar; but
               if it so please you, I have something to suggest, which, I think, you
               have never seen. 
               Prithee, what may that be? said Messer
               Ermino, not expecting to get the answer which he got. 
               For
               Guglielmo replied forthwith: Paint Courtesy here; 
               which Messer
               Ermino had no sooner heard, than he was so stricken with shame
               that his disposition underwent a complete change, and he said:
               Messer Guglielmo, I will see to it that Courtesy is here painted
               in such wise that neither you nor any one else shall ever again have
               reason to tell me that I have not seen or known that virtue. 
               And
               henceforward (so enduring was the change wrought by Guglielmo's
               words) there was not in <span class="place">Genoa</span>, while he lived, any gentleman so
               liberal and so gracious and so lavish of honour both to strangers and

                  <p n="88">As stars in the serene expanse of heaven, as in spring-time
                     flowers in the green pastures, so, honourable damsels, in the hour of
                     rare and excellent converse is wit with its bright sallies. 
                     Which,
                     being brief, are much more proper for ladies than for men, seeing
                     that prolixity of speech, when brevity is possible, is much less allowable
                     to them; albeit (shame be to us all and all our generation) few
                     ladies or none are left to-day who understand aught that is wittily
                     said, or understanding are able to answer it. For the place of those
                     graces of the spirit which distinguished the ladies of the past has now
                     been usurped by adornments of the person; and she whose dress is
                     most richly and variously and curiously dight, accounts herself more
                     worthy to be had in honour, forgetting, that, were one but so to
                     array him, an ass would carry a far greater load of finery than any
                     of them, and for all that be not a whit the more deserving of honour.
                     I blush to say this, for in censuring others I condemn myself.
                     Tricked out, bedecked, bedizened thus, we are either silent and
                     impassive as statues, or, if we answer aught that is said to us, much
                     better were it we had held our peace. And we make believe,
                     forsooth, that our failure to acquit ourselves in converse with our
                     equals of either sex does but proceed from guilelessness; dignifying
                     stupidity by the name of modesty, as if no lady could be modest and
                     converse with other folk than her maid or laundress or bake-house
                     woman; which if Nature had intended, as we feign she did, she would
                     have set other limits to our garrulousness. 
                     True it is that in this, as
                     in other matters, time and place and person are to be regarded;
                     because it sometimes happens that a lady or gentleman thinking by
                     some sally of wit to put another to shame, has rather been put to
                     shame by that other, having failed duly to estimate their relative
                     powers. Wherefore, that you may be on your guard against such
                     error, and, further, that in you be not exemplified the common
                     proverb, to wit, that women do ever and on all occasions choose the
                     worst, I trust that this last of to-day's stories, which falls to me to
                     tell, may serve you as a lesson; that, as you are distinguished from
                     others by nobility of nature, so you may also shew yourselves
                     separate from them by excellence of manners.

               </div></em><p n="89">There lived not many years ago, perhaps yet lives, in <span class="place">Bologna</span>, a
               very great physician, so great that the fame of his skill was noised
               abroad throughout almost the entire world.
            </p>
            <p n="90">Now Master Alberto (such was his name) was of so noble a
               temper that, being now nigh upon seventy years of age, and all but
               devoid of natural heat of body, he was yet receptive of the flames of
               love; and having at an assembly seen a very beautiful widow lady,
               Madonna Malgherida de' Ghisolieri, as some say, and being charmed
               with her beyond measure, was, notwithstanding his age, no less
               ardently enamoured than a young man, insomuch that he was not
               well able to sleep at night, unless during the day he had seen the fair
               lady's lovely and delicate features. Wherefore he began to frequent
               the vicinity of her house, passing to and fro in front of it, now on
               foot now on horseback, as occasion best served. 
               Which she and many
               other ladies perceiving, made merry together more than once, to see
               a man of his years and discretion in love, as if they deemed that this
               most delightful passion of love were only fit for empty-headed youths,
               and could not in men be either harboured or engendered. 
               Master Alberto thus continuing to haunt the front of the house, it so
               happened that one feast-day the lady with other ladies was seated
               before her door, and Master Alberto's approach being thus observed
               by them for some time before he arrived, they complotted to receive
               him and shew him honour, and then to rally him on his love; 
               and so they did, rising with one accord to receive him, bidding him
               welcome, and ushering him into a cool courtyard, where they regaled
               him with the finest wines and comfits; which done, in a tone of
               refined and sprightly banter they asked him how it came about that
               he was enamoured of this fair lady, seeing that she was beloved of
               many a fine gentleman of youth and spirit. 
               Master Alberto, being
               thus courteously assailed, put a blithe face on it, and answered:
               Madam, my love for you need surprise none that is conversant
               with such matters, and least of all you that are worthy of it. 
               And though old men, of course, have lost the strength which love demands
               for its full fruition, yet are they not therefore without the
               good intent and just appreciation of what beseems the accepted lover,
               but indeed understand it far better than young men, by reason that
               they have more experience. 
               My hope in thus old aspiring to love
               you, who are loved by so many young men, is founded on what I
               have frequently observed of ladies' ways at lunch, when they trifle
               with the lupin and the leek. In the leek no part is good, but the
               head is at any rate not so bad as the rest, and indeed not unpalatable;
               you, however, for the most part, following a depraved taste, hold it in
               your hand and munch the leaves, which are not only of no account
               but actually distasteful. How am I to know, madam, that in your
               selection of lovers, you are not equally eccentric? In which case I
               should be the man of your choice, and the rest would be cast aside.
               Whereto the gentle lady, somewhat shame-stricken, as were also her
               fair friends, thus made answer: Master Alberto, our presumption
               has received from you a most just and no less courteous reproof; but
               your love is dear to me, as should ever be that of a wise and worthy
               man. And therefore, saving my honour, I am yours, entirely and
               devotedly at your pleasure and command. 
               This speech brought
               Master Alberto to his feet, and the others also rising, he thanked the
               lady for her courtesy, bade her a gay and smiling adieu, and so
               left the house. Thus the lady, not considering on whom she exercised
               her wit, thinking to conquer was conquered herself: against
               which mishap you, if you are discreet, will ever be most strictly on
               your guard.

         <h3 class="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
         <p n="91">As the young ladies and the three young men finished their story-telling
            the sun was westering and the heat of the day in great
            measure abated. Which their queen observing, debonairly thus she
            spoke: Now, dear gossips, my day of sovereignty draws to a close,
            	and nought remains for me to do but to give you a new queen, by
            	whom on the morrow our common life may be ordered as she may
            	deem best in a course of seemly pleasure; and though there seems to
            	be still some interval between day and night, yet, as whoso does not
            	in some degree anticipate the course of time, cannot well provide for
            	the future; and in order that what the new queen shall decide to be
            	meet for the morrow may be made ready beforehand, I decree that
            	from this time forth the days begin at this hour. And so in reverent
            	submission to Him, in whom is the life of all beings, for our comfort
            	and solace we commit the governance of our realm for the morrow
            	into the hands of Queen <span class="person">Filomena</span>, most discreet of damsels. 
            So saying she arose, took the laurel wreath from her brow, and with a
            gesture of reverence set it on the brow of <span class="person">Filomena</span>, whom she then,
            and after her all the other ladies and the young men, saluted as
            queen, doing her due and graceful homage.
         </p>
         <p n="92">Queen <span class="person">Filomena</span> modestly blushed a little to find herself thus
            invested with the sovereignty; but, being put on her mettle by
            <span class="person">Pampinea</span>'s recent admonitions, she was minded not to seem awkward,
            and soon recovered her composure. She then began by confirming
            all the appointments made by <span class="person">Pampinea</span>, and making all needful
            arrangements for the following morning and evening, which they
            were to pass where they then were. Whereupon she thus spoke:
            Dearest gossips, though, thanks rather to <span class="person">Pampinea</span>'s courtesy than
            	to merit of mine, I am made queen of you all; yet I am not on
            	that account minded to have respect merely to my own judgment in
            	the governance of our life, but to unite your wisdom with mine; and
            	that you may understand what I think of doing, and by consequence
            	may be able to amplify or curtail it at your pleasure, I will in few
            	words make known to you my purpose. The course observed by
            	<span class="person">Pampinea</span> to-day, if I have judged aright, seems to be alike commendable
            	and delectable; wherefore, until by lapse of time, or for some
            	other cause, it grow tedious, I purpose not to alter it. 
            	So when we
            	have arranged for what we have already taken in hand, we will go
            	hence and enjoy a short walk; at sundown we will sup in the cool;
            	and we will then sing a few songs and otherwise divert ourselves,
            	until it is time to go to sleep. To-morrow we will rise in the cool
            	of the morning, and after enjoying another walk, each at his or her
            	sweet will, we will return, as to-day, and in due time break our fast,
            	dance, sleep, and having risen, will here resume our story-telling,
            	wherein, methinks, pleasure and profit unite in superabundant
            	measure. True it is that <span class="person">Pampinea</span>, by reason of her late election to
            	the sovereignty, neglected one matter, which I mean to introduce,
            	to wit, the circumscription of the topic of our story-telling, and its
            	preassignment, that each may be able to premeditate some apt story
            	bearing upon the theme; and seeing that from the beginning of the
            	world Fortune has made men the sport of divers accidents, and so it
            	will continue until the end, the theme, so please you, shall in each
            	case be the same; 
            	to wit, the fortune of such as after divers adventures
            	  have at last attained a goal of unexpected felicity.
         </p>
         <p n="93">The ladies and the young men alike commended the rule thus
            laid down, and agreed to follow it. <span class="person">Dioneo</span>, however, when the rest
            had done speaking, said: Madam, as all the rest have said, so say
            	I, briefly, that the rule prescribed by you is commendable and delectable;
            	but of your especial grace I crave a favour, which, I trust,
            	may be granted and continued to me, so long as our company shall
            	endure; which favour is this: that I be not bound by the assigned
            	theme if I am not so minded, but that I have leave to choose such
            	topic as best shall please me. And lest any suppose that I crave this
            	grace as one that has not stories ready to hand, I am henceforth
            	content that mine be always the last. 
            The queen, knowing him to
            be a merry and facetious fellow, and feeling sure that he only craved
            this favour in order that, if the company were jaded, he might have
            an opportunity to recreate them by some amusing story, gladly, with
            the consent of the rest, granted his petition. 
            She then rose, and
            attended by the rest sauntered towards a stream, which, issuing clear
            as crystal from a neighbouring hill, precipitated itself into a valley
            shaded by trees close set amid living rock and fresh green herbage.
            Bare of foot and arm they entered the stream, and roving hither and
            thither amused themselves in divers ways till in due time they returned
            to the palace, and gaily supped. Supper ended, the queen sent for
            instruments of music, and bade <span class="person">Lauretta</span> lead a dance, while <span class="person">Emilia</span>
            was to sing a song accompanied by <span class="person">Dioneo</span> on the lute.
         </p>
         <p n="94">Accordingly <span class="person">Lauretta</span> led a dance, while <span class="person">Emilia</span> with passion
            sang the following song:
         </p><em>
            <div class="song">
               	So fain I am of my own loveliness,
               	I hope, nor think not e'er
               	The weight to feel of other amorousness.
               
               	When in the mirror I my face behold,
               	That see I there which doth my mind content,
               	Nor any present hap or memory old
               	May me deprive of such sweet ravishment.
               	Where else, then, should I find such blandishment
               	Of sight and sense that e'er
               	My heart should know another amorousness?
               
               	Nor need I fear lest the fair thing retreat,
               	When fain I am my solace to renew;
               	Rather, I know, 'twill me advance to meet,
               	To pleasure me, and shew so sweet a view
               	That speech or thought of none its semblance true

               	Thereon as more intent I gaze, the fire
               	Waxeth within me hourly more and more,
               	Myself I yield thereto, myself entire,
               	And foretaste have of what it hath in store,
               	And hope of greater joyance than before,
               	Nay, such as ne'er
               	None knew; for ne'er was felt such amorousness.

            furnished much matter of thought to some, was followed by some
            other dances, and part of the brief night being thus spent, the queen
            proclaimed the first day ended, and bade light the torches, that all
            might go to rest until the following morning; and so, seeking their
            several chambers, to rest they went.
