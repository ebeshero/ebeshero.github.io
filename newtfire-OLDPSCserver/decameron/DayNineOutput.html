         <p>Endeth here the eighth day of the Decameron, beginneth
            the ninth, in which, under the rule of <span class="person">Emilia</span>, discourse

            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>The luminary, before whose splendour the night takes wing, had
               already changed the eighth heavenI. e. in the Ptolemaic
               system,
               the region of the fixed stars. from azure to the lighter
               blue,Cilestro: a word for which we have no exact equivalent, the
               dominant
               note of the Italian sky, when the sun is well up, being its intense
               luminosity.
               and in the meads the flowerets were beginning to lift their heads,
               when <span class="person">Emilia</span>, being risen, roused her fair gossips, and, likewise, the
               young men. And so the queen leading the way at an easy pace, and
               the rest of the company following, they hied them to a copse at no
               great distance from the palace. Where, being entered, they saw the
               goats and stags and other wild creatures, as if witting that in this
               time of pestilence they had nought to fear from the hunter, stand
               awaiting them with no more sign of fear than if they had been
               tamed: and so, making now towards this, now towards the other of
               them as if to touch them, they diverted themselves for a while by
               making them skip and run. But, as soon as the sun was in the
               ascendant, by common consent they turned back,  and whoso met
               them, garlanded as they were with oak-leaves, and carrying store of
               fragrant herbs or flowers in their hands might well have said:
               Either shall death not vanquish these, or they will meet it with a
               light heart.  So, slowly wended they their way, now singing, now
               bandying quips and merry jests, to the palace, where they found all
               things in order meet, and their servants in blithe and merry cheer.
               A while they rested, nor went they to table until six ditties, each
               gayer than that which went before, had been sung by the young
               men and the ladies; which done, they washed their hands, and all by
               the queen's command were ranged by the seneschal at the table;
               and, the viands being served, they cheerily took their meal: wherefrom
               being risen, they trod some measures to the accompaniment
               of music; and then, by the queen's command, whoso would betook
               him to rest.  However, the accustomed hour being come, they all
               gathered at the wonted spot for their discoursing, and the queen,
               bending her regard upon <span class="person">Filomena</span>, bade her make a beginning of
               the day's story-telling, which she with a smile did on this wise:

            <h3 style="text-align:center">Novel I</h3>
            <p>Madonna <span class="place">France</span>sca, having two lovers, the one Rinuccio,
               the other Alessandro, by name, and loving neither of
               them, induces the one to simulate a corpse in a tomb,
               and the other to enter the tomb to fetch him out:
               whereby, neither satisfying her demands, she artfully
               rids herself of both.
            </p>
            <div class="frame">
               <p>Madam, since so it pleases you, well pleased am I that in this
                  vast, this boundless field of discourse, which you, our Lady Bountiful,
                  have furnished us withal, 'tis mine to run the first course; wherein
                  if I do well, I doubt not that those, who shall follow me, will do
                  not only well but better.  Such, sweet my ladies, has been the tenor
                  of our discourse, that times not a few the might of Love, how great
                  and singular it is, has been set forth; but yet I doubt the topic is not
                  exhausted, nor would it be so, though we should continue to speak
                  of nought else for the space of a full year.  And as Love not only
                  leads lovers to debate with themselves whether they were not best to
                  die, but also draws them into the houses of the dead in quest of the
                  dead, I am minded in this regard to tell you a story, wherein you
                  will not only discern the power of Love, but will also learn how the
                  ready wit of a worthy lady enabled her to disembarrass herself of two
                  lovers, whose love was displeasing to her.
               </p>
            </div>
            <p>Know, then, that there dwelt aforetime in the city of <span class="place">Pistoia</span> a
               most beauteous widow lady, of whom it so befell that two of our
               citizens, the one Rinuccio Palermini, the other Alessandro Chiarmontesi,
               by name, tarrying at <span class="place">Pistoia</span>, for that they were banished
               from <span class="place">Florence</span>, became, neither witting how it stood with the other,
               in the last degree enamoured.  Wherefore each used all his arts
               to win the love of Madonna <span class="place">France</span>sca de' Lazzari--such was the
               lady's name--and she, being thus continually plied with ambassages
               and entreaties on the part of both, and having indiscreetly lent ear
               to them from time to time, found it no easy matter discreetly to
               extricate herself, when she was minded to be rid of their pestering,
               until it occurred to her to adopt the following expedient, to wit,
               to require of each a service, such as, though not impracticable,
               she deemed none would actually perform, to the end that, they
               making default, she might have a decent and colourable pretext
               for refusing any longer to receive their ambassages. Which expedient
               was on this wise.  One day there died in <span class="place">Pistoia</span>, and was
               buried in a tomb outside the church of the Friars Minors, a man,
               who, though his forbears had been gentlefolk, was reputed the very
               worst man, not in <span class="place">Pistoia</span> only, but in all the world,  and therewithal
               he was of form and feature so preternaturally hideous that
               whoso knew him not could scarce see him for the first time without
               a shudder. Now, the lady pondering her design on the day of this
               man's death, it occurred to her that he might in a measure subserve
               its accomplishment:  wherefore she said to her maid: Thou
               knowest to what worry and annoyance I am daily put by the
               ambassages of these two Florentines, Rinuccio and Alessandro.
               Now I am not disposed to gratify either of them with my love, and
               therefore, to shake them off, I am minded, as they make such great
               protestations, to put them to the proof by requiring of each something
               which I am sure he will not perform, and thus to rid myself
               of their pestering:  so list what I mean to do. Thou knowest that
               this morning there was interred in the ground of the Friars Minors
               this Scannadio (such was the name of the bad man of whom we
               spoke but now) whose aspect, while he yet lived, appalled even the
               bravest among us.  Thou wilt therefore go privily to Alessandro,
               and say to him: 'Madonna <span class="place">France</span>sca sends thee word by me that
               the time is now come when thou mayst win that which thou hast
               so much desired, to wit, her love and joyance thereof, if thou be so
               minded, on the following terms.  For a reason, which thou shalt
               learn hereafter, one of her kinsmen is to bring home to her to-night
               the corpse of Scannadio, who was buried this morning; and she,
               standing in mortal dread of this dead man, would fain not see him;
               wherefore she prays thee to do her a great service, and be so good as
               to get thee this evening at the hour of first sleep to the tomb wherein
               Scannadio is buried, and go in, and having wrapped thyself in his
               grave-clothes, lie there, as thou wert Scannadio himself, until one
               come for thee, when thou must say never a word, but let him carry
               thee forth, and bear thee to Madonna <span class="place">France</span>sca's house, where she
               will give thee welcome, and let thee stay with her, until thou art
               minded to depart, and, for the rest, thou wilt leave it to her.'  And
               if he says that he will gladly do so, well and good; if not, then thou
               wilt tell him from me, never more to shew himself where I am,
               and, as he values his life, to have a care to send me no more ambassages.
               Which done, thou wilt go to Rinuccio Palermini, and
               wilt say to him: 'Madonna <span class="place">France</span>sca lets thee know that she is
               ready in all respects to comply with thy wishes, so thou wilt do her
               a great service, which is on this wise: to-night, about midnight,
               thou must go to the tomb wherein was this morning interred
               Scannadio, and saying never a word, whatever thou mayst hear
               or otherwise be ware of, bear him gently forth to Madonna
               <span class="place">France</span>sca's house,  where thou shalt learn wherefore she requires
               this of thee, and shalt have thy solace of her; and if thou art not
               minded to obey her in this, see that thou never more send her
               ambassage.'
            </p>
            <p>The maid did her mistress's errand, omitting nothing, to both
               the men, and received from each the same answer, to wit, that to
               pleasure the lady, he would adventure a journey to hell, to say
               nothing of entering a tomb. With which answer the maid returned
               to the lady, who waited to see if they would be such fools as to make
               it good.  Night came, and at the hour of first sleep Alessandro
               Chiarmontesi, stripped to his doublet, quitted his house, and bent his
               steps towards Scannadio's tomb, with intent there to take the dead
               man's place. As he walked, there came upon him a great fear,  and
               he fell a saying to himself: Ah! what a fool am I! Whither go
               I? How know I that her kinsmen, having detected my love, and
               surmising that which is not, have not put her upon requiring this of
               me, in order that they may slay me in the tomb? In which event I
               alone should be the loser, for nought would ever be heard of it, so
               that they would escape scot-free. Or how know I but that 'tis
               some machination of one of my ill-wishers, whom perchance she
               loves, and is therefore minded to abet?  And again quoth he to
               himself: But allowing that 'tis neither the one nor the other, and
               that her kinsmen are really to carry me to her house, I scarce believe
               that 'tis either that they would fain embrace Scannadio's corpse themselves,
               or let her do so: rather it must be that they have a mind to
               perpetrate some outrage upon it, for that, perchance, he once did
               them an evil turn.  She bids me say never a word, no matter what
               I may hear or be otherwise ware of. Suppose they were to pluck
               out my eyes, or my teeth, or cut off my hands, or treat me to some
               other horse-play of the like sort, how then? how could I keep
               quiet?  And if I open my mouth, they will either recognize me,
               and perchance do me a mischief, or, if they spare me, I shall have
               been at pains for nought, for they will not leave me with the lady,
               and she will say that I disobeyed her command, and I shall never
               have aught of her favours.
            </p>
            <p>As thus he communed with himself, he was on the point of
               turning back; but his overmastering love plied him with opposing
               arguments of such force that he kept on his way, and reached
               the tomb; which having opened, he entered, and after stripping
               Scannadio, and wrapping himself in the grave-clothes, closed it, and
               laid himself down in Scannadio's place. He then fell a thinking of the
               dead man, and his manner of life, and the things which he had heard
               tell of as happening by night, and in other less appalling places than
               the houses of the dead;  whereby all the hairs of his head stood on end,
               and he momently expected Scannadio to rise and cut his throat.
               However, the ardour of his love so fortified him that he overcame
               these and all other timorous apprehensions, and lay as if he were
               dead, awaiting what should betide him.
            </p>
            <p>Towards midnight Rinuccio, bent likewise upon fulfilling his
               lady's behest, sallied forth of his house, revolving as he went divers
               forebodings of possible contingencies, as that, having Scannadio's
               corpse upon his shoulders, he might fall into the hands of the Signory,
               and be condemned to the fire as a wizard, or that, should the affair
               get wind, it might embroil him with his kinsfolk, or the like, which
               gave him pause.  But then with a revulsion of feeling: Shall I,
               quoth he to himself, deny this lady, whom I so much have loved and
               love, the very first thing that she asks of me? And that too when
               I am thereby to win her favour? No, though 'twere as much as my
               life is worth, far be it from me to fail of keeping my word. So on
               he fared, and arrived at the tomb, which he had no difficulty in
               opening, and being entered, laid hold of  Alessandro, who, though
               in mortal fear, had given no sign of life, by the feet, and dragged
               him forth, and having hoisted him on to his shoulders, bent his steps
               towards the lady's house. And as he went, being none too careful
               of Alessandro, he swung him from time to time against one or other
               of the angles of certain benches that were by the wayside; and
               indeed the night was so dark and murky that he could not see where
               he was going.  And when he was all but on the threshold of the
               lady's house (she standing within at a window with her maid, to mark
               if Rinuccio would bring Alessandro, and being already provided with
               an excuse for sending them both away), it so befell that the patrol of
               the Signory, who were posted in the street in dead silence, being on
               the look-out for a certain bandit, hearing the tramp of Rinuccio's
               feet, suddenly shewed a light, the better to know what was toward,
               and whither to go, and advancing targes and lances,  cried out:
               Who goes there? Whereupon Rinuccio, having little leisure
               for deliberation, let Alessandro fall, and took to flight as fast as his
               legs might carry him. Alessandro, albeit encumbered by the graveclothes,
               which were very long, also jumped up and made off.  By
               the light shewn by the patrol the lady had very plainly perceived
               Rinuccio, with Alessandro on his back, as also that Alessandro had
               the grave-clothes upon him; and much did she marvel at the daring
               of both, but, for all that, she laughed heartily to see Rinuccio drop
               Alessandro, and Alessandro run away.  Overjoyed at the turn the
               affair had taken, and praising God that He had rid her of their harass,
               she withdrew from the window, and betook her to her chamber,
               averring to her maid that for certain they must both be mightily in
               love with her, seeing that 'twas plain they had both done her
               bidding.
            </p>
            <p>Crestfallen and cursing his evil fortune, Rinuccio nevertheless
               went not home, but, as soon as the street was clear of the patrol,
               came back to the spot where he had dropped Alessandro, and stooped
               down and began feeling about, if haply he might find him, and so do
               his devoir to the lady; but, as he found him not, he supposed the
               patrol must have borne him thence, and so at last home he went; as
               did also Alessandro, knowing not what else to do, and deploring his
               mishap.  On the morrow, Scannadio's tomb being found open and
               empty, for Alessandro had thrown the corpse into the vault below,
               all <span class="place">Pistoia</span> debated of the matter with no small diversity of opinion,
               the fools believing that Scannadio had been carried off by devils.
               Neither of the lovers, however, forbore to make suit to the lady for
               her favour and love, telling her what he had done, and what had happened,
               and praying her to have him excused that he had not perfectly
               carried out her instructions. But she, feigning to believe neither of
               them, disposed of each with the same curt answer, to wit, that, as he
               had not done her bidding, she would never do aught for him.

               <p>Dearest ladies, 'twas cleverly done of Madonna
                  <span class="place">France</span>sca, to disembarrass herself in the way we have heard: but I
                  have to tell of a young nun, who by a happy retort, and the favour
                  of Fortune, delivered herself from imminent peril.  And as you
                  know that there are not a few most foolish folk, who, notwithstanding
                  their folly, take upon themselves the governance and correction of
                  others; so you may learn from my story that Fortune at times justly
                  puts them to shame; which befell the abbess, who was the superior
                  of the nun of whom I am about to speak.
               </p>
            </div>
            <p>You are to know, then, that in a convent in <span class="place">Lombardy</span> of very
               great repute for strict and holy living there was, among other ladies
               that there wore the veil, a young woman of noble family, and extraordinary
               beauty. Now <span class="person">Isabetta</span>--for such was her name--having
               speech one day of one of her kinsmen at the grate, became enamoured
               of a fine young gallant that was with him; who, seeing her to be
               very fair, and reading her passion in her eyes, was kindled with a like
               flame for her: which mutual and unsolaced love they bore a great
               while not without great suffering to both.  But at length, both being
               intent thereon, the gallant discovered a way by which he might with
               all secrecy visit his nun; and she approving, he paid her not one visit
               only, but many, to their no small mutual solace.  But, while thus they
               continued their intercourse, it so befell that one night one of the
               sisters observed him take his leave of <span class="person">Isabetta</span> and depart, albeit neither
               he nor she was ware that they had thus been discovered. The sister
               imparted what she had seen to several others. At first they were
               minded to denounce her to the abbess, one Madonna Usimbalda,
               who was reputed by the nuns, and indeed by all that knew her, to
               be a good and holy woman; but on second thoughts they deemed it
               expedient, that there might be no room for denial, to cause the abbess
               to take her and the gallant in the act. So they held their peace, and
               arranged between them to keep her in watch and close espial, that
               they might catch her unawares.  Of which practice <span class="person">Isabetta</span> recking,
               witting nought, it so befell that one night, when she had her lover
               to see her, the sisters that were on the watch were soon ware of it,
               and at what they deemed the nick of time parted into two companies,
               of which one mounted guard at the threshold of <span class="person">Isabetta</span>'s cell, while
               the other hasted to the abbess's chamber, and knocking at the door,
               roused her, and as soon as they heard her voice, said: Up, Madam,
               without delay: we have discovered that <span class="person">Isabetta</span> has a young man
               with her in her cell.
            </p>
            <p>Now that night the abbess had with her a priest whom she used
               not seldom to have conveyed to her in a chest; and the report of the
               sisters making her apprehensive lest for excess of zeal and hurry they
               should force the door open, she rose in a trice; and huddling on
               her clothes as best she might in the dark, instead of the veil that
               they wear, which they call the psalter, she caught up the priest's
               breeches, and having clapped them on her head,  hied her forth,
               and locked the door behind her, saying: Where is this woman
               accursed of God?  And so, guided by the sisters, all so agog to catch
               <span class="person">Isabetta</span> a sinning that they perceived not what manner of headgear
               the abbess wore, she made her way to the cell, and with their
               aid broke open the door; and entering they found the two lovers
               abed in one another's arms; who, as it were, thunderstruck to be
               thus surprised, lay there, witting not what to do.  The sisters took
               the young nun forthwith, and by command of the abbess brought her
               to the chapter-house. The gallant, left behind in the cell, put on
               his clothes and waited to see how the affair would end, being minded
               to make as many nuns as he might come at pay dearly for any despite
               that might be done his mistress, and to bring her off with him.  The
               abbess, seated in the chapter-house with all her nuns about her, and
               all eyes bent upon the culprit, began giving her the severest reprimand
               that ever woman got, for that by her disgraceful and abominable conduct,
               should it get wind, she had sullied the fair fame of the convent;
               whereto she added menaces most dire.  Shamefast and timorous, the
               culprit essayed no defence, and her silence begat pity of her in
               the rest; but, while the abbess waxed more and more voluble, it
               chanced that the girl raised her head and espied the abbess's headgear,
               and the points that hung down on this side and that.  The significance
               whereof being by no means lost upon her, she quite plucked
               up heart, and: Madam, quoth she, so help you God, tie up
               your coif, and then you may say what you will to me.  Whereto
               the abbess, not understanding her, replied: What coif, lewd
               woman? So thou hast the effrontery to jest! Think'st thou that
               what thou hast done is a matter meet for jests?  Whereupon:
               Madam, quoth the girl again, I pray you, tie up your coif, and
               then you may say to me whatever you please. Which occasioned
               not a few of the nuns to look up at the abbess's head, and the abbess
               herself to raise her hands thereto, and so she and they at one and the
               same time apprehended <span class="person">Isabetta</span>'s meaning.  Wherefore the abbess,
               finding herself detected by all in the same sin, and that no disguise
               was possible, changed her tone, and held quite another sort of language
               than before, the upshot of which was that 'twas impossible to withstand
               the assaults of the flesh, and that, accordingly, observing due
               secrecy as theretofore, all might give themselves a good time, as they
               had opportunity. So, having dismissed <span class="person">Isabetta</span> to rejoin her lover in
               her cell, she herself returned to lie with her priest.  And many a
               time thereafter, in spite of the envious, <span class="person">Isabetta</span> had her gallant to
               see her, the others, that lacked lovers, doing in secret the best they
               might to push their fortunes.

               <p>Fairest my ladies, the uncouth judge from the Marches, or
                  whom I told you yesterday, took from the tip of my tongue a story
                  of <span class="person">Calandrino</span>, which I was on the point of narrating: and as nought
                  can be said of him without mightily enhancing our jollity, albeit not
                  a little has already been said touching him and his comrades, I will
                  now give you the story which I had meant yesterday to give you.
               </p>
            </div>
            <p>Who they were, this <span class="person">Calandrino</span> and the others that I am to tell of
               in this story, has already been sufficiently explained; wherefore,
               without more ado, I say that one of <span class="person">Calandrino</span>'s aunts having died,
               leaving him two hundred pounds in petty cash, <span class="person">Calandrino</span> gave out
               that he was minded to purchase an estate, and, as if he had had ten
               thousand florins of gold to invest, engaged every broker in <span class="place">Florence</span>
               to treat for him, the negotiation always falling through, as soon as
               the price was named.  Bruno and Buffalmacco, knowing what was
               afoot, told him again and again that he had better give himself a
               jolly time with them than go about buying earth as if he must needs
               make pellets;I.e. bolts of clay for the cross-bow. but
               so far were they from effecting their purpose,
               that they could not even prevail upon him to give them a single
               meal.  Whereat as one day they grumbled, being joined by a comrade
               of theirs, one Nello, also a painter, they all three took counsel how
               they might wet their whistle at <span class="person">Calandrino</span>'s expense; and, their
               plan being soon concerted, the next morning <span class="person">Calandrino</span> was scarce
               gone out, when Nello met him, saying: Good day, <span class="person">Calandrino</span>:
               whereto <span class="person">Calandrino</span> replied: God give thee a good day and a
               good year. Nello then drew back a little, and looked him steadily
               in the face, until: What seest thou to stare at? quoth <span class="person">Calandrino</span>.
               Hadst thou no pain in the night? returned Nello; thou
               seemest not thyself to me. Which <span class="person">Calandrino</span> no sooner heard,
               than he began to be disquieted, and:  Alas! How sayst thou?
               quoth he. What tak'st thou to be the matter with me?  Why,
               as to that I have nothing to say, returned Nello; but thou
               seemest to be quite changed: perchance 'tis not what I suppose;
               and with that he left him.
            </p>
            <p><span class="person">Calandrino</span>, anxious, though he could not in the least have said
               why, went on; and soon Buffalmacco, who was not far off, and had
               observed him part from Nello, made up to him, and greeted him,
               asking him if he was not in pain. I cannot say, replied <span class="person">Calandrino</span>;
               'twas but now that Nello told me that I looked quite changed:
               can it be that there is aught the matter with me? Aught?
               quoth Buffalmacco, ay, indeed, there might be a trifle the matter
               with thee. Thou look'st to be half dead, man.  <span class="person">Calandrino</span> now
               began to think he must have a fever. And then up came Bruno;
               and the first thing he said was: Why, <span class="person">Calandrino</span>, how ill thou
               look'st! thy appearance is that of a corpse. How dost thou feel?
               To be thus accosted by all three left no doubt in <span class="person">Calandrino</span>'s mind
               that he was ill, and so: What shall I do? quoth he, in a great
               fright.  My advice, replied Bruno, is that thou go home and
               get thee to bed and cover thee well up, and send thy water to
               Master Simone, who, as thou knowest, is such a friend of ours. He
               will tell thee at once what thou must do; and we will come to see
               thee, and will do aught that may be needful.  And Nello then
               joining them, they all three went home with <span class="person">Calandrino</span>, who, now
               quite spent, went straight to his room, and said to his wife: Come
               now, wrap me well up; I feel very ill.  And so he laid himself on
               the bed, and sent a maid with his water to Master Simone, who had
               then his shop in the <span class="place">Mercato Vecchio</span>, at the sign of the pumpkin.
               Whereupon quoth Bruno to his comrades: You will stay here
               with him, and I will go hear what the doctor has to say, and if need
               be, will bring him hither.  Prithee, do so, my friend, quoth
               <span class="person">Calandrino</span>, and bring me word how it is with me, for I feel as
               how I cannot say in my inside.  So Bruno hied him to Master
               Simone, and before the maid arrived with the water, told him what
               was afoot. The Master, thus primed, inspected the water, and then
               said to the maid: Go tell <span class="person">Calandrino</span> to keep himself very warm,
               and I will come at once, and let him know what is the matter with
               him, and what he must do.  With which message the maid was
               scarce returned, when the Master and Bruno arrived, and the Master,
               having seated himself beside <span class="person">Calandrino</span>, felt his pulse, and by and by,
               in the presence of his wife, said: Harkye, <span class="person">Calandrino</span>, I speak to
               thee as a friend, and I tell thee that what is amiss with thee is just
               that thou art with child.  Whereupon <span class="person">Calandrino</span> cried out querulously:
               Woe's me! 'Tis thy doing, Tessa, for that thou must
               needs be uppermost: I told thee plainly what would come of it.
               Whereat the lady, being not a little modest, coloured from brow to
               neck, and with downcast eyes, withdrew from the room, saying
               never a word by way of answer.  <span class="person">Calandrino</span> ran on in the same
               plaintive strain: Alas! woe's me! What shall I do? How shall
               I be delivered of this child? What passage can it find? Ah! I see
               only too plainly that the lasciviousness of this wife of mine has been
               the death of me: God make her as wretched as I would fain be
               happy!  Were I as well as I am not, I would get me up and thrash
               her, till I left not a whole bone in her body, albeit it does but serve
               me right for letting her get the upper place; but if I do win through
               this, she shall never have it again; verily she might pine to death for
               it, but she should not have it.
            </p>
            <p>Which to hear, Bruno and Buffalmacco and Nello were like to
               burst with suppressed laughter, and Master ScimmioneI.e.
               great
               ape: with a play on Simone. laughed so
               frantically, that all his teeth were ready to start from his jaws.  However,
               at length, in answer to <span class="person">Calandrino</span>'s appeals and entreaties for
               counsel and succour: <span class="person">Calandrino</span>, quoth the Master, thou
               mayst dismiss thy fears, for, God be praised, we were apprised of thy
               state in such good time that with but little trouble, in the course of a
               few days, I shall set thee right; but 'twill cost a little.  Woe's
               me, returned <span class="person">Calandrino</span>, be it so, Master, for the love of God:
               I have here two hundred pounds, with which I had thoughts of buying
               an estate: take them all, all, if you must have all, so only I may escape
               being delivered, for I know not how I should manage it, seeing that
               women, albeit 'tis much easier for them, do make such a noise in
               the hour of their labour, that I misdoubt me, if I suffered so, I should
               die before I was delivered.  Disquiet not thyself, said the
               doctor:
               I will have a potion distilled for thee; of rare virtue it is, and not
               a little palatable, and in the course of three days 'twill purge thee of
               all, and leave thee in better fettle than a fish; but thou wilt do well
               to be careful thereafter, and commit no such indiscretions again.
               Now to make this potion we must have three pair of good fat
               capons, and, for divers other ingredients, thou wilt give one of thy
               friends here five pounds in small change to purchase them, and thou
               wilt have everything sent to my shop, and so, please God, I will
               send thee this distilled potion to-morrow morning, and thou wilt
               take a good beakerful each time.  Whereupon: Be it as you
               bid, Master mine, quoth <span class="person">Calandrino</span>, and handing Bruno five
               pounds, and money enough to purchase three pair of capons, he
               begged him, if it were not too much trouble, to do him the service
               to buy these things for him.  So away went the doctor, and made a
               little decoction by way of draught, and sent it him. Bruno bought
               the capons and all else that was needed to furnish forth the feast,
               with which he and his comrades and the doctor regaled them.
               <span class="person">Calandrino</span> drank of the decoction for three mornings, after which
               he had a visit from his friends and the doctor, who felt his pulse, and
               then: Beyond a doubt, <span class="person">Calandrino</span>, quoth he, thou art cured,
               and so thou hast no more occasion to keep indoors, but needst have
               no fear to do whatever thou hast a mind to.  Much relieved,
               <span class="person">Calandrino</span> got up, and resumed his accustomed way of life, and,
               wherever he found any one to talk to, was loud in praise of
               Master Simone for the excellent manner in which he had cured
               him, causing him in three days without the least suffering to
               be quit of his pregnancy. And Bruno and Buffalmacco and
               Nello were not a little pleased with themselves that they had so
               cleverly got the better of <span class="person">Calandrino</span>'s niggardliness, albeit Monna
               Tessa, who was not deceived, murmured not a little against her
               husband.

               <p>Noble ladies, were it not
                  more difficult for men to evince their good sense and virtue than
                  their folly and their vice, many would labour in vain to set bounds
                  to their flow of words: whereof you have had a most conspicuous
                  example in poor blundering <span class="person">Calandrino</span>, who, for the better cure
                  of that with which in his simplicity he supposed himself to be
                  afflicted, had no sort of need to discover in public his wife's secret
                  pleasures.  Which affair has brought to my mind one that fell out
                  contrariwise, inasmuch as the guile of one discomfited the good
                  sense of another to the grievous loss and shame of the discomfited:
                  the manner whereof I am minded to relate to you.

            </div>
            <p>'Tis not many years since there were in <span class="place">Siena</span> two young men,
               both of age, and both alike named Cecco, the one being son of
               Messer Angiulieri, the other of Messer Fortarrigo. Who, albeit in
               many other respects their dispositions accorded ill, agreed so well in
               one, to wit, that they both hated their fathers, that they became
               friends, and kept much together.  Now Angiulieri, being a pretty
               fellow, and well-mannered, could not brook to live at <span class="place">Siena</span> on the
               allowance made him by his father, and learning that there was come
               into the March of <span class="place">Ancona</span>, as legate of the Pope, a cardinal, to whom
               he was much bounden, resolved to resort to him there, thinking thereby
               to improve his circumstances. So, having acquainted his father with
               his purpose, he prevailed upon him to give him there and then all that
               he would have given him during the next six months, that he might
               have the wherewith to furnish himself with apparel and a good mount,
               so as to travel in a becoming manner.  And as he was looking out for
               some one to attend him as his servant, Fortarrigo, hearing of it,
               came presently to him and besought him with all earnestness to take
               him with him as his groom, or servant, or what he would, and he
               would be satisfied with his keep, without any salary whatsoever.
               Whereto Angiulieri made answer that he was not disposed to take
               him, not but that he well knew that he was competent for any
               service that might be required of him, but because he was given to
               play, and therewithal would at times get drunk. Fortarrigo assured
               him with many an oath that he would be on his guard to commit
               neither fault, and added thereto such instant entreaties, that Angiulieri
               was, as it were, vanquished, and consented.  So one morning they
               took the road for <span class="place">Buonconvento</span>, being minded there to breakfast.
               Now when Angiulieri had breakfasted, as 'twas a very hot day, he
               had a bed made in the inn, and having undressed with Fortarrigo's
               help, he composed himself to sleep, telling Fortarrigo to call him on
               the stroke of none.  Angiulieri thus sleeping, Fortarrigo repaired to
               the tavern, where, having slaked his thirst, he sate down to a game
               with some that were there, who speedily won from him all his money,
               and thereafter in like manner all the clothes he had on his back:
               wherefore he, being anxious to retrieve his losses, went, stripped as
               he was to his shirt, to the room where lay Angiulieri; and seeing
               that he was sound asleep, he took from his purse all the money
               that he had, and so went back to the gaming-table, and staked it, and
               lost it all, as he had his own.
            </p>
            <p>By and by Angiulieri awoke, and got up, and dressed, and called
               for Fortarrigo; and as Fortarrigo answered not, he supposed that he
               must have had too much to drink, and be sleeping it off somewhere,
               as was his wont. He accordingly determined to leave him alone;
               and doubting not to find a better servant at <span class="place">Corsignano</span>, he let saddle
               his palfrey and attach the valise; but when, being about to depart,
               he would have paid the host, never a coin could he come by.  Whereat
               there was no small stir, so that all the inn was in an uproar, Angiulieri
               averring that he had been robbed in the house, and threatening
               to have them all arrested and taken to <span class="place">Siena</span>;  when, lo, who should
               make his appearance but Fortarrigo in his shirt, intent now to steal
               the clothes, as he had stolen the moneys, of Angiulieri? And marking
               that Angiulieri was accoutred for the road: How is this,
               Angiulieri? quoth he. Are we to start so soon? Nay, but wait
               a little. One will be here presently that has my doublet in pawn
               for thirty-eight soldi; I doubt not he will return it me for thirty-five
               soldi, if I pay money down.  And while they were yet talking,
               in came one that made it plain to Angiulieri that 'twas Fortarrigo
               that had robbed him of his money, for he told him the amount that
               Fortarrigo had lost. Whereat Angiulieri, in a towering passion,
               rated Fortarrigo right soundly, and, but that he stood more in fear of
               man than of God, would have suited action to word; and so,
               threatening to have him hanged by the neck and proclaimed an outlaw
               at the gallows-tree of <span class="place">Siena</span>, he mounted his horse.
            </p>
            <p>Fortarrigo, making as if 'twas not to him, but to another, that
               Angiulieri thus spoke, made answer: Come now, Angiulieri, we
               were best have done with all this idle talk, and consider the matter
               of substance: we can redeem for thirty-five soldi, if we pay forth-with,
               but if we wait till to-morrow, we shall not get off with less
               than thirty-eight, the full amount of the loan; and 'tis because I
               staked by his advice that he will make me this allowance. Now why
               should not we save these three soldi?  Whereat Angiulieri waxed
               well-nigh desperate, more particularly that he marked that the
               bystanders were scanning him suspiciously, as if, so far from understanding
               that Fortarrigo had staked and lost his, Angiulieri's money,
               they gave him credit for still being in funds: so he cried out:
               What have I to do with thy doublet? 'Tis high time thou wast
               hanged by the neck, that, not content with robbing me and gambling
               away my money, thou must needs also keep me in parley here and
               make mock of me, when I would fain be gone.  Fortarrigo, however,
               still persisted in making believe that Angiulieri did not mean
               this for him, and only said: Nay, but why wilt not thou save me
               these three soldi? Think'st thou I can be of no more use to thee?
               Prithee, an thou lov'st me, do me this turn. Wherefore in such a
               hurry? We have time enough to get to <span class="place">Torrenieri</span> this evening.
                Come now, out with thy purse. Thou knowest I might search <span class="place">Siena</span>
               through, and not find a doublet that would suit me so well as this:
               and for all I let him have it for thirty-eight soldi, 'tis worth forty or
               more; so thou wilt wrong me twice over. Vexed beyond measure
               that, after robbing him, Fortarrigo should now keep him clavering
               about the matter,  Angiulieri made no answer, but turned his horse's
               head, and took the road for <span class="place">Torrenieri</span>.  But Fortarrigo with cunning
               malice trotted after him in his shirt, and 'twas still his doublet, his
               doublet, that he would have of him: and when they had thus ridden
               two good miles, and Angiulieri was forcing the pace to get out of
               earshot of his pestering, Fortarrigo espied some husbandmen in a field
               beside the road a little ahead of Angiulieri, and fell a shouting to
               them amain: Take thief! take thief!  Whereupon they came
               up with their spades and their mattocks, and barred Angiulieri's way,
               supposing that he must have robbed the man that came shouting
               after him in his shirt, and stopped him and apprehended him; and
               little indeed did it avail him to tell them who he was, and how the
               matter stood.  For up came Fortarrigo with a wrathful air, and:
               I know not, quoth he, why I spare to kill thee on the spot,
               traitor, thief that thou art, thus to despoil me and give me the slip!
               And then, turning to the peasants: You see, gentlemen, quoth
               he, in what a trim he left me in the inn, after gambling away all
               that he had with him and on him. Well indeed may I say that
               under God 'tis to you I owe it that I have thus come by my own
               again: for which cause I shall ever be beholden to you.  Angiulieri
               also had his say; but his words passed unheeded. Fortarrigo with
               the help of the peasants compelled him to dismount; and having
               stripped him, donned his clothes, mounted his horse, and leaving him
               barefoot and in his shirt, rode back to <span class="place">Siena</span>, giving out on all hands
               that he had won the palfrey and the clothes from Angiulieri.  So
               Angiulieri, having thought to present himself to the cardinal in the
               March a wealthy man, returned to <span class="place">Buonconvento</span> poor and in his
               shirt; and being ashamed for the time to shew himself in <span class="place">Siena</span>,
               pledged the nag that Fortarrigo had ridden for a suit of clothes, and
               betook him to his kinsfolk at <span class="place">Corsignano</span>, where he tarried, until he
               received a fresh supply of money from his father.  Thus, then,
               Fortarrigo's guile disconcerted Angiulieri's judicious purpose, albeit
               when time and occasion served, it was not left unrequited.

            <p>Niccolò Cornacchini, one of our citizens, and a man of wealth,
               had among other estates a fine one at <span class="place">Camerata</span>, on which he had
               a grand house built, and engaged Bruno and Buffalmacco to paint it
               throughout; in which task, for that 'twas by no means light, they associated
               with them Nello and <span class="person">Calandrino</span>, and so set to work.  There
               were a few rooms in the house provided with beds and other furniture,
               and an old female servant lived there as caretaker, but otherwise
               the house was unoccupied, for which cause Niccolò's son, <span class="person">Filippo</span>,
               being
               a young man and a bachelor, was wont sometimes to bring thither a
               woman for his pleasure, and after keeping her there for a few days to
               escort her thence again.  Now on one of these occasions it befell
               that he brought thither one <span class="person">Niccolosa</span>, whom a vile fellow, named
               Mangione, kept in a house at <span class="place">Camaldoli</span> as a common prostitute.
               And a fine piece of flesh she was, and wore fine clothes, and, for
               one of her sort, knew how to comport herself becomingly and talk
               agreeably.
            </p>
            <p>Now one day at high noon forth tripped the damsel from her
               chamber in a white gown, her locks braided about her head, to
               wash her hands and face at a well that was in the courtyard of the
               house, and, while she was so engaged, it befell that <span class="person">Calandrino</span> came
               there for water, and greeted her familiarly.  Having returned his
               salutation, she, rather because <span class="person">Calandrino</span> struck her as something
               out of the common, than for any other interest she felt in him,
               regarded him attentively. <span class="person">Calandrino</span> did the like by her, and being
               smitten by her beauty, found reasons enough why he should not go
               back to his comrades with the water; but, as he knew not who she
               was, he made not bold to address her.  She, upon whom his gaze
               was not lost, being minded to amuse herself at his expense, let her
               glance from time to time rest upon him, while she heaved a slight
               sigh or two. Whereby <span class="person">Calandrino</span> was forthwith captivated, and
               tarried in the courtyard, until <span class="person">Filippo</span> called her back into the chamber.
               Returned to his work, <span class="person">Calandrino</span> sighed like a furnace: which
               Bruno, who was ever regardful of his doings for the diversion they
               afforded him, failed not to mark, and by and by: What the
               Devil is amiss with thee, comrade <span class="person">Calandrino</span>? quoth he. Thou
               dost nought but puff and blow.  Comrade, replied <span class="person">Calandrino</span>,
               I should be in luck, had I but one to help me. How so?
               quoth Bruno.  Why, returned <span class="person">Calandrino</span>, 'tis not to go farther,
               but there is a damsel below, fairer than a lamia, and so mightily in
               love with me that 'twould astonish thee. I observed it but now,
               when I went to fetch the water.  Nay, but, <span class="person">Calandrino</span>, make
               sure she be not <span class="person">Filippo</span>'s wife, quoth Bruno.  I doubt 'tis even
               so, replied <span class="person">Calandrino</span>, for he called her and she joined him in the
               chamber; but what signifies it? I would circumvent Christ Himself
               in such case, not to say <span class="person">Filippo</span>. Of a truth, comrade, I tell thee
               she pleases me I could not say how.  Comrade, returned Bruno,
               I will find out for thee who she is, and if she be <span class="person">Filippo</span>'s wife, two
               words from me will make it all straight for thee, for she is much my
               friend. But how shall we prevent Buffalmacco knowing it? I can
               never have a word with her, but he is with me.  As to Buffalmacco,
               replied <span class="person">Calandrino</span>, I care not if he do know it; but let
               us make sure that it come not to Nello's ears, for he is of kin to
               Monna Tessa, and would spoil it all.  Whereto: Thou art in
               the right, returned Bruno.
            </p>
            <p>Now Bruno knew what the damsel was, for he had seen her
               arrive, and moreover <span class="person">Filippo</span> had told him. So, <span class="person">Calandrino</span> having
               given over working for a while, and betaken him to her, Bruno
               acquainted Nello and Buffalmacco with the whole story; and thereupon
               they privily concerted how to entreat him in regard of this love
               affair.  Wherefore, upon his return, quoth Bruno softly: Didst
               see her?  Ay, woe's me! replied <span class="person">Calandrino</span>: she has
               stricken me to the death.  Quoth Bruno: I will go see if she
               be the lady I take her to be, and if I find that 'tis so, leave the
               rest to me.  Whereupon down went Bruno, and found <span class="person">Filippo</span> and
               the damsel, and fully apprised them what sort of fellow <span class="person">Calandrino</span>
               was, and what he had told them, and concerted with them what
               each should do and say, that they might have a merry time together
               	over <span class="person">Calandrino</span>'s love affair. He then rejoined <span class="person">Calandrino</span>, saying:
               'Tis the very same; and therefore the affair needs very delicate
               handling, for, if <span class="person">Filippo</span> were but ware thereof, not all <span class="place">Arno</span>'s waters
               would suffice to cleanse us. However, what should I say to her
               from thee, if by chance I should get speech of her?  I' faith,
               replied <span class="person">Calandrino</span>, why, first, first of all, thou wilt tell her that I
               wish her a thousand bushels of the good seed of generation, and then
               that I am her servant, and if she is fain of--aught--thou tak'st
               me?  Ay, quoth Bruno, leave it to me.
            </p>
            <p>Supper-time came; and, the day's work done, they went down
               into the courtyard, <span class="person">Filippo</span> and <span class="person">Niccolosa</span> being there, and there
               they tarried a while to advance <span class="person">Calandrino</span>'s suit. <span class="person">Calandrino</span>'s gaze
               was soon riveted on <span class="person">Niccolosa</span>, and such and so strange and startling
               were the gestures that he made that they would have given sight to
               the blind.  She on her part used all her arts to inflame his passion,
               primed as she had been by Bruno, and diverted beyond measure as
               she was by <span class="person">Calandrino</span>'s antics, while <span class="person">Filippo</span>, Buffalmacco and the
               rest feigned to be occupied in converse, and to see nought of what
               passed.  However, after a while, to <span class="person">Calandrino</span>'s extreme disgust, they
               took their leave; and as they bent their steps towards <span class="place">Florence</span>:
               I warrant thee, quoth Bruno to <span class="person">Calandrino</span>, she wastes away
               for thee like ice in the sunlight; by the body o' God, if thou
               wert to bring thy rebeck, and sing her one or two of thy love-songs,
               she'd throw herself out of window to be with thee.  Quoth <span class="person">Calandrino</span>:
               Think'st thou, comrade, think'st thou, 'twere well I
               brought it?  Ay, indeed, returned Bruno. 
               Whereupon:
               Ah! comrade, quoth <span class="person">Calandrino</span>, so thou wouldst not believe
               me when I told thee to-day? Of a truth I perceive there's ne'er
               another knows so well what he would be at as I.  Who but I
               would have known how so soon to win the love of a lady like that?
               Lucky indeed might they deem themselves, if they did it, those
               young gallants that go about, day and night, up and down, a strumming
               on the one-stringed viol, and would not know how to gather
               a handful of nuts once in a millennium. Mayst thou be by to see
               when I bring her the rebeck! thou wilt see fine sport.  List well
               what I say: I am not so old as I look; and she knows it right well:
               ay, and anyhow I will soon let her know it, when I come to grapple
               her. By the very body of Christ I will have such sport with her,
               that she will follow me as any love-sick maid follows her swain.
               Oh! quoth Bruno, I doubt not thou wilt make her thy prey:
               and I seem to see thee bite her dainty vermeil mouth and her cheeks,
               that shew as twin roses, with thy teeth, that are as so many lute-pegs,
               and afterwards devour her bodily.  So encouraged, <span class="person">Calandrino</span>
               fancied himself already in action, and went about singing and capering
               in such high glee that 'twas as if he would burst his skin.  And so
               next day he brought the rebeck, and to the no small amusement
               of all the company sang several songs to her. And, in short, by
               frequently seeing her, he waxed so mad with passion that he gave
               over working; and a thousand times a day he would run now to the
               window, now to the door, and anon to the courtyard on the chance
               of catching sight of her; nor did she, astutely following Bruno's
               instructions, fail to afford him abundance of opportunity.  Bruno
               played the go-between, bearing him her answers to all his messages,
               and sometimes bringing him messages from her. When she was not
               at home, which was most frequently the case, he would send him
               letters from her, in which she gave great encouragement to his hopes,
               at the same time giving him to understand that she was at the house
               of her kinsfolk, where as yet he might not visit her.
            </p>
            <p>On this wise Bruno and Buffalmacco so managed the affair as to
               divert themselves inordinately, causing him to send her, as at her
               request, now an ivory comb, now a purse, now a little knife, and
               other such dainty trifles; in return for which they brought him, now
               and again, a counterfeit ring of no value, with which <span class="person">Calandrino</span> was
               marvellously pleased. And <span class="person">Calandrino</span>, to stimulate their zeal in his
               interest, would entertain them hospitably at table, and otherwise
               flatter them.  Now, when they had thus kept him in play for two
               good months, and the affair was just where it had been, <span class="person">Calandrino</span>,
               seeing that the work was coming to an end, and bethinking him that,
               if it did so before he had brought his love affair to a successful issue,
               he must give up all hopes of ever so doing, began to be very instant
               and importunate with Bruno.  So, in the presence of the damsel, and
               by preconcert with her and <span class="person">Filippo</span>, quoth Bruno to <span class="person">Calandrino</span>:
               Harkye, comrade, this lady has vowed to me a thousand times that
               she will do as thou wouldst have her, and as, for all that, she does
               nought to pleasure thee, I am of opinion that she leads thee by the
               nose: wherefore, as she keeps not her promises, we will make her
               do so, willy-nilly, if thou art so minded.  Nay, but, for the love
               of God, so be it, replied <span class="person">Calandrino</span>, and that speedily.
               	Darest
               thou touch her, then, with a scroll that I shall give thee? quoth
               Bruno.  I dare, replied <span class="person">Calandrino</span>. 
               Fetch me, then, quoth
               Bruno, a bit of the skin of an unborn lamb, a live bat, three grains of
               incense, and a blessed candle; and leave the rest to me.  To catch
               the bat taxed all <span class="person">Calandrino</span>'s art and craft for the whole of the evening;
               but having at length taken him, he brought him with the other
               matters to Bruno: who, having withdrawn into a room by himself,
               wrote on the skin some cabalistic jargon, and handed it to him,
               saying:  Know, <span class="person">Calandrino</span>, that, if thou touch her with this
               scroll, she will follow thee forthwith, and do whatever thou shalt
               wish. Wherefore, should <span class="person">Filippo</span> go abroad to-day, get thee somehow
               up to her, and touch her; and then go into the barn that is
               hereby--'tis the best place we have, for never a soul goes there--and
               thou wilt see that she will come there too. When she is there, thou
               wottest well what to do.  <span class="person">Calandrino</span>, overjoyed as ne'er another,
               took the scroll, saying only: Comrade, leave that to me.
            </p>
            <p>Now Nello, whom <span class="person">Calandrino</span> mistrusted, entered with no less
               zest than the others into the affair, and was their confederate for
               <span class="person">Calandrino</span>'s discomfiture; accordingly by Bruno's direction he hied
               to <span class="place">Florence</span>, and finding Monna Tessa:  Thou hast scarce forgotten,
               Tessa, quoth he, what a beating <span class="person">Calandrino</span> gave thee,
               without the least cause, that day when he came home with the stones
               from <span class="place">Mugnone</span>; for which I would have thee be avenged, and, so
               thou wilt not, call me no more kinsman or friend. He is fallen in
               love with a lady up there, who is abandoned enough to go closeting
               herself not seldom with him, and 'tis but a short while since they
               made assignation to forgather forthwith: so I would have thee go
               there, and surprise him in the act, and give him a sound trouncing.
               Which when the lady heard, she deemed it no laughing matter; but
               started up and broke out with: Alas, the arrant knave! is't thus
               he treats me? By the Holy Rood, never fear but I will pay him
               out!  And wrapping herself in her cloak, and taking a young woman
               with her for companion, she sped more at a run than at a walk, escorted
               by Nello, up to <span class="place">Camerata</span>. Bruno, espying her from afar, said to
               <span class="person">Filippo</span>: Lo, here comes our friend.  Whereupon <span class="person">Filippo</span> went
               to the place where <span class="person">Calandrino</span> and the others were at work, and
               said: My masters, I must needs go at once to <span class="place">Florence</span>; slacken
               not on that account. And so off he went, and hid himself where,
               unobserved, he might see what <span class="person">Calandrino</span> would do.  <span class="person">Calandrino</span>
               waited only until he saw that <span class="person">Filippo</span> was at some distance, and then
               he went down into the courtyard, where he found <span class="person">Niccolosa</span> alone,
               and fell a talking with her. She, knowing well what she had to do,
               drew close to him, and shewed him a little more familiarity than she
               was wont: whereupon <span class="person">Calandrino</span> touched her with the scroll,  and
               having so done, saying never a word, bent his steps towards the
               barn, whither <span class="person">Niccolosa</span> followed him, and being entered, shut the
               door, and forthwith embraced him, threw him down on the straw
               that lay there, and got astride of him, and holding him fast by the
               arms about the shoulders, suffered him not to approach his face to
               hers, but gazing upon him, as if he were the delight of her heart:
               O <span class="person">Calandrino</span>, sweet my <span class="person">Calandrino</span>, quoth she, heart of my
               body, my very soul, my bliss, my consolation, ah! how long have I
               yearned to hold thee in my arms and have thee all my own! Thy
               endearing ways have utterly disarmed me; thou hast made prize of
               my heart with thy rebeck. Do I indeed hold thee in mine embrace?
               <span class="person">Calandrino</span>, scarce able to move, murmured: Ah! sweet
               my soul, suffer me to kiss thee.  Whereto: Nay, but thou art
               too hasty, replied <span class="person">Niccolosa</span>. Let me first feast mine eyes on
               thee; let me but sate them with this sweet face of thine.
            </p>
            <p>Meanwhile Bruno and Buffalmacco had joined <span class="person">Filippo</span>, so that
               what passed was seen and heard by all three. And while <span class="person">Calandrino</span>
               was thus intent to kiss <span class="person">Niccolosa</span>, lo, up came Nello with Monna
               Tessa. By God, I swear they are both there, ejaculated Nello,  as
               they entered the doorway; but the lady, now fairly furious, laid hold
               of him and thrust him aside, and rushing in, espied <span class="person">Niccolosa</span> astride
               of <span class="person">Calandrino</span>. <span class="person">Niccolosa</span> no sooner caught sight of the lady, than
               up she jumped, and in a trice was beside <span class="person">Filippo</span>.  Monna Tessa fell
               upon <span class="person">Calandrino</span>, who was still on the floor, planted her nails in his
               face, and scratched it all over: she then seized him by the hair, and
               haling him to and fro about the barn: Foul, pestilent cur, quoth
               she, is this the way thou treatest me? Thou old fool! A murrain
               on the love I have borne thee! Hast thou not enough to do at
               home, that thou must needs go falling in love with strange women?
               And a fine lover thou wouldst make! Dost not know thyself,
               knave? Dost not know thyself, wretch? Thou, from whose whole
               body 'twere not possible to wring enough sap for a sauce! God's
               faith, 'twas not Tessa that got thee with child: God's curse on her,
               whoever she was: verily she must be a poor creature to be enamoured
               of a jewel of thy rare quality.  At sight of his wife, <span class="person">Calandrino</span>,
               suspended, as it were, between life and death, ventured no defence; but,
               his face torn to shreds, his hair and clothes all disordered, fumbled about
               for his capuche, which having found, up he got, and humbly besought
               his wife not to publish the matter, unless she were minded that he
               should be cut to pieces, for that she that was with him was the wife
               of the master of the house. Then God give her a bad year,
               replied the lady.  Whereupon Bruno and Buffalmacco, who by this
               time had laughed their fill with <span class="person">Filippo</span> and <span class="person">Niccolosa</span>, came up as if
               attracted by the noise; and after not a little ado pacified the lady,
               and counselled <span class="person">Calandrino</span> to go back to <span class="place">Florence</span>, and stay there,
               lest <span class="person">Filippo</span> should get wind of the affair, and do him a mischief.
               So <span class="person">Calandrino</span>, crestfallen and woebegone, got him back to <span class="place">Florence</span>
               with his face torn to shreds; where, daring not to shew himself at
               <span class="place">Camerata</span> again, he endured day and night the grievous torment of
               his wife's vituperation. Such was the issue, to which, after ministering
               not a little mirth to his comrades, as also to <span class="person">Niccolosa</span> and <span class="person">Filippo</span>,
               this ardent lover brought his amour.

            <h3 style="text-align:center">Novel VI</h3>
            <p>Two young men lodge at an inn, of whom the one lies with

               with the other. He that lay with the daughter afterwards
               gets into her father's bed and tells him all,

                  company to laughter. However, when the ladies had done talking
                  of his doings, the queen called for a story from Pamfilo, who thus
                  spoke:

            </div>
            <div class="frame">
               <p>Worshipful ladies, this <span class="person">Niccolosa</span>, that <span class="person">Calandrino</span> loved,
                  has brought to my mind a story of another <span class="person">Niccolosa</span>; which I am
                  minded to tell you, because 'twill shew you how a good woman
                  by her quick apprehension avoided a great scandal.
               </p>
            </div>
            <p>In the plain of <span class="place">Mugnone</span> there was not long ago a good man that
               furnished travellers with meat and drink for money, and, for that he
               was in poor circumstances, and had but a little house, gave not lodging
               to every comer, but only to a few that he knew, and if they were
               hard bested.  Now the good man had to wife a very fine woman,
               and by her had two children, to wit, a pretty and winsome girl of
               some fifteen or sixteen summers, as yet unmarried, and a little
               boy, not yet one year old, whom the mother suckled at her own
               breast.  The girl had found favour in the eyes of a goodly and
               mannerly young gentleman of our city, who was not seldom in those
               parts, and loved her to the point of passion. And she, being mightily
               flattered to be loved by such a gallant, studied how to comport herself
               so
               debonairly as to retain his regard, and while she did so, grew
               likewise enamoured of him; and divers times, by consent of both
               their love had had its fruition, but that Pinuccio--such was the
               gallant's name--shrank from the disgrace that 'twould bring upon
               the girl and himself alike.  But, as his passion daily waxed apace,
               Pinuccio, yearning to find himself abed with her, bethought him that
               he were best contrive to lodge with her father, deeming, from what
               he knew of her father's economy, that, if he did so, he might effect
               his purpose, and never a soul be the wiser: which idea no sooner
               struck him, than he set about carrying it into effect.
            </p>
            <p>So, late one evening Pinuccio and a trusty comrade, <span class="person">Adriano</span> by
               name, to whom he had confided his love, hired two nags, and having
               set upon them two valises, filled with straw or such-like stuff, sallied
               forth of <span class="place">Florence</span>, and rode by a circuitous route to the plain of
               <span class="place">Mugnone</span>, which they reached after nightfall;  and having fetched a
               compass, so that it might seem as if they were coming from <span class="place">Romagna</span>,
               they rode up to the good man's house, and knocked at the door.
               The good man, knowing them both very well, opened to them forthwith:
               whereupon: Thou must even put us up to-night, quoth
               Pinuccio; we thought to get into <span class="place">Florence</span>, but, for all the speed
               we could make, we are but arrived here, as thou seest, at this hour.
               Pinuccio, replied the host, thou well knowest that I can but
               make a sorry shift to lodge gentlemen like you; but yet, as night
               has overtaken you here, and time serves not to betake you elsewhere,
               I will gladly give you such accommodation as I may.  The two
               gallants then dismounted and entered the inn, and having first looked
               to their horses, brought out some supper that they had carried with
               them, and supped with the host.
            </p>
            <p>Now the host had but one little bedroom, in which were three
               beds, set, as conveniently as he could contrive, two on one side of the
               room, and the third on the opposite side, but, for all that, there was
               scarce room enough to pass through.  The host had the least discomfortable
               of the three beds made up for the two friends; and having
               quartered them there, some little while afterwards, both being awake,
               but feigning to be asleep, he caused his daughter to get into one of
               the other two beds, while he and his wife took their places in the
               third, the good woman setting the cradle, in which was her little boy,
               beside the bed.  Such, then, being the partition made of the beds,
               Pinuccio,
               who had taken exact note thereof, waited only until he
               deemed all but himself to be asleep, and then got softly up and stole
               to the bed in which lay his beloved, and laid himself beside her; and
               she according him albeit a timorous yet a gladsome welcome, he
               stayed there, taking with her that solace of which both were most
               fain.
            </p>
            <p>Pinuccio being thus with the girl, it chanced that certain things,
               being overset by a cat, fell with a noise that aroused the good woman,
               who, fearing that it might be a matter of more consequence, got up
               as best she might in the dark, and betook her to the place whence the
               noise seemed to proceed.  At the same time <span class="person">Adriano</span>, not by reason
               of the noise, which he heeded not, but perchance to answer the call of
               nature, also got up, and questing about for a convenient place, came
               upon the cradle beside the good woman's bed; and not being able
               otherwise to go by, took it up, and set it beside his own bed, and
               when he had accomplished his purpose, went back, and giving never
               a thought to the cradle got him to bed.  The good woman searched
               until she found that the accident was no such matter as she had
               supposed; so without troubling to strike a light to investigate it
               further, she reproved the cat, and returned to the room, and groped
               her way straight to the bed in which her husband lay asleep; but not
               finding the cradle there, quoth she to herself: Alas! blunderer that
               I am, what was I about? God's faith! I was going straight to the
               guests' bed;  and proceeding a little further, she found the cradle, and
               laid herself down by <span class="person">Adriano</span> in the bed that was beside it, taking
               <span class="person">Adriano</span> for her husband; and <span class="person">Adriano</span>, who was still awake, received
               her with all due benignity, and tackled her more than once to her
               no small delight.
            </p>
            <p>Meanwhile Pinuccio fearing lest sleep should overtake him while
               he was yet with his mistress, and having satisfied his desire, got up
               and left her, to return to his bed; but when he got there, coming
               upon the cradle, he supposed that 'twas the host's bed; and so going
               a little further, he laid him down beside the host, who thereupon
               awoke.  Supposing that he had <span class="person">Adriano</span> beside him: I warrant
               thee, quoth Pinuccio to the host, there was never so sweet a piece
               of flesh as <span class="person">Niccolosa</span>: by the body of God, such delight have I had
               of her as never had man of woman; and, mark me, since I left thee,
               I have gotten me up to the farm some six times.  Which tidings the
               host being none too well pleased to learn, said first of all to
               himself: What the Devil does this fellow here? Then, his
               resentment getting the better of his prudence: 'Tis a gross affront
               thou hast put upon me, Pinuccio, quoth he; nor know I what
               occasion thou hast to do me such a wrong; but by the body of God
               I will pay thee out.  Pinuccio, who was not the most discreet of
               gallants, albeit he was now apprised of his error, instead of doing his
               best to repair it, retorted: And how wilt thou pay me out?
               What canst thou do?  Hark what high words our guests are at
               together! quoth meanwhile the host's wife to <span class="person">Adriano</span>, deeming
               that she spoke to her husband.  Let them be, replied <span class="person">Adriano</span>
               with a laugh: God give them a bad year: they drank too much
               yestereve.  The good woman had already half recognized her
               husband's angry tones, and now that she heard <span class="person">Adriano</span>'s voice, she
               at once knew where she was and with whom. Accordingly, being
               a discreet woman, she started up, and saying never a word, took her
               child's cradle, and, though there was not a ray of light in the room,
               bore it, divining rather than feeling her way, to the side of the bed
               in which her daughter slept;  and then, as if aroused by the noise
               made by her husband, she called him, and asked what he and
               Pinuccio were bandying words about. Hearest thou not, replied
               the husband, what he says he has this very night done to
               <span class="person">Niccolosa</span>? Tush! he lies in the throat,  returned the good
               woman: he has not lain with <span class="person">Niccolosa</span>; for what time he might
               have done so, I laid me beside her myself, and I have been wide
               awake ever since; and thou art a fool to believe him. You men
               take so many cups before going to bed that then you dream, and
               walk in your sleep, and imagine wonders. 'Tis a great pity you do
               not break your necks. What does Pinuccio there? Why keeps he
               not in his own bed?
            </p>
            <p> Whereupon <span class="person">Adriano</span>, in his turn, seeing how adroitly the good
               woman cloaked her own and her daughter's shame: Pinuccio,
               quoth he, I have told thee a hundred times, that thou shouldst not
               walk about at night; for this thy bad habit of getting up in thy
               dreams and relating thy dreams for truth will get thee into a scrape
               some time or another: come back, and God send thee a bad night.
               Hearing <span class="person">Adriano</span> thus confirm what his wife had said, the host began
               to think that Pinuccio must be really dreaming; so he took him by the
               shoulder, and fell a shaking him, and calling him by his name,
               saying: Pinuccio, wake up, and go back to thy bed.  Pinuccio,
               taking his cue from what he had heard, began as a dreamer would be
               like to do, to talk wanderingly; whereat the host laughed amain.
               Then, feigning to be aroused by the shaking, Pinuccio uttered
               <span class="person">Adriano</span>'s name, saying: Is't already day, that thou callest me?
               Ay, 'tis so, quoth <span class="person">Adriano</span>: come hither. 
               Whereupon Pinuccio,
               making as if he were mighty drowsy, got him up from beside the host,
               and back to bed with <span class="person">Adriano</span>. On the morrow, when they were
               risen, the host fell a laughing and making merry touching Pinuccio and
               his dreams.  And so the jest passed from mouth to mouth, while the
               gallants' horses were groomed and saddled, and their valises adjusted:
               which done, they drank with the host, mounted and rode to <span class="place">Florence</span>,
               no less pleased with the manner than with the matter of the night's
               adventure.  Nor, afterwards, did Pinuccio fail to find other means of
               meeting <span class="person">Niccolosa</span>, who assured her mother that he had unquestionably
               dreamed. For which cause the good woman, calling to mind
               <span class="person">Adriano</span>'s embrace, accounted herself the only one that had watched.

            <p>Talano di Molese dreams that a wolf tears and rends all
               the neck and face of his wife: he gives her warning
               thereof, which she heeds not, and the dream comes
               true.
            </p>
            <div class="frame">
               <p>When Pamfilo had brought his story to a close, and all had
                  commended
                  the good woman's quick perception, the queen bade <span class="person">Pampinea</span>
                  tell hers; and thus <span class="person">Pampinea</span> began:
               </p>
            </div>
            <div class="frame">
               <p>A while ago, debonair my
                  ladies, we held discourse of the truths that dreams shew forth, which
                  not a few of us deride; for which cause, albeit the topic has been
                  handled before, I shall not spare to tell you that which not long ago
                  befell a neighbour of mine, for that she disbelieved a dream that her
                  husband had.
               </p>
            </div>
            <p>I wot not if you knew Talano di Molese, a man right worthy to
               be had in honour; who, having married a young wife--Margarita
               by name--fair as e'er another, but without her match for whimsical,
               fractious, and perverse humours, insomuch that there was nought she
               would do at the instance of another, either for his or her own good,
               found her behaviour most grievous to bear, but was fain to endure
               what he might not cure.  Now it so befell that Talano and
               Margarita being together at an estate that Talano had in the contado,
               he, sleeping, saw in a dream a very beautiful wood that was on the
               estate at no great distance from the house, and his lady there walking.
               And as she went, there leapt forth upon her a huge and fierce wolf that
               griped her by the throat, and bore her down to the ground, and (she
               shrieking the while for succour) would have carried her off by main
               force; but she got quit of his jaws, albeit her neck and face shewed as
               quite disfigured.  On the morrow, as soon as he was risen, Talano said
               to
               his wife: Albeit for thy perversity I have not yet known a single
               good day with thee, yet I should be sorry, wife, that harm should
               befall thee; and therefore, if thou take my advice, thou wilt not stir
               out of doors to-day. Wherefore? quoth the lady; and thereupon
               he recounted to her all his dream.
            </p>
            <p>The lady shook her head, saying: Who means ill, dreams ill.
               Thou makest as if thou wast mighty tender of me, but thou bodest of
               me in thy dream that which thou wouldst fain see betide me. I
               warrant thee that to-day and all days I will have a care to avoid
               this or any other calamity that might gladden thy heart.  Whereupon:
               Well wist I, replied Talano, that thou wouldst so say,
               for such is ever the requital of those that comb scurfy heads; but
               whatever thou mayst be pleased to believe, I for my part speak to
               thee for thy good, and again I advise thee to keep indoors to-day, or
               at least not to walk in the wood.  Good, returned the lady, I
               will look to it, and then she began communing with herself on this
               wise: Didst mark how artfully he thinks to have scared me from
               going into the wood to-day? Doubtless 'tis that he has an assignation
               there with some light o' love, with whom he had rather I did not
               find him. Ah! he would sup well with the blind, and what a fool
               were I to believe him! But I warrant he will be disappointed, and
               needs must I, though I stay there all day long, see what commerce it
               is that he will adventure in to-day.
            </p>
            <p>Having so said, she quitted the house on one side, while her
               husband did so on the other; and forthwith, shunning observation as
               best she might, she hied her to the wood, and hid her where 'twas
               most dense, and there waited on the alert, and glancing, now this
               way and now that, to see if any were coming.  And while thus she
               stood, nor ever a thought of a wolf crossed her mind, lo, forth of
               a close covert hard by came a wolf of monstrous size and appalling
               aspect, and scarce had she time to say, God help me! before he sprang
               upon her and griped her by the throat so tightly that she might not
               utter a cry, but, passive as any lambkin, was borne off by him,  and
               had certainly been strangled, had he not encountered some shepherds,
               who with shouts compelled him to let her go. The shepherds
               recognized the poor hapless woman, and bore her home, where the
               physicians by dint of long and careful treatment cured her; howbeit
               the whole of her throat and part of her face remained so disfigured
               that,
               fair as she had been before, she was ever thereafter most foul
               and hideous to look upon.  Wherefore, being ashamed to shew her
               face, she did many a time bitterly deplore her perversity, in that, when
               it would have cost her nothing, she would nevertheless pay no heed
               to the true dream of her husband.

                  the stern vengeance taken by the scholar in <span class="person">Pampinea</span>'s narrative of
                  yesterday, I am minded to tell you of a vengeance that was indeed
                  less savage, but for all that grievous enough to him on whom it was
                  wreaked.
               </p>
            </div>
            <p>Wherefore I say that there was once at <span class="place">Florence</span> one that all
               folk called <span class="person">Ciacco</span>, a man second to none that ever lived for inordinate
               gluttony, who, lacking the means to support the expenditure
               which his gluttony demanded, and being, for the rest, well-mannered
               and well furnished with excellent and merry jests, did, without turning
               exactly court jester, cultivate a somewhat biting wit, and loved
               to frequent the houses of the rich, and such as kept good tables;
               whither, bidden or unbidden, he not seldom resorted for breakfast or
               supper.  There was also in those days at <span class="place">Florence</span> one that was called
               <span class="person">Biondello</span>, a man very short of stature, and not a little debonair, more
               trim than any fly, with his blond locks surmounted by a coif, and
               never a hair out of place; and he and <span class="person">Ciacco</span> were two of a trade.
            </p>
            <p>Now one morning in Lent <span class="person">Biondello</span>, being in the fish-market
               purchasing two mighty fat lampreys for Messer Vieri de' Cerchi, was
               observed
               thus engaged by <span class="person">Ciacco</span>, who came up to him, and:
               What means this? quoth he.  Why, replied <span class="person">Biondello</span>, 'tis
               that yestereve Messer Corso Donati had three lampreys much finer
               than these and a sturgeon sent to his house, but as they did not
               suffice for a breakfast that he is to give certain gentlemen, he has
               commissioned me to buy him these two beside. Wilt thou not be
               	there? Ay, marry, that will I, returned <span class="person">Ciacco</span>.  
               And in what
               he deemed due time he hied him to Messer Corso Donati's house, where
               he found him with some of his neighbours not yet gone to breakfast.
               And being asked by Messer Corso with what intent he was come,
               he answered: I am come, Sir, to breakfast with you and your
               company.  And welcome art thou, returned Messer Corso, go
               we then to breakfast, for 'tis now the time.  So to table they went,
               where nought was set before them but pease and the inward part of
               the tunny salted, and afterwards the common fish of the <span class="place">Arno</span> fried.
               Wherefore <span class="person">Ciacco</span>, not a little wroth at the trick that he perceived
               <span class="person">Biondello</span> had played him, resolved to pay him out. And not many
               days after <span class="person">Biondello</span>, who had meanwhile had many a laugh with his
               friends over <span class="person">Ciacco</span>'s discomfiture,  met him, and after greeting him,
               asked him with a laugh what Messer Corso's lampreys had been like.
               That question, replied <span class="person">Ciacco</span>, thou wilt be able to answer much
               better than I before eight days are gone by.  And parting from
               <span class="person">Biondello</span> upon the word, he went forthwith and hired a cozening
               rogue, and having thrust a glass bottle into his hand, brought him
               within sight of the <span class="place">Loggia de' Cavicciuli</span>; and there, pointing to a
               knight, one Messer <span class="person">Filippo</span> Argenti, a tall man and stout, and of
               a high courage, and haughty, choleric and cross-grained as ne'er
               another, he said to him:  Thou wilt go, flask in hand, to Messer
               <span class="person">Filippo</span>, and wilt say to him: 'I am sent to you, Sir, by <span class="person">Biondello</span>,
               who entreats you to be pleased to colour this flask for him with some
               of your good red wine, for that he is minded to have a good time with
               his catamites.' And of all things have a care that he lay not hands
               upon thee, for he would make thee rue the day, and would spoil my
               sport.  Have I aught else to say? enquired the rogue.
               Nothing
               more, returned <span class="person">Ciacco</span>: and now get thee gone, and when thou
               hast delivered the message, bring me back the flask, and I will pay
               thee.
            </p>
            <p>So away went the rogue, and did the errand to Messer <span class="person">Filippo</span>, who
               forthwith, being a hasty man, jumped to the conclusion that
               <span class="person">Biondello</span>, whom he knew, was making mock of him, and while an
               angry flush overspread his face: 'Colour the flask, forsooth!'
               quoth he, and 'Catamites!' God send thee and him a bad year!
               and therewith up he started, and reached forward to lay hold of the
               rogue,  who, being on the alert, gave him the slip and was off, and
               reported Messer <span class="person">Filippo</span>'s answer to <span class="person">Ciacco</span>, who had observed what
               had passed.  Having paid the rogue, <span class="person">Ciacco</span> rested not until he had
               found <span class="person">Biondello</span>, to whom: Wast thou but now, quoth he, at
               the <span class="place">Loggia de' Cavicciuli</span>?  Indeed no, replied <span class="person">Biondello</span>:
               wherefore
               such a question?  Because, returned <span class="person">Ciacco</span>, I may tell
               thee that thou art sought for by Messer <span class="person">Filippo</span>, for what cause I know
               not.  Good, quoth <span class="person">Biondello</span>, I will go thither and speak with
               him.  So away went <span class="person">Biondello</span>, and <span class="person">Ciacco</span> followed him to see
               what course the affair would take.
            </p>
            <p>Now having failed to catch the rogue, Messer <span class="person">Filippo</span> was still
               very wroth, and inly fumed and fretted, being unable to make out
               aught from what the rogue had said save that <span class="person">Biondello</span> was set on
               by some one or another to flout him. And while thus he vexed his
               spirit, up came <span class="person">Biondello</span>; whom he no sooner espied than he made
               for him, and dealt him a mighty blow in the face, and tore his hair
               and coif, and cast his capuche on the ground,  and to his Alas, Sir,
               what means this?  still beating him amain: Traitor, cried he; I
               will give thee to know what it means to send me such a message.
               'Colour the flask,' forsooth, and 'Catamites!' Dost take me for a
               stripling, to be befooled by thee?  And therewith he pummelled
               <span class="person">Biondello</span>'s face all over with a pair of fists that were liker to iron
               than aught else, until it was but a mass of bruises; he also tore and
               dishevelled all his hair, tumbled him in the mud, rent all his clothes
               upon his back, and that without allowing him breathing-space to ask
               why he thus used him, or so much as utter a word. Colour me
               the flask! and Catamites! rang in his ears;  but what the
               words signified he knew not.  In the end very badly beaten, and in
               very sorry and ragged trim, many folk having gathered around them,
               they, albeit not without the utmost difficulty, rescued him from
               Messer <span class="person">Filippo</span>'s hands, and told him why Messer <span class="person">Filippo</span> had thus
               used him, censuring him for sending him such a message, and adding
               that thenceforth he would know Messer <span class="person">Filippo</span> better, and that he was
               not a man to be trifled with.  <span class="person">Biondello</span> told them in tearful
               exculpation that he had never sent for wine to Messer <span class="person">Filippo</span>:
               then, when they had put him in a little better trim, crestfallen and
               woebegone, he went home imputing his misadventure to <span class="person">Ciacco</span>.
               And when, many days afterwards, the marks of his ill-usage being
               gone from his face, he began to go abroad again, it chanced that
               <span class="person">Ciacco</span> met him, and with a laugh: <span class="person">Biondello</span>, quoth he, how
               didst thou relish Messer <span class="person">Filippo</span>'s wine?  Why, as to that,
               replied <span class="person">Biondello</span>, would thou hadst relished the lampreys of Messer
               Corso as much!  So! returned <span class="person">Ciacco</span>, such meat as thou then
               gavest me, thou mayst henceforth give me, as often as thou art so
               minded; and I will give thee even such drink as I have given thee.
               So <span class="person">Biondello</span>, witting that against <span class="person">Ciacco</span> his might was not equal to
               his spite, prayed God for his peace, and was careful never to flout
               him again.

            <h3 style="text-align:center">Novel IX</h3>
            <p>Two young men ask counsel of Solomon; the one, how he
               is to make himself beloved, the other, how he is to reduce
               an unruly wife to order. The King bids the one to
               love, and the other to go to the <span class="place">Bridge of Geese</span>.
            </p>
            <div class="frame">
               <p>None now remained to tell save the queen, unless she were
                  minded to infringe <span class="person">Dioneo</span>'s privilege. Wherefore, when the ladies
                  had laughed their fill over the misfortunes of <span class="person">Biondello</span>, thus gaily
                  the queen began:
               </p>
            </div>
            <div class="frame">
               <p>Observe we, lovesome ladies, the order of things
                  with a sound mind, and we shall readily perceive that we women are
                  one and all subjected by Nature and custom and law unto man, by
                  him to be ruled and governed at his discretion; wherefore she, that
                  would fain enjoy quietude and solace and comfort with the man to
                  whom she belongs, ought not only to be chaste but lowly, patient
                  and obedient: the which is the discreet wife's chief and most precious
                  possession.  And if the laws, which in all matters have regard unto
                  the common weal, and use and wont or custom (call it what you
                  will), a power very great and to be had in awe, should not suffice to
                  school us thereto; yet abundantly clear is the witness of Nature,
                  which has fashioned our frames delicate and sensitive, and our spirits
                  timorous and fearful, and has decreed that our bodily strength shall
                  be slight, our voices tunable, and our movements graceful; which
                  qualities do all avouch that we have need of others' governance.
                  And whoso has need of succour and governance ought in all reason
                  to be obedient and submissive and reverent towards his governor.
                  And whom have we to govern and succour us save men? 'Tis then
                  our bounden duty to give men all honour and submit ourselves unto
                  them: from which rule if any deviate, I deem her most deserving
                  not only of grave censure but of severe chastisement.  Which
                  reflections,
                  albeit they are not new to me, I am now led to make by
                  what but a little while ago <span class="person">Pampinea</span> told us touching the perverse
                  wife of Talano, on whom God bestowed that chastisement which
                  the husband had omitted; and accordingly it jumps with my judgment
                  that all such women as deviate from the graciousness, kindliness
                  and compliancy, which Nature and custom and law prescribe, merit,
                  as I said, stern and severe chastisement.  Wherefore, as a salutary
                  medicine for the healing of those of us who may be afflicted with
                  this disease, I am minded to relate to you that which was once
                  delivered by Solomon by way of counsel in such a case. Which let
                  none that stands not in need of such physic deem to be meant for
                  her, albeit a proverb is current among men; to wit:
               </p>
               <p>	Good steed, bad steed, alike need the rowel's prick,
                  	Good wife, bad wife, alike demand the stick.
                  
               </p>
               <p>Which whoso should construe as a merry conceit would find you all
                  ready enough to acknowledge its truth. But even in its moral
                  significance I say that it ought to command assent.  For women are
                  all by nature apt to be swayed and to fall; and therefore, for the
                  correction of the wrong-doing of such as transgress the bounds
                  assigned to them, there is need of the stick punitive; and also for the
                  maintenance of virtue in others, that they transgress not these
                  appointed bounds, there is need of the stick auxiliary and deterrent.
                  However, to cut short this preachment, and to come to that which I
                  purpose to tell you, I say:
               </p>
            </div>
            <p>That the bruit of the incomparable renown of the prodigious
               wisdom of Solomon, as also of the exceeding great liberality with
               which he accorded proof thereof to all that craved such assurance,
               being gone forth over well-nigh all the earth, many from divers parts
               were wont to resort to him for counsel in matters of most pressing
               and arduous importance; among whom was a young man, <span class="person">Melisso</span>
               by name, a very wealthy nobleman, who was, as had been his fathers
               before him, of Lazistan, and there dwelt.  And as <span class="person">Melisso</span> fared
               toward <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>, on his departure from Antioch he fell in with
               another young man, <span class="person">Giosefo</span> by name, who was going the same way,
               and with whom, after the manner of travellers, he entered into converse.
               <span class="person">Melisso</span>, having learned from <span class="person">Giosefo</span>, who and whence he
               was, asked him whither he went, and on what errand: whereupon <span class="person">Giosefo</span>
               made an answer that he was going to seek counsel of Solomon,
               how he should deal with his wife, who had not her match among
               women for unruliness and perversity, insomuch that neither entreaties
               nor blandishments nor aught else availed him to bring her to a better
               frame. And thereupon he in like manner asked <span class="person">Melisso</span> whence he
               was, and whither he was bound, and on what errand:  whereto:
               Of Lazistan, I, replied <span class="person">Melisso</span>, and like thyself in evil plight;
               for albeit I am wealthy and spend my substance freely in hospitably
               entertaining and honourably entreating my fellow-citizens, yet for
               all that, passing strange though it be to think upon, I find never a
               soul to love me; and therefore I am bound to the self-same place as
               thou, to be advised how it may come to pass that I be beloved.
            </p>
            <p>So the two men fared on together, and being arrived at <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>,
               were, by the good offices of one of Solomon's barons, ushered
               into his presence, and <span class="person">Melisso</span> having briefly laid his case before the
               King, was answered in one word: Love.  Which said, <span class="person">Melisso</span>
               was forthwith dismissed, and <span class="person">Giosefo</span> discovered the reason of his
               coming. To whom Solomon made no answer but: Get thee
               to the <span class="place">Bridge of Geese</span>. Whereupon <span class="person">Giosefo</span> was likewise promptly
               ushered out of the King's presence, and finding <span class="person">Melisso</span> awaiting
               him, told him what manner of answer he had gotten.  Which
               utterances of the King the two men pondered, but finding therein
               nought that was helpful or relevant to their need, they doubted
               the King had but mocked them, and set forth upon their homeward
               journey.
            </p>
            <p>Now when they had been some days on the road, they came to
               a river, which was spanned by a fine bridge, and a great caravan of
               sumpter mules and horses being about to cross, they must needs
               tarry, until the caravan had passed by.  The more part of which
               had done so, when it chanced that a mule turned sulky, as we know
               they will not seldom do, and stood stock still; wherefore a muleteer
               took a stick and fell a beating the mule therewith, albeit at first with
               no great vigour, to urge the mule forward.  The mule, however,
               swerving, now to this, now to the other side of the bridge, and sometimes
               facing about, utterly refused to go forward. Whereat the
               muleteer, wroth beyond measure, fell a belabouring him with the stick
               now on the head, now on the flanks, and anon on the croup, never
               so lustily, but all to no purpose.  Which caused <span class="person">Melisso</span> and <span class="person">Giosefo</span>
               ofttimes
               to say to him: How now, caitiff? What is this thou
               doest? Wouldst kill the beast? Why not try if thou canst not
               manage him kindly and gently? He would start sooner so than for
               this cudgelling of thine.  To whom: You know your horses,
               replied the muleteer, and I know my mule: leave me to deal with
               him. Which said, he resumed his cudgelling of the mule, and laid
               about him on this side and on that to such purpose that he started
               him; and so the honours of the day rested with the muleteer.  Now,
               as the two young men were leaving the bridge behind them, <span class="person">Giosefo</span>
               asked a good man that sate at its head what the bridge was called,
               and was answered: Sir, 'tis called the <span class="place">Bridge of Geese</span>.  Which
               <span class="person">Giosefo</span> no sooner heard than he called to mind Solomon's words,
               and turning to <span class="person">Melisso</span>: Now, comrade, I warrant thee I may
               yet find Solomon's counsel sound and good, for that I knew not how
               to beat my wife is abundantly clear to me; and this muleteer has
               shewn me what I have to do.
            </p>
            <p>Now some days afterwards they arrived at Antioch, where
               <span class="person">Giosefo</span> prevailed upon <span class="person">Melisso</span> to tarry with him and rest a day or
               two; and meeting with but a sorry welcome on the part of his wife,
               he told her to take her orders as to supper from <span class="person">Melisso</span>, who, seeing
               that such was <span class="person">Giosefo</span>'s will, briefly gave her his instructions; which
               the lady, as had been her wont, not only did not obey, but contravened
               in almost every particular.  Which <span class="person">Giosefo</span> marking: Wast
               thou not told, quoth he angrily, after what fashion thou wast to
               order the supper?  Whereto: So! replied the lady haughtily:
               what means this? If thou hast a mind to sup, why take not thy
               supper? No matter what I was told, 'tis thus I saw fit to order it.
               If it like thee, so be it: if not, 'tis thine affair.  <span class="person">Melisso</span> heard the
               lady with surprise and inward disapprobation: <span class="person">Giosefo</span> retorted:
               Ay, wife, thou art still as thou wast used to be; but I will make
               thee mend thy manners. Then, turning to <span class="person">Melisso</span>: Friend,
               quoth he, thou wilt soon prove the worth of Solomon's counsel:
               but, prithee, let it not irk thee to look on, and deem that what I shall
               do is but done in sport; and if thou shouldst be disposed to stand in
               my way, bear in mind how we were answered by the muleteer,
               when we pitied his mule.  I am in thy house, replied <span class="person">Melisso</span>,
               and thy pleasure is to me law.
            </p>
            <p>Thereupon <span class="person">Giosefo</span> took a stout cudgel cut from an oak sapling, and
               hied him into the room whither the lady had withdrawn from
               the table in high dudgeon, seized her by the hair, threw her on to
               the floor at his feet, and fell a beating her amain with the cudgel.
               The lady at first uttered a shriek or two, from which she passed to
               threats; but seeing that, for all that, <span class="person">Giosefo</span> slackened not, by the
               time she was thoroughly well thrashed, she began to cry him mercy,
               imploring him not to kill her, and adding that henceforth his will
               should be to her for law.  But still <span class="person">Giosefo</span> gave not over, but with
               ever fresh fury dealt her mighty swingeing blows, now about the
               ribs, now on the haunches, now over the shoulders; nor had he
               done with the fair lady, until, in short, he had left never a bone or
               other part of her person whole, and he was fairly spent.  Then,
               returning to <span class="person">Melisso</span>: To-morrow, quoth he, we shall see
               whether 'Get thee to the <span class="place">Bridge of Geese</span>' will prove to have been
               sound advice or no. And so, having rested a while, and then washed
               his hands, he supped with <span class="person">Melisso</span>.  With great pain the poor lady
               got upon her feet and laid herself on her bed, and having there taken
               such rest as she might, rose betimes on the morrow, and craved to
               know of <span class="person">Giosefo</span> what he was minded to have to breakfast.  <span class="person">Giosefo</span>,
               laughing with <span class="person">Melisso</span> over the message, gave her his directions, and
               when in due time they came to breakfast, they found everything
               excellently ordered according as it had been commanded: for which
               cause the counsel, which they had at first failed to understand, now
               received their highest commendation.
            </p>
            <p>Some few days later <span class="person">Melisso</span>, having taken leave of <span class="person">Giosefo</span>,
               went home, and told a wise man the counsel he had gotten from
               Solomon. Whereupon: And no truer or sounder advice could
               he have given thee, quoth the sage: thou knowest that thou
               lovest never a soul, and that the honours thou payest and the services
               thou renderest to others are not prompted by love of them, but by
               love of display. Love, then, as Solomon bade thee, and thou shalt
               be loved.  On such wise was the unruly chastised; and the young
               man, learning to love, was beloved.

            </div>
            <p>A year or so ago there was at <span class="place">Barletta</span> a priest named Dom
               Gianni di Barolo, who, to eke out the scanty pittance his church
               afforded him, set a pack-saddle upon his mare, and took to going the
               round of the fairs of <span class="place">Apulia</span>, buying and selling merchandise.
               And so it befell that he clapped up a close acquaintance with one
               Pietro da <span class="place">Tresanti</span>, who plied the same trade as he, albeit instead of
               a mare he had but an ass; whom in token of friendship and goodfellowship
               Dom Gianni after the <span class="place">Apulia</span>n fashion called ever Gossip
               Pietro, and had him to his house and there lodged and honourably
               entreated him as often as he came to <span class="place">Barletta</span>.  Gossip Pietro on his
               part, albeit he was very poor and had but a little cot at <span class="place">Tresanti</span>
               that scarce sufficed for himself, his fair, young wife, and their ass,
               nevertheless, whenever Dom Gianni arrived at <span class="place">Tresanti</span>, made him
               welcome, and did him the honours of his house as best he might, in
               requital of the hospitality which he received at <span class="place">Barletta</span>.  However,
               as Gossip Pietro had but one little bed, in which he slept with his
               fair wife, 'twas not in his power to lodge Dom Gianni as comfortably
               as he would have liked; but the priest's mare being quartered beside
               the ass in a little stable, the priest himself must needs lie beside her
               on the straw.  Many a time when the priest came, the wife, knowing
               how honourably he entreated her husband at <span class="place">Barletta</span>, would
               fain have gone to sleep with a neighbour, one Zita <span class="person">Carapresa</span> di
               Giudice Leo, that the priest might share the bed with her husband,
               and many a time had she told the priest so: howbeit he would never
               agree to it,  and on one occasion: Gossip <span class="person">Gemmata</span>, quoth he,
               trouble not thyself about me; I am well lodged; for, when I am
               so minded, I turn the mare into a fine lass and dally with her, and
               then, when I would, I turn her back into a mare; wherefore I could
               ill brook to part from her.  The young woman, wondering but
               believing, told her husband what the priest had said, adding: If
               he is even such a friend as thou sayst, why dost thou not get him
               to teach thee the enchantment, so that thou mayst turn me into a
               mare, and have both ass and mare for thine occasions? We should
               then make twice as much gain as we do, and thou couldst turn me
               back into a woman when we came home at night.
            </p>
            <p>Gossip Pietro, whose wit was somewhat blunt, believed that 'twas
               as she said, approved her counsel, and began adjuring Dom Gianni,
               as persuasively as he might, to teach him the incantation. Dom
               Gianni did his best to wean him of his folly; but as all was in vain:
               Lo, now, quoth he, as you are both bent on it, we will be up,
               as is our wont, before the sun to-morrow morning, and I will shew you
               how 'tis done. The truth is that 'tis in the attachment of the
               tail that the great difficulty lies, as thou wilt see.  Scarce a wink of
               sleep had either Gossip Pietro or Gossip <span class="person">Gemmata</span> that night, so great
               was their anxiety; and towards daybreak up they got, and called
               Dom Gianni; who, being risen, came in his shirt into Gossip Pietro's
               little bedroom, and: I know not, quoth he, that there is
               another soul in the world for whom I would do this, save you, my
               gossips; however, as you will have it so, I will do it, but it behoves
               you to do exactly as I bid you, if you would have the enchantment
               work.  They promised obedience, and Dom Gianni thereupon took
               a light, which he handed to Gossip Pietro, saying: Let nought
               that I shall do or say escape thee; and have a care, so thou wouldst
               not ruin all, to say never a word, whatever thou mayst see or hear;
               and pray God that the tail may be securely attached.  So Gossip
               Pietro took the light, and again promised obedience;  Dom Gianni
               caused Gossip <span class="person">Gemmata</span> to strip herself stark naked, and stand on all
               fours like a mare, at the same time strictly charging her that, whatever
               might happen, she must utter no word. Then, touching her
               head and face: Be this a fine head of a mare, quoth he; in like
               manner touching her hair, he said: Be this a fine mane of a
               mare; touching her arms: Be these fine legs and fine hooves of
               a mare;  then, as he touched her breast and felt its firm roundness,
               and there awoke and arose one that was not called: And be this
               a fine breast of a mare, quoth he; and in like manner he dealt with
               her back, belly, croup, thighs, and legs. Last of all, the work being
               complete save for the tail, he lifted his shirt and took in his hand the
               tool with which he was used to plant men, and forthwith thrust it
               into the furrow made for it, saying: And be this a fine tail of a
               mare.  Whereat Gossip Pietro, who had followed everything very
               heedfully to that point, disapproving that last particular, exclaimed:
               No! Dom Gianni, I'll have no tail, I'll have no tail.  The
               essential juice, by which all plants are propagated, was already discharged,
               when Dom Gianni withdrew the tool, saying: Alas!
               Gossip Pietro, what hast thou done? Did I not tell thee to say never
               a word, no matter what thou mightst see? The mare was all but
               made; but by speaking thou hast spoiled all; and 'tis not possible to
               repeat the enchantment.  Well and good, replied Gossip Pietro,
               I would have none of that tail. Why saidst thou not to me: 'Make
               it thou'? And besides, thou wast attaching it too low.
               'Twas because, returned Dom Gianni, thou wouldst not have
               known, on the first essay, how to attach it so well as I.  Whereupon
               the young woman stood up, and in all good faith said to her
               husband: Fool that thou art, wherefore hast thou brought to
               nought what had been for the good of us both? When didst thou
               ever see mare without a tail? So help me God, poor as thou art,
               thou deservest to be poorer still.  So, after Gossip Pietro's ill-timed
               speech, there being no way left of turning the young woman into a
               mare, downcast and melancholy she resumed her clothes; and Gossip
               Pietro plied his old trade with his ass, and went with Dom Gianni
               to the fair of <span class="place">Bitonto</span>, and never asked him so to serve him again.

            <h3 class="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
            <p>What laughter this story drew from the ladies, who understood it
               better than <span class="person">Dioneo</span> had wished, may be left to the imagination of
               the fair one that now laughs thereat.  However, as the stories were
               ended, and the sun now shone with a tempered radiance, the queen,
               witting that the end of her sovereignty was come, stood up and took
               off the crown, and set it on the head of Pamfilo, whom alone it now
               remained thus to honour; and said with a smile: My lord, 'tis
               a great burden that falls upon thee, seeing that thou, coming last, art
               bound to make good my shortcomings and those of my predecessors;
               which God give thee grace to accomplish, even as He has given me
               grace to make thee king.  With gladsome acknowledgment of the
               honour: I doubt not, replied Pamfilo, that, thanks to your
               noble qualities and those of my other subjects, I shall win even such
               praise as those that have borne sway before me. Then, following
               the example of his predecessors, he made all meet arrangements in
               concert with the seneschal: after which, he turned to the expectant
               ladies, and thus spoke:  Enamoured my ladies, <span class="person">Emilia</span>, our queen
               of to-day, deeming it proper to allow you an interval of rest to recruit
               your powers, gave you license to discourse of such matters as should
               most commend themselves to each in turn; and as thereby you are
               now rested, I judge that 'tis meet to revert to our accustomed rule.
               Wherefore I ordain that for to-morrow you do each of you take
               thought how you may discourse of the ensuing theme: to wit, of
               such as in matters of love, or otherwise, have done something with
               liberality or magnificence.  By the telling, and (still more) by the
               doing of such things, your spirits will assuredly be duly attuned and
               animated
               to emprise high and noble; whereby our life, which cannot
               but be brief, seeing that 'tis enshrined in a mortal body, fame
               shall perpetuate in glory; which whoso serves not the belly, as do the
               beasts, must not only covet, but with all zeal seek after and labour to
               attain.
            </p>
            <p>The gay company having, one and all, approved the theme, rose
               at a word from their new king, and betook them to their wonted
               pastimes, and so, according as they severally had most lief, diverted
               them,  until they blithely reunited for supper, which being served
               with all due care and despatched, they rose up to dance, as they were
               wont, and when they had sung, perhaps, a thousand ditties, fitter to
               please by their words than by any excellence of musical art, the king
               bade <span class="person">Neifile</span> sing one on her own account. And promptly and
               graciously, with voice clear and blithe, thus <span class="person">Neifile</span> sang:
            </p>
            <div class="song">In prime of maidenhood, and fair and feat
               'Mid spring's fresh foison chant I merrily:
               Thanks be to Love and to my fancies sweet.As o'er the grassy mead I, glancing, fare,
               I mark it white and yellow and vermeil dight
               With flowers, the thorny rose, the lily white:
               And all alike to his face I compare,
               Who, loving, hath me ta'en, and me shall e'er
               Hold bounden to his will, sith I am she
               That in his will findeth her joy complete.Whereof if so it be that I do find

               That pluck I straight and kiss with words of love,
               Discovering all, as best I may, my mind;
               Yea, all my heart's desire; and then entwined
               I set it in the chaplet daintily,
               And with my yellow tresses bind and pleat.And as mine eyes do drink in the delight
               Which the flower yields them, even so my mind,
               Fired with his sweet love, doth such solace find,
               As he himself were present to the sight:
               But never word of mine discover might
               That which the flower's sweet smell awakes in me:
               Witness the true tale that my sighs repeat.For from my bosom gentle and hot they fly,
               Not like the gusty sighs that others heave,
               Whenas they languish and do sorely grieve;
               And to my love incontinent they hie:
               Whereof when he is ware, he, by and by,
               To meward hasting, cometh suddenly,
               When: Lest I faint, I cry, come, I entreat.
