            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>Dearest ladies, as well from what I heard in converse with the
               wise, as from matters that not seldom fell within my own observation
               and reading, I formed the opinion that the vehement and
               scorching blast of envy was apt to vent itself only upon lofty towers
               or the highest tree-tops: but therein I find that I misjudged; for,
               whereas I ever sought and studied how best to elude the buffetings
               of that furious hurricane, and to that end kept a course not merely
               on the plain, but, by preference, in the depth of the valley; as
               should be abundantly clear to whoso looks at these little stories,
               written as they are not only in the vulgar Florentine, and in prose,
               and without dedicatory flourish, but also in as homely and simple a
               style as may be; nevertheless all this has not stood me in such stead
               but that I have been shrewdly shaken, nay, all but uprooted by the
               blast, and altogether lacerated by the bite of this same envy.
               Whereby I may very well understand that 'tis true, what the sages
               aver, that only misery is exempt from envy in the present life.
               Know then, discreet my ladies, that some there are, who, reading
               these little stories, have alleged that I am too fond of you, and that
               'tis not a seemly thing that I should take so much pleasure in
               ministering to your gratification and solace; and some have found
               more fault with me for praising you as I do. Others, affecting to
               deliver a more considered judgment, have said that it ill befits my
               time of life to ensue such matters, to wit, the discoursing of women,
               or endeavouring to pleasure them. And not a few, feigning a mighty
               tender regard to my fame, aver that I should do more wisely to keep
               ever with the Muses on Parnassus, than to forgather with you in such
               vain dalliance. Those again there are, who, evincing less wisdom
               than despite, have told me that I should shew sounder sense if I
               bethought me how to get my daily bread, than, going after these idle
               toys, to nourish myself upon the wind; while certain others, in
               disparagement of my work, strive might and main to make it appear
               that the matters which I relate fell out otherwise than as I set them
               forth. Such then, noble ladies, are the blasts, such the sharp and
               cruel fangs, by which, while I champion your cause, I am assailed,
               harassed and well-nigh pierced through and through. Which
               censures I hear and mark, God knows, with equal mind: and,
               though to you belongs all my defence, yet I mean not to be niggard
               of my own powers, but rather, without dealing out to them the
               castigation they deserve, to give them such slight answer as may
               secure my ears some respite of their clamour; and that without
               delay; seeing that, if already, though I have not completed the
               third part of my work, they are not a few and very presumptuous, I
               deem it possible, that before I have reached the end, should they
               receive no check, they may have grown so numerous, that 'twould
               scarce tax their powers to sink me; and that your forces, great though
               they be, would not suffice to withstand them. However I am
               minded to answer none of them, until I have related in my behoof,
               not indeed an entire story, for I would not seem to foist my stories in
               among those of so honourable a company as that with which I have
               made you acquainted, but a part of one, that its very incompleteness
               may shew that it is not one of them: wherefore, addressing my
               assailants, I say: That in our city there was in old time a citizen
               named <span class="person">Filippo</span> Balducci, a man of quite low origin, but of good
               substance and well versed and expert in matters belonging to his
               condition, who had a wife that he most dearly loved, as did she him,
               so that their life passed in peace and concord, nor there was aught
               they studied so much as how to please each other perfectly. Now it
               came to pass, as it does to every one, that the good lady departed this
               life, leaving <span class="person">Filippo</span> nought of hers but an only son, that she had had
               by him, and who was then about two years old. His wife's death left
               <span class="person">Filippo</span> as disconsolate as ever was any man for the loss of a loved
               one: and sorely missing the companionship that was most dear to
               him, he resolved to have done with the world, and devote himself
               and his little son to the service of God. Wherefore, having dedicated
               all his goods to charitable uses, he forthwith betook him to the summit
               of <span class="place">Monte Asinaio</span>, where he installed himself with his son in a little
               cell, and living on alms, passed his days in fasting and prayer, being
               careful above all things to say nothing to the boy of any temporal
               matters, nor to let him see aught of the kind, lest they should
               distract his mind from his religious exercises, but discoursing with
               him continually of the glory of the life eternal and of God and the
               saints, and teaching him nought else but holy orisons: in which way
               of life he kept him not a few years, never suffering him to quit the
               cell or see aught but himself. From time to time the worthy man
               would go <span class="place">Florence</span>, where divers of the faithful would afford him
               relief according to his needs, and so he would return to his cell.
               And thus it fell out that one day <span class="person">Filippo</span>, now an aged man, being
               asked by the boy, who was about eighteen years old, whither he went,
               told him. Whereupon: Father, said the boy, you are now old,
               and scarce able to support fatigue; why take you me not with you
               for once to <span class="place">Florence</span>, and give me to know devout friends of God
               and you, so that I, who am young and fitter for such exertion than
               you, may thereafter go to <span class="place">Florence</span> for our supplies at your pleasure,
               and you remain here?
            </p>
            <p>The worthy man, bethinking him that his son was now grown
               up, and so habituated to the service of God as hardly to be seduced
               by the things of the world, said to himself: He says tell. And
               so, as he must needs go to <span class="place">Florence</span>, he took the boy with him.
               Where, seeing the palaces, the houses, the churches, and all matters
               else with which the city abounds, and of which he had no more
               recollection than if he had never seen them, the boy found all passing
               strange, and questioned his father of not a few of them, what they
               were and how they were named; his curiosity being no sooner
               satisfied in one particular than he plied his father with a further
               question. And so it befell that, while son and father were thus
               occupied in asking and answering questions, they encountered a bevy
               of damsels, fair and richly arrayed, being on their return from a
               wedding; whom the young man no sooner saw, than he asked his
               father what they might be. 
               My son, answered the father, fix
               thy gaze on the ground, regard them not at all, for naughty things
               are they. 
               Oh! said the son, and what is their name? 
               The
               father, fearing to awaken some mischievous craving of concupiscence
               in the young man, would not denote them truly, to wit, as women,
               but said: They are called goslings. 
               Whereupon, wonderful
               to tell! the lad who had never before set eyes on any woman,
               thought no more of the palaces, the oxen, the horses, the asses,
               the money, or aught else that he had seen, but exclaimed:
               Prithee, father, let me have one of those goslings. 
               Alas,
               my son, replied the father, speak not of them; they are
               naughty things. 
               Oh! questioned the son; but are naughty
               things made like that? 
               Ay, returned the father. 
               Whereupon
               the son: I know not, he said, what you say, nor why they
               should be naughty things: for my part I have as yet seen nought
               that seemed to me so fair and delectable. They are fairer than the
               painted angels that you have so often shewn me. Oh! if you love
               me, do but let us take one of these goslings up there, and I will see
               that she have whereon to bill. 
               Nay, said the father, that will
               not I. Thou knowest not whereon they bill; and straightway,
               being ware that nature was more potent than his art, he repented
               him that he had brought the boy to <span class="place">Florence</span>.
            </p>
            <p>But enough of this story: 'tis time for me to cut it short, and
               return to those, for whose instruction 'tis told. They say then,
               some of these my censors, that I am too fond of you, young ladies,
               and am at too great pains to pleasure you. Now that I am fond of
               you, and am at pains to pleasure you, I do most frankly and fully
               confess; and I ask them whether, considering only all that it means
               to have had, and to have continually, before one's eyes your debonair
               demeanour, your bewitching beauty and exquisite grace, and therewithal
               your modest womanliness, not to speak of having known the
               amorous kisses, the caressing embraces, the voluptuous comminglings,
               whereof our intercourse with you, ladies most sweet, not seldom is
               productive, they do verily marvel that I am fond of you, seeing that
               one who was nurtured, reared, and brought up on a savage and solitary
               mountain, within the narrow circuit of a cell, without other companion
               than his father, had no sooner seen you than 'twas you alone
               that he desired, that he demanded, that he sought with ardour?
               Will they tear, will they lacerate me with their censures, if I,
               whose body Heaven fashioned all apt for love, whose soul from
               very boyhood was dedicate to you, am not insensible to the power
               of the light of your eyes, to the sweetness of your honeyed words,
               to the flame that is kindled by your gentle sighs, but am fond of you
               and sedulous to pleasure you; you, again I bid them remember,
               in whom a hermit, a rude, witless lad, liker to an animal than to a
               human being, found more to delight him than in aught else that he
               saw? Of a truth whoso taxes me thus must be one that, feeling,
               knowing nought of the pleasure and power of natural affection, loves
               you not, nor craves your love; and such an one I hold in light esteem.
               And as for those that go about to find ground of exception in my
               age, they do but shew that they ill understand that the leek, albeit
               its head is white, has a green tail. But jesting apart, thus I answer
               them, that never to the end of my life shall I deem it shameful to
               me to pleasure those to whom Guido Cavalcanti and Dante Alighieri
               in their old age, and Messer Cino da <span class="place">Pistoia</span> in extreme old age,
               accounted it an honour and found it a delight to minister gratification.
               And but that 'twere a deviation from the use and wont of
               discourse, I would call history to my aid, and shew it to abound
               with stories of noble men of old time, who in their ripest age studied
               above all things else to pleasure the ladies; whereof if they be
               ignorant, go they and get them to school. To keep with the Muses
               on Parnassus is counsel I approve; but tarry with them always we
               cannot, nor they with us, nor is a man blameworthy, if, when he
               happen to part from them, he find his delight in those that resemble
               them. The Muses are ladies, and albeit ladies are not the peers of
               the Muses, yet they have their outward semblance; for which cause,
               if for no other, 'tis reasonable that I should be fond of them.
               Besides which, ladies have been to me the occasion of composing
               some thousand verses, but of never a verse that I made were the
               Muses the occasion. Howbeit 'twas with their aid, 'twas under their
               influence that I composed those thousand verses, and perchance they
               have sometimes visited me to encourage me in my present task, humble
               indeed though it be, doing honour and paying, as it were, tribute,
               to the likeness which the ladies have to them; wherefore, while I
               weave these stories, I stray not so far from Mount Parnassus and the
               Muses as not a few perchance suppose. But what shall we say to
               those, in whom my hunger excites such commiseration that they
               bid me get me bread? Verily I know not, save this: Suppose that
               in my need I were to beg bread of them, what would be their
               answer? I doubt not they would say: Go seek it among the
               fables. 
               And in sooth the poets have found more bread among their
               fables than many rich men among their treasures. And many that
               have gone after fables have crowned their days with splendour, while,
               on the other hand, not a few, in the endeavour to get them more
               bread than they needed, have perished miserably. But why waste
               more words on them? Let them send me packing, when I ask
               bread of them; not that, thank God, I have yet need of it, and
               should I ever come to be in need of it, I know, like the Apostle,
               how to abound and to be in want, and so am minded to be beholden
               to none but myself. As for those who say that these matters fell out
               otherwise than as I relate them, I should account it no small favour,
               if they would produce the originals, and should what I write not
               accord with them, I would acknowledge the justice of their censure,
               and study to amend my ways; but, until better evidence is forthcoming
               than their words, I shall adhere to my own opinion without
               seeking to deprive them of theirs, and give them tit for tat. And
               being minded that for this while this answer suffice, I say that with
               God and you, in whom I trust, most gentle ladies, to aid and protect
               me, and patience for my stay, I shall go forward with my work,
               turning my back on this tempest, however it may rage; for I see
               not that I can fare worse than the fine dust, which the blast of the
               whirlwind either leaves where it lies, or bears aloft, not seldom over
               the heads of men, over the crowns of kings, of emperors, and sometimes
               suffers to settle on the roofs of lofty palaces, and the summits
               of the tallest towers, whence if it fall, it cannot sink lower than the
               level from which it was raised. And if I ever devoted myself and
               all my powers to minister in any wise to your gratification, I am
               now minded more than ever so to do, because I know that there is
               nought that any can justly say in regard thereof, but that I, and
               others who love you, follow the promptings of nature, whose laws
               whoso would withstand, has need of powers pre-eminent, and, even
               so, will oft-times labour not merely in vain but to his own most
               grievous disadvantage. Such powers I own that I neither have, nor,
               to such end, desire to have; and had I them, I would rather leave
               them to another than use them myself. Wherefore let my detractors
               hold their peace, and if they cannot get heat, why, let them shiver
               their life away; and, while they remain addicted to their delights,
               or rather corrupt tastes, let them leave me to follow my own bent
               during the brief life that is accorded us. But this has been a long
               digression, fair ladies, and 'tis time to retrace our steps to the point
               where we deviated, and continue in the course on which we started.

            <p>The sun had chased every star from the sky, and lifted the dank
               murk of night from the earth, when, <span class="person">Filostrato</span> being risen, and
               having roused all his company, they hied them to the fair garden,
               and there fell to disporting themselves: the time for breakfast being
               come, they took it where they had supped on the preceding evening,
               and after they had slept they rose, when the sun was in his zenith,
               and seated themselves in their wonted manner by the beautiful
               fountain; where <span class="person">Fiammetta</span>, being bidden by <span class="person">Filostrato</span> to lead off
               the story-telling, awaited no second command, but debonairly thus
               began.

               <p>A direful theme has our king allotted us for to-day's discourse;
                  seeing that, whereas we are here met for our common delectation,
                  needs must we now tell of others' tears, whereby, whether telling
                  or hearing, we cannot but be moved to pity. Perchance 'twas to
                  temper in some degree the gaiety of the past days that he so
                  ordained, but, whatever may have been his intent, his will must be
                  to me immutable law; wherefore I will narrate to you a matter that
                  befell piteously, nay woefully, and so as you may well weep thereat.
               </p>
            </div>
            <p>Tancred, Prince of <span class="place">Salerno</span>, a lord most humane and kind of heart,
               but that in his old age he imbrued his hands in the blood of a lover,
               had in the whole course of his life but one daughter; and had he not
               had her, he had been more fortunate.
            </p>
            <p>Never was daughter more tenderly beloved of father than she of
               the Prince, who, for that cause not knowing how to part with her,
               kept her unmarried for many a year after she had come of marriageable
               age: then at last he gave her to a son of the Duke of <span class="place">Capua</span>,
               with whom she had lived but a short while, when he died and she
               returned to her father. Most lovely was she of form and feature
               (never woman more so), and young and light of heart, and more
               knowing, perchance, than beseemed a woman. Dwelling thus with
               her loving father, as a great lady, in no small luxury, nor failing to
               see that the Prince, for the great love he bore her, was at no pains to
               provide her with another husband, and deeming it unseemly on her
               part to ask one of him, she cast about how she might come by a
               gallant to be her secret lover. And seeing at her father's court not
               a few men, both gentle and simple, that resorted thither, as we know
               men use to frequent courts, and closely scanning their mien and
               manners, she preferred before all others the Prince's page, <span class="person">Guiscardo</span>
               by name, a man of very humble origin, but pre-eminent for native
               worth and noble bearing; of whom, seeing him frequently, she
               became hotly enamoured, hourly extolling his qualities more and
               more highly. The young man, who for all his youth by no means
               lacked shrewdness, read her heart, and gave her his own on such
               wise that his love for her engrossed his mind to the exclusion of
               almost everything else. While thus they burned in secret for one
               another, the lady, desiring of all things a meeting with <span class="person">Guiscardo</span>,
               but being shy of making any her confidant, hit upon a novel
               expedient to concert the affair with him. She wrote him a letter
               containing her commands for the ensuing day, and thrust it into a
               cane in the space between two of the knots, which cane she gave to
               <span class="person">Guiscardo</span>, saying: Thou canst let thy servant have it for a
               bellows to blow thy fire up to night. 
               <span class="person">Guiscardo</span> took it, and
               feeling sure that 'twas not unadvisedly that she made him such a
               present, accompanied with such words, hied him straight home,
               where, carefully examining the cane, he observed that it was cleft,
               and, opening it, found the letter; which he had no sooner read, and
               learned what he was to do, than, pleased as ne'er another, he fell to
               devising how to set all in order that he might not fail to meet the
               lady on the following day, after the manner she had prescribed.
            </p>
            <p>Now hard by the Prince's palace was a grotto, hewn in days of
               old in the solid rock, and now long disused, so that an artificial
               orifice, by which it received a little light, was all but choked with
               brambles and plants that grew about and overspread it. From one
               of the ground-floor rooms of the palace, which room was part of the
               lady's suite, a secret stair led to the grotto, though the entrance was
               barred by a very strong door. This stair, having been from time
               immemorial disused, had passed out of mind so completely that there
               was scarce any that remembered that it was there: but Love, whose
               eyes nothing, however secret, may escape, had brought it to the mind
               of the enamoured lady. For many a day, using all secrecy, that
               none should discover her, she had wrought with her tools, until she had
               succeeded in opening the door; which done, she had gone down
               into the grotto alone, and having observed the orifice, had by her
               letter apprised <span class="person">Guiscardo</span> of its apparent height above the floor of
               the grotto, and bidden him contrive some means of descending
               thereby. Eager to carry the affair through, <span class="person">Guiscardo</span> lost no time
               in rigging up a ladder of ropes, whereby he might ascend and
               descend; and having put on a suit of leather to protect him from
               the brambles, he hied him the following night (keeping the affair
               close from all) to the orifice, made the ladder fast by one of its ends
               to a massive trunk that was rooted in the mouth of the orifice,
               climbed down the ladder, and awaited the lady. On the morrow,
               making as if she would fain sleep, the lady dismissed her damsels,
               and locked herself into her room: she then opened the door of the
               grotto, hied her down, and met <span class="person">Guiscardo</span>, to their marvellous
               mutual satisfaction. The lovers then repaired to her room, where
               in exceeding great joyance they spent no small part of the day. 
               Nor
               were they neglectful of the precautions needful to prevent discovery
               of their amour; but in due time <span class="person">Guiscardo</span> returned to the grotto;
               whereupon the lady locked the door and rejoined her damsels. At
               nightfall <span class="person">Guiscardo</span> reascended his ladder, and, issuing forth of the
               orifice, hied him home; nor, knowing now the way, did he fail to
               revisit the grotto many a time thereafter.
            </p>
            <p>But Fortune, noting with envious eye a happiness of such degree
               and duration, gave to events a dolorous turn, whereby the joy of the
               two lovers was converted into bitter lamentation. 'Twas Tancred's
               custom to come from time to time quite alone to his daughter's
               room, and tarry talking with her a while. Whereby it so befell that
               he came down there one day after breakfast, while Ghismonda--such
               was the lady's name--was in her garden with her damsels; so that
               none saw or heard him enter; nor would he call his daughter, for he
               was minded that she should not forgo her pleasure. But, finding the
               windows closed and the bed-curtains drawn down, he seated himself
               on a divan that stood at one of the corners of the bed, rested his head
               on the bed, drew the curtain over him, and thus, hidden as if of set
               purpose, fell asleep. As he slept Ghismonda, who, as it happened,
               had caused <span class="person">Guiscardo</span> to come that day, left her damsels in the garden,
               softly entered the room, and having locked herself in, unwitting
               that there was another in the room, opened the door to <span class="person">Guiscardo</span>,
               who was in waiting. Straightway they got them to bed, as was
               their wont; and, while they there solaced and disported them
               together, it so befell that Tancred awoke, and heard and saw what
               they did: whereat he was troubled beyond measure, and at first was
               minded to upbraid them; but on second thoughts he deemed it best
               to hold his peace, and avoid discovery, if so he might with greater
               stealth and less dishonour carry out the design which was already in
               his mind. The two lovers continued long together, as they were
               wont, all unwitting of Tancred; but at length they saw fit to get
               out of bed, when <span class="person">Guiscardo</span> went back to the grotto, and the lady
               hied her forth of the room. Whereupon Tancred, old though he
               was, got out at one of the windows, clambered down into the garden,
               and, seen by none, returned sorely troubled to his room. By his
               command two men took <span class="person">Guiscardo</span> early that same night, as he
               issued forth of the orifice accoutred in his suit of leather, and brought
               him privily to Tancred; who, as he saw him, all but wept, and
               said: <span class="person">Guiscardo</span>, my kindness to thee is ill requited by the outrage
               and dishonour which thou hast done me in the person of my daughter,
               as to-day I have seen with my own eyes. 
               To whom <span class="person">Guiscardo</span>
               could answer nought but: Love is more potent than either you
               or I. 
               Tancred then gave order to keep him privily under watch
               and ward in a room within the palace; and so 'twas done. 
               Next
               day, while Ghismonda wotted nought of these matters, Tancred,
               after pondering divers novel expedients, hied him after breakfast,
               according to his wont, to his daughter's room, where, having called
               her to him and locked himself in with her, he began, not without
               tears, to speak on this wise: 
               Ghismonda, conceiving that I knew
               thy virtue and honour, never, though it had been reported to me,
               would I have credited, had I not seen with my own eyes, that thou
               wouldst so much as in idea, not to say fact, have ever yielded thyself
               to any man but thy husband: wherefore, for the brief residue of life
               that my age has in store for me, the memory of thy fall will ever be
               grievous to me. And would to God, as thou must needs demean
               thyself to such dishonour, thou hadst taken a man that matched thy
               nobility; but of all the men that frequent my court, thou must needs
               choose <span class="person">Guiscardo</span>, a young man of the lowest condition, a fellow
               whom we brought up in charity from his tender years; for whose
               sake thou hast plunged me into the abyss of mental tribulation,
               insomuch that I know not what course to take in regard of thee.
               As to <span class="person">Guiscardo</span>, whom I caused to be arrested last night as he
               issued from the orifice, and keep in durance, my course is already
               taken, but how I am to deal with thee, God knows, I know not. 
               I
               am distraught between the love which I have ever borne thee, love
               such as no father ever bare to daughter, and the most just indignation
               evoked in me by thy signal folly; my love prompts me to pardon
               thee, my indignation bids me harden my heart against thee, though
               I do violence to my nature. But before I decide upon my course,
               I would fain hear what thou hast to say to this. So saying, he
               bent his head, and wept as bitterly as any child that had been
               soundly thrashed.
            </p>
            <p>Her father's words, and the tidings they conveyed that not only
               was her secret passion discovered, but <span class="person">Guiscardo</span> taken, caused
               Ghismonda immeasurable grief, which she was again and again on
               the point of evincing, as most women do, by cries and tears; but
               her high spirit triumphed over this weakness; by a prodigious effort
               she composed her countenance, and taking it for granted that her
               <span class="person">Guiscardo</span> was no more, she inly devoted herself to death rather than
               a single prayer for herself should escape her lips. 
               Wherefore, not as
               a woman stricken with grief or chidden for a fault, but unconcerned
               and unabashed, with tearless eyes, and frank and utterly dauntless
               mien, thus answered she her father: Tancred, your accusation
               I shall not deny, neither will I cry you mercy, for nought should
               I gain by denial, nor aught would I gain by supplication: nay more;
               there is nought I will do to conciliate thy humanity and love; my
               only care is to confess the truth, to defend my honour by words of
               sound reason, and then by deeds most resolute to give effect to the
               promptings of my high soul. 
               True it is that I have loved and love
               <span class="person">Guiscardo</span>, and during the brief while I have yet to live shall love
               him, nor after death, so there be then love, shall I cease to love him;
               but that I love him, is not imputable to my womanly frailty so
               much as to the little zeal thou shewedst for my bestowal in marriage,
               and to <span class="person">Guiscardo</span>'s own worth. It should not have escaped thee,
               Tancred, creature of flesh and blood as thou art, that thy daughter
               was also a creature of flesh and blood, and not of stone or iron; it
               was, and is, thy duty to bear in mind (old though thou art) the
               nature and the might of the laws to which youth is subject; and,
               though thou hast spent part of thy best years in martial exercises,
               thou shouldst nevertheless have not been ignorant how potent is the
               influence even upon the aged--to say nothing of the young--of ease
               and luxury. And not only am I, as being thy daughter, a creature
               of flesh and blood, but my life is not so far spent but that I am still
               young, and thus doubly fraught with fleshly appetite, the vehemence
               whereof is marvellously enhanced by reason that, having been married,
               I have known the pleasure that ensues upon the satisfaction of such
               desire. Which forces being powerless to withstand, I did but act
               as was natural in a young woman, when I gave way to them, and
               yielded myself to love. Nor in sooth did I fail to the utmost of my
               power so to order the indulgence of my natural propensity that my
               sin should bring shame neither upon thee nor upon me. To which
               end Love in his pity, and Fortune in a friendly mood, found and
               discovered to me a secret way, whereby, none witting, I attained my
               desire: this, from whomsoever thou hast learned it, howsoever thou
               comest to know it, I deny not. 'Twas not at random, as many
               women do, that I loved <span class="person">Guiscardo</span>; but by deliberate choice I preferred
               him before all other men, and of determinate forethought I
               lured him to my love, whereof, through his and my discretion and
               constancy, I have long had joyance. Wherein 'twould seem that
               thou, following rather the opinion of the vulgar than the dictates of
               truth, find cause to chide me more severely than in my sinful love,
               for, as if thou wouldst not have been vexed, had my choice fallen on
               a nobleman, thou complainest that I have forgathered with a man of
               low condition; and dost not see that therein thou censurest not my
               fault but that of Fortune, which not seldom raises the unworthy to
               high place and leaves the worthiest in low estate. But leave we
               this: consider a little the principles of things: thou seest that in
               regard of our flesh we are all moulded of the same substance, and
               that all souls are endowed by one and the same Creator with equal
               faculties, equal powers, equal virtues. 'Twas merit that made the
               first distinction between us, born as we were, nay, as we are, all
               equal, and those whose merits were and were approved in act the
               greatest were called noble, and the rest were not so denoted. Which
               law, albeit overlaid by the contrary usage of after times, is not yet
               abrogated, nor so impaired but that it is still traceable in nature and
               good manners; for which cause whoso with merit acts, does plainly
               shew himself a gentleman; and if any denote him otherwise, the
               default is his own and not his whom he so denotes. Pass in review
               all thy nobles, weigh their merits, their manners and bearing, and then
               compare <span class="person">Guiscardo</span>'s qualities with theirs: if thou wilt judge without
               prejudice, thou wilt pronounce him noble in the highest degree, and
               thy nobles one and all churls. As to <span class="person">Guiscardo</span>'s merits and worth I
               did but trust the verdict which thou thyself didst utter in words, and
               which mine own eyes confirmed. Of whom had he such commendation
               as of thee for all those excellences whereby a good man and true
               merits commendation? And in sooth thou didst him but justice;
               for, unless mine eyes have played me false, there was nought for
               which thou didst commend him but I had seen him practise it, and
               that more admirably than words of thine might express; and had I
               been at all deceived in this matter, 'twould have been by thee. Wilt
               thou say then that I have forgathered with a man of low condition?
               If so, thou wilt not say true. Didst thou say with a poor man, the
               impeachment might be allowed, to thy shame, that thou so ill hast
               known how to requite a good man and true that is thy servant; but
               poverty, though it take away all else, deprives no man of gentilesse.
               Many kings, many great princes, were once poor, and many a ditcher
               or herdsman has been and is very wealthy. As for thy last perpended
               doubt, to wit, how thou shouldst deal with me, banish it
               utterly from thy thoughts. If in thy extreme old age thou art
               minded to manifest a harshness unwonted in thy youth, wreak thy
               harshness on me, resolved as I am to cry thee no mercy, prime cause
               as I am that this sin, if sin it be, has been committed; for of this I
               warrant thee, that as thou mayst have done or shalt do to <span class="person">Guiscardo</span>,
               if to me thou do not the like, I with my own hands will do it. Now
               get thee gone to shed thy tears with the women, and when thy
               melting mood is over, ruthlessly destroy <span class="person">Guiscardo</span> and me, if such
               thou deem our merited doom, by one and the same blow.
            </p>
            <p>The loftiness of his daughter's spirit was not unknown to the
               Prince; but still he did not credit her with a resolve quite as firmly
               fixed as her words implied, to carry their purport into effect. So,
               parting from her without the least intention of using harshness
               towards her in her own person, he determined to quench the heat of
               her love by wreaking his vengeance on her lover, and bade the two
               men that had charge of <span class="person">Guiscardo</span> to strangle him noiselessly that
               same night, take the heart out of the body, and send it to him. 
               The
               men did his bidding: and on the morrow the Prince had a large and
               beautiful cup of gold brought to him, and having put <span class="person">Guiscardo</span>'s
               heart therein, sent it by the hand of one of his most trusted servants
               to his daughter, charging the servant to say, as he gave it to her:
               Thy father sends thee this to give thee joy of that which thou
               lovest best, even as thou hast given him joy of that which he loved
               best.
            </p>
            <p>Now when her father had left her, Ghismonda, wavering not
               a jot in her stern resolve, had sent for poisonous herbs and roots, and
               therefrom had distilled a water, to have it ready for use, if that which
               she apprehended should come to pass. And when the servant
               appeared with the Prince's present and message, she took the cup
               unblenchingly, and having lifted the lid, and seen the heart, and
               apprehended the meaning of the words, and that the heart was
               beyond a doubt <span class="person">Guiscardo</span>'s, she raised her head, and looking straight
               at the servant, said: Sepulture less honourable than of gold had
               ill befitted heart such as this: herein has my father done wisely.
               Which said, she raised it to her lips, and kissed it, saying: In all
               things and at all times, even to this last hour of my life, have I
               found my father most tender in his love, but now more so than
               ever before; wherefore I now render him the last thanks which will
               ever be due from me to him for this goodly present. 
               So she spoke,
               and straining the cup to her, bowed her head over it, and gazing at
               the heart, said: Ah! sojourn most sweet of all my joys, accursed
               be he by whose ruthless act I see thee with the bodily eye: 'twas
               enough that to the mind's eye thou wert hourly present. 
               Thou
               hast run thy course; thou hast closed the span that Fortune allotted
               thee; thou hast reached the goal of all; thou hast left behind thee
               the woes and weariness of the world; and thy enemy has himself
               granted thee sepulture accordant with thy deserts. 
               No circumstance
               was wanting to duly celebrate thy obsequies, save the tears of her
               whom, while thou livedst, thou didst so dearly love; which that
               thou shouldst not lack, my remorseless father was prompted of God
               to send thee to me, and, albeit my resolve was fixed to die with eyes
               unmoistened and front all unperturbed by fear, yet will I accord
               thee my tears; which done, my care shall be forthwith by thy
               means to join my soul to that most precious soul which thou didst
               once enshrine. 
               And is there other company than hers, in which
               with more of joy and peace I might fare to the abodes unknown?
               She is yet here within, I doubt not, contemplating the abodes of her
               and my delights, and--for sure I am that she loves me--awaiting my
               soul that loves her before all else.
            </p>
            <p>Having thus spoken, she bowed herself low over the cup; and,
               while no womanish cry escaped her, 'twas as if a fountain of water
               were unloosed within her head, so wondrous a flood of tears gushed
               from her eyes, while times without number she kissed the dead
               heart. Her damsels that stood around her knew not whose the
               heart might be or what her words might mean, but melting in sympathy,
               they all wept, and compassionately, as vainly, enquired the
               cause of her lamentation, and in many other ways sought to comfort
               her to the best of their understanding and power. 
               When she had
               wept her fill, she raised her head, and dried her eyes. Then: O
               heart, said she, much cherished heart, discharged is my every duty
               towards thee; nought now remains for me to do but to come and
               unite my soul with thine. 
               So saying, she sent for the vase that
               held the water which the day before she had distilled, and emptied
               it into the cup where lay the heart bathed in her tears; then, nowise
               afraid, she set her mouth to the cup, and drained it dry, and so with
               the cup in her hand she got her upon her bed, and having there disposed
               her person in guise as seemly as she might, laid her dead lover's heart
               upon her own, and silently awaited death. 
               Meanwhile the damsels,
               seeing and hearing what passed, but knowing not what the water
               was that she had drunk, had sent word of each particular to Tancred;
               who, apprehensive of that which came to pass, came down with all
               haste to his daughter's room, where he arrived just as she got her
               upon her bed, and, now too late, addressed himself to comfort her
               with soft words, and seeing in what plight she was, burst into a flood
               of bitter tears. To whom the lady: Reserve thy tears, Tancred,
               till Fortune send thee hap less longed for than this: waste them not
               on me who care not for them. Whoever yet saw any but thee
               bewail the consummation of his desire? But, if of the love thou
               once didst bear me any spark still lives in thee, be it thy parting
               grace to me, that, as thou brookedst not that I should live with
               <span class="person">Guiscardo</span> in privity and seclusion, so wherever thou mayst have
               caused <span class="person">Guiscardo</span>'s body to be cast, mine may be united with it in the
               common view of all. 
               The Prince replied not for excess of grief;
               and the lady, feeling that her end was come, strained the dead heart
               to her bosom, saying: Fare ye well; I take my leave of you;
               and with eyelids drooped and every sense evanished departed this
               life of woe. 
               Such was the lamentable end of the loves of <span class="person">Guiscardo</span>
               and Ghismonda; whom Tancred, tardily repentant of his harshness,
               mourned not a little, as did also all the folk of <span class="place">Salerno</span>, and had
               honourably interred side by side in the same tomb.

               <p>'Tis a proverb current among the vulgar, that: Whoso, being
                  wicked, is righteous reputed, May sin as he will, and 'twill ne'er be
                  imputed. Which proverb furnishes me with abundant matter of
                  discourse, germane to our theme, besides occasion to exhibit the
                  quality and degree of the hypocrisy of the religious, who flaunt it in
                  ample flowing robes, and, with faces made pallid by art, with voices
                  low and gentle to beg alms, most loud and haughty to reprove in
                  others their own sins, would make believe that their way of salvation
                  lies in taking from us and ours in giving to them; nay, more, as if
                  they had not like us Paradise to win, but were already its lords and
                  masters, assign therein to each that dies a place more or less exalted
                  according to the amount of the money that he has bequeathed to
                  them; which if they believe, 'tis by dint of self-delusion, and to the
                  effect of deluding all that put faith in their words. 
                  Of whose guile
                  were it lawful for me to make as full exposure as were fitting, not a
                  few simple folk should soon be enlightened as to what they cloak
                  within the folds of their voluminous habits. But would to God all
                  might have the like reward of their lies as a certain friar minor, no
                  novice, but one that was reputed among their greatestde' maggior
                  cassesi. No such word as cassesi is known to the lexicographers
                  or commentators; and no plausible emendation has yet been
                  suggested. at <span class="place">Venice</span>;
                  whose story, rather than aught else, I am minded to tell you, if so
                  I may, perchance, by laughter and jollity relieve in some degree your
                  souls that are heavy laden with pity for the death of Ghismonda.

            </div>
            <p>Know then, noble ladies, that there was in <span class="place">Imola</span> a man of evil
               and corrupt life, Berto della Massa by name, whose pestilent practices
               came at length to be so well known to the good folk of <span class="place">Imola</span> that
               'twas all one whether he lied or spoke the truth, for there was not a
               soul in <span class="place">Imola</span> that believed a word he said: wherefore, seeing that his
               tricks would pass no longer there, he removed, as in despair, to <span class="place">Venice</span>,
               that common sink of all abominations, thinking there to find other
               means than he had found elsewhere to the prosecution of his nefarious
               designs. And, as if conscience-stricken for his past misdeeds, he
               assumed an air of the deepest humility, turned the best Catholic of
               them all, and went and made himself a friar minor, taking the name
               of Fra Alberto da <span class="place">Imola</span>. With his habit he put on a shew of
               austerity, highly commending penitence and abstinence, and eating
               or drinking no sort of meat or wine but such as was to his taste.
               
               And scarce a soul was there that wist that the thief, the pimp,
               the cheat, the assassin, had not been suddenly converted into a great
               preacher without continuing in the practice of the said iniquities,
               whensoever the same was privily possible. And withal, having got
               himself made priest, as often as he celebrated at the altar, he would
               weep over the passion of our Lord, so there were folk in plenty to
               see, for tears cost him little enough, when he had a mind to shed
               them. In short, what with his sermons and his tears, he duped the
               folk of <span class="place">Venice</span> to such a tune that scarce a will was there made but
               he was its executor and depositary; nay, not a few made him trustee
               of their moneys, and most, or well-nigh most, men and women alike,
               their confessor and counsellor: in short, he had put off the wolf and
               put on the shepherd, and the fame of his holiness was such in those
               parts that St. Francis himself had never the like at Assisi.
            </p>
            <p>Now it so befell that among the ladies that came to confess to this
               holy friar was one Monna Lisetta of Ca' Quirino, the young, silly,
               empty-headed wife of a great merchant, who was gone with the
               galleys to <span class="place">Flanders</span>. Like a Venetian--for unstable are they all--though
               she placed herself at his feet, she told him but a part of her
               sins, and when Fra Alberto asked her whether she had a lover, 
               she
               replied with black looks: How now, master friar? have you not
               eyes in your head? See you no difference between my charms and
               those of other women? Lovers in plenty might I have, so I would:
               but charms such as mine must not be cheapened: 'tis not every man
               that might presume to love me. How many ladies have you seen
               whose beauty is comparable to mine? I should adorn Paradise
               itself. Whereto she added so much more in praise of her beauty
               that the friar could scarce hear her with patience. 
               Howbeit, discerning
               at a glance that she was none too well furnished with sense,
               he deemed the soil meet for his plough, and fell forthwith inordinately
               in love with her, though he deferred his blandishments to a more
               convenient season, and by way of supporting his character for holiness
               began instead to chide her, telling her (among other novelties) that
               this was vainglory: whereto the lady retorted that he was a blockhead,
               and could not distinguish one degree of beauty from another.
               Wherefore Fra Alberto, lest he should occasion her too much chagrin,
               cut short the confession, and suffered her to depart with the other
               ladies. 
               Some days after, accompanied by a single trusty friend, he
               hied him to Monna Lisetta's house, and having withdrawn with her
               alone into a saloon, where they were safe from observation, he fell on
               his knees at her feet, and said: Madam, for the love of God I
               crave your pardon of that which I said to you on Sunday, when you
               spoke to me of your beauty, for so grievously was I chastised therefor
               that very night, that 'tis but to-day that I have been able to quit
               my bed. 
               And by whom, quoth my Lady Battledore, were
               you so chastised? 
               I will tell you, returned Fra Alberto.
               That night I was, as is ever my wont, at my orisons, when suddenly
               a great light shone in my cell, and before I could turn me
               to see what it was, I saw standing over me a right goodly youth with
               a stout cudgel in his hand, who seized me by the habit and threw
               me at his feet and belaboured me till I was bruised from head to
               foot. And when I asked him why he used me thus, he answered:
               --''Tis because thou didst to-day presume to speak slightingly of
               the celestial charms of Monna Lisetta, whom I love next to God
               Himself.' Whereupon I asked: 'And who are you?' And he
               made answer that he was the Angel Gabriel. Then said I: 'O
               my lord, I pray you pardon me.' Whereto he answered: 'I pardon
               thee on condition that thou go to her, with what speed thou mayst,
               and obtain her pardon, which if she accord thee not, I shall come
               back hither and give thee belabourings enough with my cudgel to
               make thee a sad man for the rest of thy days.' What more he
               said, I dare not tell you, unless you first pardon me. 
               Whereat our
               flimsy pumpion-pated Lady Lackbrain was overjoyed, taking all the
               friar's words for gospel. So after a while she said: And did I not
               tell you, Fra Alberto, that my charms were celestial? But, so help
               me God, I am moved to pity of you, and forthwith I pardon you,
               lest worse should befall you, so only you tell me what more the
               Angel said. 
               So will I gladly, Madam, returned Fra Alberto,
               now that I have your pardon; this only I bid you bear in mind,
               that you have a care that never a soul in the world hear from you a
               single word of what I shall say to you, if you would not spoil your
               good fortune, wherein there is not to-day in the whole world a lady
               that may compare with you. Know then that the Angel Gabriel
               bade me tell you that you stand so high in his favour that again and
               again he would have come to pass the night with you, but that he
               doubted he should affright you. So now he sends you word through
               me that he would fain come one night, and stay a while with you;
               and seeing that, being an angel, if he should visit you in his angelic
               shape, he might not be touched by you, he would, to pleasure you,
               present himself in human shape; and so he bids you send him word,
               when you would have him come, and in whose shape, and he will
               come; for which cause you may deem yourself more blessed than
               any other lady that lives. 
               My Lady Vanity then said that she
               was highly flattered to be beloved of the Angel Gabriel; whom she
               herself loved so well that she had never grudged four soldi to burn
               a candle before his picture, wherever she saw it, and that he was
               welcome to visit her as often as he liked, and would always find her
               alone in her room; on the understanding, however, that he should
               not desert her for the Virgin Mary, whom she had heard he did
               mightily affect, and indeed 'twould so appear, for, wherever she saw
               him, he was always on his knees at her feet: for the rest he might
               even come in what shape he pleased, so that it was not such as to
               terrify her. Then said Fra Alberto: Madam, 'tis wisely spoken;
               and I will arrange it all with him just as you say. But 'tis in your
               power to do me a great favour, which will cost you nothing; and
               this favour is that you be consenting that he visit you in my
               shape. Now hear wherein you will confer this favour: thus will it
               be: he will disembody my soul, and set it in Paradise, entering himself
               into my body; and, as long as he shall be with you, my soul will
               be in Paradise. 
               Whereto my Lady Slenderwit: So be it, she
               said; I am well pleased that you have this solace to salve the bruises
               that he gives you on my account. 
               Good, said Fra Alberto;
               then you will see to it that to-night he find, when he comes, your
               outer door unlatched, that he may have ingress; for, coming, as he
               will, in human shape, he will not be able to enter save by the door.
               It shall be done, replied the lady. Whereupon Fra Alberto took
               his leave, and the lady remained in such a state of exaltation that her
               nether end knew not her chemise, and it seemed to her a thousand
               years until the Angel Gabriel should come to visit her. 
               Fra
               Alberto, bethinking him that 'twas not as an angel, but as a cavalier
               that he must acquit himself that night, fell to fortifying himself with
               comfits and other dainties, that he might not lose his saddle for
               slight cause. Then, leave of absence gotten, he betook him at nightfall,
               with a single companion, to the house of a woman that was his
               friend, which house had served on former occasions as his base when
               he went a chasing the fillies; and having there disguised himself,
               he hied him, when he deemed 'twas time, to the house of the lady,
               where, donning the gewgaws he had brought with him, he transformed
               himself into an angel, and going up, entered the lady's
               chamber. No sooner saw she this dazzling apparition than she fell
               on her knees before the Angel, who gave her his blessing, raised her
               to her feet, and motioned her to go to bed. She, nothing loath,
               obeyed forthwith, and the Angel lay down beside his devotee. 
               Now
               Fra Alberto was a stout, handsome fellow, whose legs bore themselves
               right bravely; and being bedded with Monna Lisetta, who was lusty
               and delicate, he covered her after another fashion than her husband
               had been wont, and took many a flight that night without wings, so
               that she heartily cried him content; and not a little therewithal did
               he tell her of the glory celestial. Then towards daybreak, all being
               ready for his return, he hied him forth, and repaired, caparisoned as
               he was, to his friend, whom, lest he should be affrighted, sleeping
               alone, the good woman of the house had solaced with her company.
               The lady, so soon as she had breakfasted, betook her to Fra Alberto,
               and reported the Angel Gabriel's visit, and what he had told her of
               the glory of the life eternal, describing his appearance, not without
               some added marvels of her own invention. 
               Whereto Fra Alberto
               replied: Madam, I know not how you fared with him; but this
               I know, that last night he came to me, and for that I had done his
               errand with you, he suddenly transported my soul among such a
               multitude of flowers and roses as was never seen here below, and my
               soul--what became of my body I know not--tarried in one of the
               most delightful places that ever was from that hour until matins.
               As for your body, said the lady, do I not tell you whose it was?
               It lay all night long with the Angel Gabriel in my arms; and if you
               believe me not, you have but to look under your left pap, where I
               gave the Angel a mighty kiss, of which the mark will last for some
               days. 
               Why then, said Fra Alberto, I will even do to-day
               what 'tis long since I did, to wit, undress, that I may see if you say
               sooth. 
               So they fooled it a long while, and then the lady went
               home, where Fra Alberto afterwards paid her many a visit without
               any let. 
               However, one day it so befell that while Monna Lisetta
               was with one of her gossips canvassing beauties, she, being minded
               to exalt her own charms above all others, and having, as we know,
               none too much wit in her pumpion-pate, observed: Did you but
               know by whom my charms are prized, then, for sure, you would
               have nought to say of the rest. 
               Her gossip, all agog to hear, for
               well she knew her foible, answered: Madam, it may be as you say,
               but still, while one knows not who he may be, one cannot alter one's
               mind so rapidly. 
               Whereupon my Lady Featherbrain: Gossip,
               said she, 'tis not for common talk, but he that I wot of is the
               Angel Gabriel, who loves me more dearly than himself, for that I
               am, so he tells me, the fairest lady in all the world, ay, and in the
               <span class="place">Maremma</span> to boot.With this ineptitude cf. the friar's flowers
               and roses on the preceding
               page. 
               Whereat her gossip would fain have laughed,
               but held herself in, being minded to hear more from her. Wherefore
               she said: God's faith, Madam, if 'tis the Angel Gabriel, and
               he tells you so, why, so of course it must needs be; but I wist
               not the angels meddled with such matters. 
               There you erred,
               gossip, said the lady: zounds, he does it better than my husband,
               and he tells me they do it above there too, but, as he rates my
               charms above any that are in heaven, he is enamoured of me, and
               not seldom visits me: so now dost see? 
               So away went the gossip
               so agog to tell the story, that it seemed to her a thousand years till
               she was where it might be done; and being met for recreation with
               a great company of ladies, she narrated it all in detail: whereby it
               passed to the ladies' husbands, and to other ladies, and from them to
               yet other ladies, so that in less than two days all <span class="place">Venice</span> was full of
               it. But among others, whose ears it reached, were Monna Lisetta's
               brothers-in-law, who, keeping their own counsel, resolved to find
               this angel and make out whether he knew how to fly; to which end
               they kept watch for some nights. 
               Whereof no hint, as it happened,
               reached Fra Alberto's ears; and so, one night when he was come to
               enjoy the lady once more, he was scarce undressed when her brothers-in-law,
               who had seen him come, were at the door of the room and
               already opening it, when Fra Alberto, hearing the noise and apprehending
               the danger, started up, and having no other resource, threw open
               a window that looked on to the Grand Canal, and plunged into the
               water. The depth was great, and he was an expert swimmer; so
               that he took no hurt, but, having reached the other bank, found a
               house open, and forthwith entered it, praying the good man that was
               within, for God's sake to save his life, and trumping up a story to
               account for his being there at so late an hour, and stripped to the
               skin. The good man took pity on him, and having occasion to go
               out, he put him in his own bed, bidding him stay there until his
               return; and so, having locked him in, he went about his business.
            </p>
            <p>Now when the lady's brothers-in-law entered the room, and found
               that the Angel Gabriel had taken flight, leaving his wings behind him,
               being baulked of their prey, they roundly rated the lady, and then,
               leaving her disconsolate, betook themselves home with the Angel's
               spoils. Whereby it befell, that, when 'twas broad day, the good man,
               being on the <span class="place">Rialto</span>, heard tell how the Angel Gabriel had come to
               pass the night with Monna Lisetta, and, being surprised by her
               brothers-in-law, had taken fright, and thrown himself into the Canal,
               and none knew what was become of him. The good man guessed
               in a trice that the said Angel was no other than the man he had at
               home, whom on his return he recognized, and, after much chaffering,
               brought him to promise him fifty ducats that he might not be given
               up to the lady's brothers-in-law. The bargain struck, Fra Alberto
               signified a desire to be going. Whereupon: There is no way,
               said the good man, but one, if you are minded to take it. To-day
               we hold a revel, wherein folk lead others about in various disguises;
               as, one man will present a bear, another a wild man, and so forth;
               and then in the piazza of <span class="place">San Marco</span> there is a hunt, which done, the
               revel is ended; and then away they hie them, whither they will, each
               with the man he has led about. If you are willing to be led by me
               in one or another of these disguises, before it can get wind that you
               are here, I can bring you whither you would go; otherwise I see not
               how you are to quit this place without being known; and the lady's
               brothers-in-law, reckoning that you must be lurking somewhere in this
               quarter, have set guards all about to take you. 
               Loath indeed was Fra
               Alberto to go in such a guise, but such was his fear of the lady's relations
               that he consented, and told the good man whither he desired to be
               taken, and that he was content to leave the choice of the disguise
               to him. The good man then smeared him all over with honey, and
               covered him with down, set a chain on his neck and a vizard on
               his face, gave him a stout cudgel to carry in one hand, and two
               huge dogs, which he had brought from the shambles, to lead with
               the other, and sent a man to the <span class="place">Rialto</span> to announce that whoso would
               see the Angel Gabriel should hie him to the piazza of <span class="place">San Marco</span>; in
               all which he acted as a leal Venetian. And so, after a while, he led
               him forth, and then, making him go before, held him by the chain
               behind, and through a great throng that clamoured: What manner
               of thing is this? what manner of thing is this? he brought him
               to the piazza, where, what with those that followed them, and those
               that had come from the <span class="place">Rialto</span> on hearing the announcement, there
               were folk without end. Arrived at the piazza, he fastened his wild
               man to a column in a high and exposed place, making as if he were
               minded to wait till the hunt should begin; whereby the flies and
               gadflies, attracted by the honey with which he was smeared, caused
               him most grievous distress. However, the good man waited only
               until the piazza was thronged, and then, making as if he would
               unchain his wild man, he tore the vizard from Fra Alberto's face,
               saying: Gentlemen, as the boar comes not to the hunt, and the hunt
               does not take place, that it be not for nothing that you are come hither,
               I am minded to give you a view of the Angel Gabriel, who comes
               down from heaven to earth by night to solace the ladies of <span class="place">Venice</span>.
               The vizard was no sooner withdrawn than all recognized Fra Alberto,
               and greeted him with hootings, rating him in language as offensive
               and opprobrious as ever rogue was abused withal, and pelting him in
               the face with every sort of filth that came to hand: in which plight
               they kept him an exceeding great while, until by chance the bruit
               thereof reached his brethren, of whom some six thereupon put themselves
               in motion, and, arrived at the piazza, clapped a habit on his
               back, and unchained him, and amid an immense uproar led him off
               to their convent, where, after languishing a while in prison, 'tis believed
               that he died.
            </p>
            <p>So this man, by reason that, being reputed righteous, he did evil,
               and 'twas not imputed to him, presumed to counterfeit the Angel
               Gabriel, and, being transformed into a wild man, was in the end put
               to shame, as he deserved, and vainly bewailed his misdeeds. God
               grant that so it may betide all his likes.

               <p>Well may ye wot, young ladies, for 'tis abundantly manifest, that
                  	there is no vice but most grievous disaster may ensue thereon to him
                  	that practises it, and not seldom to others; and of all the vices that
                  	which hurries us into peril with loosest rein is, methinks, anger;
                  	which is nought but a rash and hasty impulse, prompted by a feeling
                  	of pain, which banishes reason, shrouds the eyes of the mind in thick
                  	darkness, and sets the soul ablaze with a fierce frenzy. 
                  	Which,
                  	though it not seldom befall men, and one rather than another, has
                  	nevertheless been observed to be fraught in women with more
                  	disastrous consequences, inasmuch as in them the flame is both more
                  	readily kindled, and burns more brightly, and with less impediment
                  	to its vehemence. Wherein is no cause to marvel, for, if we consider
                  	it, we shall see that 'tis of the nature of fire to lay hold more readily
                  	of things light and delicate than of matters of firmer and more solid
                  	substance; and sure it is that we (without offence to the men be it
                  	spoken) are more delicate than they, and much more mobile. 
                  	Wherefore,
                  	seeing how prone we are thereto by nature, and considering
                  	also our gentleness and tenderness, how soothing and consolatory they
                  	are to the men with whom we consort, and that thus this madness
                  	of wrath is fraught with grievous annoy and peril; therefore, that
                  	with stouter heart we may defend ourselves against it, I purpose by
                  	my story to shew you, how the loves of three young men, and as
                  	many ladies, as I said before, were by the anger of one of the ladies
                  	changed from a happy to a most woeful complexion.

            <p><span class="place">Marseilles</span>, as you know, is situate on the coast of <span class="place">Provence</span>, a
               city ancient and most famous, and in old time the seat of many more
               rich men and great merchants than are to be seen there to-day,
               among whom was one Narnald Cluada by name, a man of the lowest
               origin, but a merchant of unsullied probity and integrity, and boundless
               wealth in lands and goods and money, who had by his lady several
               children, three of them being daughters, older, each of them, than
               the other children, who were sons. Two of the daughters, who
               were twins, were, when my story begins, fifteen years old, and the
               third was but a year younger, so that in order to their marriage their
               kinsfolk awaited nothing but the return of Narnald from <span class="place">Spain</span>,
               whither he was gone with his merchandise. One of the twins was
               called Ninette, the other Madeleine; the third daughter's name was
               Bertelle. A young man, Restagnon by name, who, though poor,
               was of gentle blood, was in the last degree enamoured of Ninette,
               and she of him; and so discreetly had they managed the affair,
               that, never another soul in the world witting aught of it, they had
               had joyance of their love, and that for a good while, when it so
               befell that two young friends of theirs, the one Foulques, the other
               Hugues by name, whom their fathers, recently dead, had left very
               wealthy, fell in love, the one with Madeleine, the other with Bertelle.
               
               Whereof Restagnon being apprised by Ninette bethought him that
               in their love he might find a means to the relief of his necessities.
               He accordingly consorted freely and familiarly with them, accompanying,
               now one, now the other, and sometimes both of them, when
               they went to visit their ladies and his; and when he judged that he
               had made his footing as friendly and familiar as need was, he bade
               them one day to his house, and said: Comrades most dear, our
               friendship, perchance, may not have left you without assurance of
               the great love I bear you, and that for you I would do even as much
               as for myself: wherefore, loving you thus much, I purpose to impart
               to you that which is in my mind, that in regard thereof, you and I
               together may then resolve in such sort as to you shall seem the best.
               You, if I may trust your words, as also what I seem to have gathered
               from your demeanour by day and by night, burn with an exceeding
               great love for the two ladies whom you affect, as I for their sister.
               For the assuagement whereof, I have good hope that, if you will
               unite with me, I shall find means most sweet and delightsome; to
               wit, on this wise. You possess, as I do not, great wealth: now if
               you are willing to make of your wealth a common stock with me as
               third partner therein, and to choose some part of the world where
               we may live in careless ease upon our substance, without any manner
               of doubt I trust so to prevail that the three sisters with great part of
               their father's substance shall come to live with us, wherever we shall
               see fit to go; whereby, each with his own lady, we shall live as
               three brethren, the happiest men in the world. 'Tis now for you to
               determine whether you will embrace this proffered solace, or let it
               slip from you. 
               The two young men, whose love was beyond all
               measure fervent, spared themselves the trouble of deliberation: 'twas
               enough that they heard that they were to have their ladies: wherefore
               they answered, that, so this should ensue, they were ready to do
               as he proposed. Having thus their answer, Restagnon a few days
               later was closeted with Ninette, to whom 'twas a matter of no small
               difficulty for him to get access. Nor had he been long with her
               before he adverted to what had passed between him and the young
               men, and sought to commend the project to her for reasons not a
               few. 
               Little need, however, had he to urge her: for to live their life
               openly together was the very thing she desired, far more than he:
               wherefore she frankly answered that she would have it so, that her
               sisters would do, more especially in this matter, just as she wished,
               and that he should lose no time in making all the needful arrangements.
               So Restagnon returned to the two young men, who were
               most urgent that it should be done even as he said, and told them
               that on the part of the ladies the matter was concluded. 
               And so,
               having fixed upon <span class="place">Crete</span> for their destination, and sold some estates
               that they had, giving out that they were minded to go a trading with
               the proceeds, they converted all else that they possessed into money,
               and bought a brigantine, which with all secrecy they handsomely
               equipped, anxiously expecting the time of their departure, while
               Ninette on her part, knowing well how her sisters were affected,
               did so by sweet converse foment their desire that, till it should be
               accomplished, they accounted their life as nought. 
               The night of
               their embarcation being come, the three sisters opened a great chest
               that belonged to their father, and took out therefrom a vast quantity
               of money and jewels, with which they all three issued forth of the
               house in dead silence, as they had been charged, and found their
               three lovers awaiting them; who, having forthwith brought them
               aboard the brigantine, bade the rowers give way, and, tarrying
               nowhere, arrived the next evening at <span class="place">Genoa</span>, where the new lovers
               had for the first time joyance and solace of their love.
            </p>
            <p>Having taken what they needed of refreshment, they resumed
               their course, touching at this port and that, and in less than eight
               days, speeding without impediment, were come to <span class="place">Crete</span>. There
               they bought them domains both beautiful and broad, whereon, hard
               by <span class="place">Candia</span> they built them mansions most goodly and delightsome,
               wherein they lived as barons, keeping a crowd of retainers, with
               dogs, hawks and horses, and speeding the time with their ladies in
               feasting and revelling and merrymaking, none so light-hearted as
               they. Such being the tenor of their life, it so befell that (as 'tis
               matter of daily experience that, however delightsome a thing may
               be, superabundance thereof will breed disgust) Restagnon, much as
               he had loved Ninette, being now able to have his joyance of her
               without stint or restraint, began to weary of her, and by consequence
               to abate somewhat of his love for her. And being mightily pleased
               with a fair gentlewoman of the country, whom he met at a merry-making,
               he set his whole heart upon her, and began to shew himself
               marvellously courteous and gallant towards her; which Ninette
               perceiving
               grew so jealous that he might not go a step but she knew of
               it, and resented it to his torment and her own with high words. 
               But
               as, while superfluity engenders disgust, appetite is but whetted when
               fruit is forbidden, so Ninette's wrath added fuel to the flame of
               Restagnon's new love. And whichever was the event, whether in
               course of time Restagnon had the lady's favour or had it not, Ninette,
               whoever may have brought her the tidings, firmly believed that he
               had it; whereby from the depths of distress she passed into a towering
               passion, and thus was transported into such a frenzy of rage that
               all the love she bore to Restagnon was converted into bitter hatred,
               and, blinded by her wrath, she made up her mind to avenge by
               Restagnon's death the dishonour which she deemed that he had done
               her. So she had recourse to an old Greek woman, that was very
               skilful in compounding poisons, whom by promises and gifts she
               induced to distill a deadly water, which, keeping her own counsel,
               she herself gave Restagnon to drink one evening, when he was
               somewhat heated and quite off his guard: whereby--such was the
               efficacy of the water--she despatched Restagnon before matins. On
               learning his death Foulques and Hugues and their ladies, who knew
               not that he had been poisoned, united their bitter with Ninette's
               feigned lamentations, and gave him honourable sepulture. But so it
               befell that, not many days after, the old woman, that had compounded
               the poison for Ninette, was taken for another crime; and, being put
               to the torture, confessed the compounding of the poison among other
               of her misdeeds, and fully declared what had thereby come to pass.
               Wherefore the Duke of <span class="place">Crete</span>, breathing no word of his intent, came
               privily by night, and set a guard around Foulques' palace, where
               Ninette then was, and quietly, and quite unopposed, took and carried
               her off; and without putting her to the torture, learned from her in
               a trice all that he sought to know touching the death of Restagnon.
               Foulques and Hugues had learned privily of the Duke, and their
               ladies of them, for what cause Ninette was taken; and, being mightily
               distressed thereby, bestirred themselves with all zeal to save Ninette
               from the fire, to which they apprehended she would be condemned,
               as having indeed richly deserved it; but all their endeavours seemed
               to avail nothing, for the Duke was unwaveringly resolved that justice
               should be done. 
               Madeleine, Foulques' fair wife, who had long been
               courted by the Duke, but had never deigned to shew him the least
               favour, thinking that by yielding herself to his will she might redeem
               her sister from the fire, despatched a trusty envoy to him with the
               intimation that she was entirely at his disposal upon the twofold
               condition, that in the first place her sister should be restored to her
               free and scatheless, and, in the second place, the affair should be kept
               secret. 
               Albeit gratified by this overture, the Duke was long in doubt
               whether he should accept it; in the end, however, he made up his
               mind to do so, and signified his approval to the envoy. Then with
               the lady's consent he put Foulques and Hugues under arrest for a
               night, as if he were minded to examine them of the affair, and
               meanwhile quartered himself privily with Madeleine. 
               Ninette, who,
               he had made believe, had been set in a sack, and was to be sunk
               in the sea that same night, he took with him, and presented her to
               her sister in requital of the night's joyance, which, as he parted from
               her on the morrow, he prayed her might not be the last, as it was
               the first, fruit of their love, at the same time enjoining her to send
               the guilty lady away that she might not bring reproach upon him,
               nor he be compelled to deal rigorously with her again. 
               Released the
               same morning, and told that Ninette had been cast into the sea,
               Foulques and Hugues, fully believing that so it was, came home,
               thinking how they should console their ladies for the death of their
               sister; but, though Madeleine was at great pains to conceal Ninette,
               Foulques nevertheless, to his no small amazement, discovered that
               she was there; which at once excited his suspicion, for he knew that
               the Duke had been enamoured of Madeleine; and he asked how it
               was that Ninette was there. Madeleine made up a long story by
               way of explanation, to which his sagacity gave little credit, and in
               the end after long parley he constrained her to tell the truth. Whereupon,
               overcome with grief, and transported with rage, he drew his
               sword, and, deaf to her appeals for mercy, slew her. 
               Then, fearing
               the vengeful justice of the Duke, he left the dead body in the room,
               and hied him to Ninette, and with a counterfeit gladsome mien said
               to her: Go we without delay whither thy sister has appointed
               that I escort thee, that thou fall not again into the hands of the
               Duke. Ninette believed him, and being fain to go for very fear,
               she forewent further leave-taking of her sister, more particularly as
               it was now night, and set out with Foulques, who took with him
               such little money as he could lay his hands upon; and so they made
               their way to the coast, where they got aboard a bark, but none ever
               knew where their voyage ended.
            </p>
            <p>Madeleine's dead body being discovered next day, certain evildisposed
               folk, that bore a grudge to Hugues, forthwith apprised the
               Duke of the fact; which brought the Duke--for much he loved
               Madeleine--in hot haste to the house, where he arrested Hugues and
               his lady, who as yet knew nothing of the departure of Foulques and
               Ninette, and extorted from them a confession that they and Foulques
               were jointly answerable for Madeleine's death. 
               For which cause being
               justly apprehensive of death, they with great address corrupted the
               guards that had charge of them, giving them a sum of money which
               they kept concealed in their house against occasions of need; and
               together with the guards fled with all speed, leaving all that they
               possessed behind them, and took ship by night for <span class="place">Rhodes</span>, where,
               being arrived, they lived in great poverty and misery no long time.
               Such then was the issue, to which Restagnon, by his foolish love, and
               Ninette by her wrath brought themselves and others.

            <p>Guglielmo, the Second,First, according to the now accepted
               	reckoning. He reigned from 1154
               	to 1166. as the Sicilians compute, King of <span class="place">Sicily</span>,
               had two children, a son named Ruggieri, and a daughter named
               Gostanza. Ruggieri died before his father, and left a son named
               <span class="person">Gerbino</span>; who, being carefully trained by his grandfather, grew up a
               most goodly gallant, and of great renown in court and camp, 
               and
               that not only within the borders of <span class="place">Sicily</span>, but in divers other parts
               of the world, among them Barbary, then tributary to the King of
               <span class="place">Sicily</span>. And among others, to whose ears was wafted the bruit of
               <span class="person">Gerbino</span>'s magnificent prowess and courtesy, was a daughter of the
               King of <span class="place">Tunis</span>, who, by averment of all that had seen her, was a
               creature as fair and debonair, and of as great and noble a spirit as
               Nature ever formed. To hear tell of brave men was her delight, and
               what she heard, now from one, now from another, of the brave deeds
               of <span class="person">Gerbino</span> she treasured in her mind so sedulously, and pondered
               them with such pleasure, rehearsing them to herself in imagination,
               that she became hotly enamoured of him, and there was none
               of whom she talked, or heard others talk, so gladly. Nor, on the
               other hand, had the fame of her incomparable beauty and other
               excellences failed to travel, as to other lands, so also to <span class="place">Sicily</span>, where,
               falling on <span class="person">Gerbino</span>'s ears, it gave him no small delight, to such effect
               that he burned for the lady no less vehemently than she for him.
               Wherefore, until such time as he might, upon some worthy occasion,
               have his grandfather's leave to go to <span class="place">Tunis</span>, yearning beyond measure
               to see her, he charged every friend of his, that went thither, to give
               her to know, as best he might, his great and secret love for her, and
               to bring him tidings of her. Which office one of the said friends
               discharged with no small address; for, having obtained access to her,
               after the manner of merchants, by bringing jewels for her to look at,
               he fully apprised her of <span class="person">Gerbino</span>'s passion, and placed him, and all
               that he possessed, entirely at her disposal. The lady received both
               messenger and message with gladsome mien, made answer that she
               loved with equal ardour, and in token thereof sent <span class="person">Gerbino</span> one of
               her most precious jewels. <span class="person">Gerbino</span> received the jewel with extreme
               delight, and sent her many a letter and many a most precious gift by
               the hand of the same messenger; and 'twas well understood between
               them that, should Fortune accord him opportunity, he should see
               and know her.
            </p>
            <p>On this footing the affair remained somewhat longer than was
               expedient; and so, while <span class="person">Gerbino</span> and the lady burned with mutual
               love, it befell that the King of <span class="place">Tunis</span> gave her in marriage to the
               King of <span class="place">Granada</span>;An anachronism; the Moorish kingdom of <span class="place">Granada</span> not
               having been
               founded until 1238. whereat she was wroth beyond measure, for that
               she was not only going into a country remote from her lover, but, as
               she deemed, was severed from him altogether; and so this might not
               come to pass, gladly, could she but have seen how, would she have
               left her father and fled to <span class="person">Gerbino</span>. In like manner, <span class="person">Gerbino</span>, on
               learning of the marriage, was vexed beyond measure, and was ofttimes
               minded, could he but find means to win to her husband by
               sea, to wrest her from him by force. Some rumour of <span class="person">Gerbino</span>'s love,
               and of his intent, reached the King of <span class="place">Tunis</span>, who, knowing his
               prowess and power, took alarm, and as the time drew nigh for
               conveying the lady to <span class="place">Granada</span>, sent word of his purpose to King
               Guglielmo, and craved his assurance that it might be carried into
               effect without let or hindrance on the part of <span class="person">Gerbino</span>, or any one
               else. The old King had heard nothing of <span class="person">Gerbino</span>'s love affair, and
               never dreaming that 'twas on such account that the assurance was
               craved, granted it without demur, and in pledge thereof sent the
               King of <span class="place">Tunis</span> his glove. Which received, the King made ready
               a great and goodly ship in the port of <span class="place">Carthage</span>, and equipped
               her with all things meet for those that were to man her, and
               with all appointments apt and seemly for the reception of his
               daughter, and awaited only fair weather to send her therein to
               <span class="place">Granada</span>. All which the young lady seeing and marking, sent
               one of her servants privily to <span class="place">Palermo</span>, bidding him greet the
               illustrious <span class="person">Gerbino</span> on her part, and tell him that a few days
               would see her on her way to <span class="place">Granada</span>; wherefore 'twould now appear
               whether, or no, he were really as doughty a man as he was reputed,
               and loved her as much as he had so often protested. 
               The servant
               did not fail to deliver her message exactly, and returned to <span class="place">Tunis</span>,
               leaving <span class="person">Gerbino</span>, who knew that his grandfather, King Guglielmo,
               had given the King of <span class="place">Tunis</span> the desired assurance, at a loss how to
               act. But prompted by love, and goaded by the lady's words and
               loath to seem a craven, he hied him to <span class="place">Messina</span>; and having there
               armed two light galleys, and manned them with good men and true,
               he put to sea, and stood for <span class="place">Sardinia</span>, deeming that the lady's ship must
               pass that way. Nor was he far out in his reckoning; for he had
               not been there many days, when the ship, sped by a light breeze, hove
               in sight not far from the place where he lay in wait for her. Whereupon
               <span class="person">Gerbino</span> said to his comrades: Gentlemen, if you be as good
               men and true as I deem you, there is none of you but must have felt, if
               he feel not now, the might of love; for without love I deem no
               mortal capable of true worth or aught that is good; and if you are
               or have been in love, 'twill be easy for you to understand that which
               I desire. I love, and 'tis because I love that I have laid this travail
               upon you; and that which I love is in the ship that you see before
               you, which is fraught not only with my beloved, but with immense
               treasures, which, if you are good men and true, we, so we but play
               the man in fight, may with little trouble make our own; nor for
               my share of the spoils of the victory demand I aught but a lady,
               whose love it is that prompts me to take arms: all else I freely cede
               to you from this very hour. Forward, then; attack we this ship;
               success should be ours, for God favours our enterprise, nor lends her
               wind to evade us. 
               Fewer words might have sufficed the illustrious
               <span class="person">Gerbino</span>; for the rapacious Messinese that were with him were
               already bent heart and soul upon that to which by his harangue he
               sought to animate them. So, when he had done, they raised a
               mighty shout, so that 'twas as if trumpets did blare, and caught up
               their arms, and smiting the water with their oars, overhauled the
               ship. The advancing galleys were observed while they were yet a
               great way off by the ship's crew, who, not being able to avoid the
               combat, put themselves in a posture of defence. Arrived at close
               quarters, the illustrious <span class="person">Gerbino</span> bade send the ship's masters aboard
               the galleys, unless they were minded to do battle. 
               Certified of the
               challenge, and who they were that made it, the Saracens answered
               that 'twas in breach of the faith plighted to them by their assailants'
               king that they were thus attacked, and in token thereof displayed
               King Guglielmo's glove, averring in set terms that there should be
               no surrender either of themselves or of aught that was aboard the
               ship without battle. 
               <span class="person">Gerbino</span>, who had observed the lady standing
               on the ship's poop, and seen that she was far more beautiful than he
               had imagined, burned with a yet fiercer flame than before, and to
               the display of the glove made answer, that, as he had no falcons there
               just then, the glove booted him not; wherefore, so they were not
               minded to surrender the lady, let them prepare to receive battle.
               Whereupon, without further delay, the battle began on both sides
               with a furious discharge of arrows and stones; on which wise it was
               long protracted to their common loss; until at last <span class="person">Gerbino</span>, seeing
               that he gained little advantage, took a light bark which they had
               brought from <span class="place">Sardinia</span>, and having fired her, bore down with her,
               and both the galleys, upon the ship. Whereupon the Saracens,
               seeing that they must perforce surrender the ship or die, caused the
               King's daughter, who lay beneath the deck weeping, to come up on
               deck, and led her to the prow, and shouting to <span class="person">Gerbino</span>, while the
               lady shrieked alternately mercy and succour, opened her veins
               before his eyes, and cast her into the sea, saying: Take her; we
               give her to thee on such wise as we can, and as thy faith has merited.
               Maddened to witness this deed of barbarism, <span class="person">Gerbino</span>, as if courting
               death, recked no more of the arrows and the stones, but drew alongside
               the ship, and, despite the resistance of her crew, boarded her;
               and as a famished lion ravens amongst a herd of oxen, and tearing
               and rending, now one, now another, gluts his wrath before he appeases
               his hunger, so <span class="person">Gerbino</span>, sword in hand, hacking and hewing on all
               sides among the Saracens, did ruthlessly slaughter not a few of them;
               till, as the burning ship began to blaze more fiercely, he bade the
               seamen take thereout all that they might by way of guerdon, which
               done, he quitted her, having gained but a rueful victory over his
               adversaries. His next care was to recover from the sea the body of
               the fair lady, whom long and with many a tear he mourned: and
               so he returned to <span class="place">Sicily</span>, and gave the body honourable sepulture in
               <span class="place">Ustica</span>, an islet that faces, as it were, <span class="place">Trapani</span>, and went home the
               saddest man alive.
            </p>
            <p>When these tidings reached the King of <span class="place">Tunis</span>, he sent to King
               Guglielmo ambassadors, habited in black, who made complaint
               of the breach of faith and recited the manner of its occurrence.
               Which caused King Guglielmo no small chagrin; and seeing not
               how he might refuse the justice they demanded, he had <span class="person">Gerbino</span>
               arrested, and he himself, none of his barons being able by any
               entreaty to turn him from his purpose, sentenced him to forfeit his
               head, and had it severed from his body in his presence, preferring
               to suffer the loss of his only grandson than to gain the reputation of
               a faithless king. And so, miserably, within the compass of a few
               brief days, died the two lovers by woeful deaths, as I have told you,
               and without having known any joyance of their love.

               </p>
            </div>
            <p>Know then that there were at <span class="place">Messina</span> three young men, that
               were brothers and merchants, who were left very rich on the death
               of their father, who was of <span class="place">San Gimignano</span>; and they had a sister,
               <span class="person">Lisabetta</span> by name, a girl fair enough, and no less debonair, but
               whom, for some reason or another, they had not as yet bestowed in
               marriage. The three brothers had also in their shop a young Pisan,
               <span class="person">Lorenzo</span> by name, who managed all their affairs, and who was so
               goodly of person and gallant, that <span class="person">Lisabetta</span> bestowed many a glance
               upon him, and began to regard him with extraordinary favour;
               which <span class="person">Lorenzo</span> marking from time to time, gave up all his other
               amours, and in like manner began to affect her, and so, their loves
               being equal, 'twas not long before they took heart of grace, and did
               that which each most desired. Wherein continuing to their no
               small mutual solace and delight, they neglected to order it with due
               secrecy, whereby one night as <span class="person">Lisabetta</span> was going to <span class="person">Lorenzo</span>'s
               room, she, all unwitting, was observed by the eldest of the brothers,
               who, albeit much distressed by what he had learnt, yet, being a
               young man of discretion, was swayed by considerations more seemly,
               and, allowing no word to escape him, spent the night in turning the
               affair over in his mind in divers ways. On the morrow he told his
               brothers that which, touching <span class="person">Lisabetta</span> and <span class="person">Lorenzo</span>, he had observed
               in the night, which, that no shame might thence ensue either to
               them or to their sister, they after long consultation determined to pass
               over in silence, making as if they had seen or heard nought thereof,
               until such time as they in a safe and convenient manner might
               banish this disgrace from their sight before it could go further.
               Adhering to which purpose, they jested and laughed with <span class="person">Lorenzo</span>
               as they had been wont; and after a while pretending that they were
               all three going forth of the city on pleasure, they took <span class="person">Lorenzo</span> with
               them; and being come to a remote and very lonely spot, seeing that
               'twas apt for their design, they took <span class="person">Lorenzo</span>, who was completely
               off his guard, and slew him, and buried him on such wise that none
               was ware of it. On their return to <span class="place">Messina</span> they gave out that they
               had sent him away on business; which was readily believed, because
               'twas what they had been frequently used to do. But as <span class="person">Lorenzo</span>
               did not return, and <span class="person">Lisabetta</span> questioned the brothers about him with
               great frequency and urgency, being sorely grieved by his long
               absence, it so befell that one day, when she was very pressing in her
               enquiries, one of the brothers said: What means this? What
               hast thou to do with <span class="person">Lorenzo</span>, that thou shouldst ask about him so
               often? Ask us no more, or we will give thee such answer as thou
               deservest. 
               So the girl, sick at heart and sorrowful, fearing she
               knew not what, asked no questions; but many a time at night she
               called piteously to him, and besought him to come to her, and
               bewailed his long tarrying with many a tear, and ever yearning for
               his return, languished in total dejection.
            </p>
            <p>But so it was that one night, when, after long weeping that her
               <span class="person">Lorenzo</span> came not back, she had at last fallen asleep, <span class="person">Lorenzo</span>
               appeared to her in a dream, wan and in utter disarray, his clothes
               torn to shreds and sodden; and thus, as she thought, he spoke:
               <span class="person">Lisabetta</span>, thou dost nought but call me, and vex thyself for my
               long tarrying, and bitterly upbraid me with thy tears; wherefore be
               it known to thee that return to thee I may not, because the last day
               that thou didst see me thy brothers slew me. After which, he
               described the place where they had buried him, told her to call and
               expect him no more, and vanished. The girl then awoke, and
               doubting not that the vision was true, wept bitterly. And when
               morning came, and she was risen, not daring to say aught to her
               brothers, she resolved to go to the place indicated in the vision, and
               see if what she had dreamed were even as it had appeared to her.
               So, having leave to go a little way out of the city for recreation in
               company with a maid that had at one time lived with them and
               knew all that she did, she hied her thither with all speed; and having
               removed the dry leaves that were strewn about the place, she began
               to dig where the earth seemed least hard. Nor had she dug long,
               before she found the body of her hapless lover, whereon as yet
               there was no trace of corruption or decay; and thus she saw without
               any manner of doubt that her vision was true. And so, saddest of
               women, knowing that she might not bewail him there, she would
               gladly, if she could, have carried away the body and given it more
               honourable sepulture elsewhere; but as she might not so do, she
               took a knife, and, as best she could, severed the head from the trunk,
               and wrapped it in a napkin and laid it in the lap of her maid; and
               having covered the rest of the corpse with earth, she left the spot,
               having been seen by none, and went home. There she shut herself
               up in her room with the head, and kissed it a thousand times in every
               part, and wept long and bitterly over it, till she had bathed it in her
               tears. She then wrapped it in a piece of fine cloth, and set it in a
               large and beautiful pot of the sort in which marjoram or basil is
               planted, and covered it with earth, and therein planted some roots
               of the goodliest basil of <span class="place">Salerno</span>, and drenched them only with her
               tears, or water perfumed with roses or orange-blossoms. And 'twas
               her wont ever to sit beside this pot, and, all her soul one yearning, to
               pore upon it, as that which enshrined her <span class="person">Lorenzo</span>, and when long
               time she had so done, she would bend over it, and weep a great
               while, until the basil was quite bathed in her tears.
            </p>
            <p>Fostered with such constant, unremitting care, and nourished by
               the richness given to the soil by the decaying head that lay therein,
               the basil burgeoned out in exceeding great beauty and fragrance.
               And, the girl persevering ever in this way of life, the neighbours from
               time to time took note of it, and when her brothers marvelled to see
               her beauty ruined, and her eyes as it were evanished from her head,
               they told them of it, saying: We have observed that such is her
               daily wont. Whereupon the brothers, marking her behaviour, chid
               her therefore once or twice, and as she heeded them not, caused the
               pot to be taken privily from her. Which, so soon as she missed it,
               she demanded with the utmost instance and insistence, and, as they
               gave it not back to her, ceased not to wail and weep, insomuch that
               she fell sick; nor in her sickness craved she aught but the pot of
               basil. Whereat the young men, marvelling mightily, resolved to
               see what the pot might contain; and having removed the earth they
               espied the cloth, and therein the head, which was not yet so decayed,
               but that by the curled locks they knew it for <span class="person">Lorenzo</span>'s head. Passing
               strange they found it, and fearing lest it should be bruited abroad,
               they buried the head, and, with as little said as might be, took order
               for their privy departure from <span class="place">Messina</span>, and hied them thence to
               <span class="place">Naples</span>. The girl ceased not to weep and crave her pot, and, so
               weeping, died. Such was the end of her disastrous love; but not a
               few in course of time coming to know the truth of the affair, there
               was one that made the song that is still sung: to wit:
            </p>
            <div class="song">

               	A sorry Christian he,
               	That took my basil of <span class="place">Salerno</span> fair, etc.This Sicilian folk-song, of which Boccaccio quotes only the first two
               	lines, is given in extenso from MS. Laurent. 38, plut. 42, by Fanfani in his
               	edition of the Decameron (<span class="place">Florence</span>, 1857). The following is a free
               	rendering:
               		  A thief he was, I swear,
               	  A sorry Christian he,
               	  That took my basil of <span class="place">Salerno</span> fair,
               	  That flourished mightily.

               	To spoil another's goods is churlish spite,
               	  Ay, and most heinous sin.
               	  
               	  A basil had I (alas! luckless wight!),
               	  The fairest plant: within
               	  Its shade I slept: 'twas grown to such a height.
               	  But some folk for chagrin

               		  'Reft me thereof, ay, and before my door.
               	  Ah! dolorous day and drear!
               	  Ah! woe is me! Would God I were no more!
               	  My purchase was so dear!
               	  Ah! why that day did I to watch give o'er?
               	  For him my cherished fere

               	With marjoram I bordered it about
               	  In May-time fresh and fair,

               	  And marked it grow full yare:

               	  defective
               	  in the original.
               
               	But now 'tis stolen. Ah! too well 'tis known!
               	  That no more may I hide:
               	  But had to me a while before been shewn
               	  What then should me betide,
               	  At night before my door I had laid me down
               	  To watch my plant beside.
               	  Yet God Almighty sure me succour might.
               	
               	Ay, God Almighty sure me succour might,

               	  That in dire torment still
               	  I languish, since the thief reft from my sight
               	  My plant that did me thrill,

               	And to my inmost soul such comfort lent!

               	  My watering to do,
               	  I'd hear the people all in wonderment
               	  Say, whence this perfume new?
               	  And I for love of it of grief shall die.
               	
               	
               	And I for love of it of grief shall die,
               	  Of my fair plant for dole.

               <p>By the dream
                  	told in the foregoing story I am prompted to relate one in which
                  	two dreams are told, dreams of that which was to come, as <span class="person">Lisabetta</span>'s
                  	was of that which had been, and which were both fulfilled
                  	almost as soon as they were told by those that had dreamed them.
                  	Wherefore, loving ladies, you must know that 'tis the common
                  	experience of mankind to have divers visions during sleep; and albeit
                  	the sleeper, while he sleeps, deems all alike most true, but, being
                  	awake, judges some of them to be true, others to be probable, and
                  	others again to be quite devoid of truth, yet not a few are found to
                  	have come to pass. For which cause many are as sure of every
                  	dream as of aught that they see in their waking hours, and so, as
                  	their dreams engender in them fear or hope, are sorrowful or joyous.
                  	And on the other hand there are those that credit no dream, until
                  	they see themselves fallen into the very peril whereof they were
                  	forewarned. Of whom I approve neither sort, for in sooth neither are
                  	all dreams true, nor all alike false. That they are not all true, there
                  	is none of us but may many a time have proved; and that they are
                  	not all alike false has already been shewn in <span class="person">Filomena</span>'s story, and
                  	shall also, as I said before, be shewn in mine. Wherefore I deem
                  	that in a virtuous course of life and conduct there is no need to fear
                  	aught by reason of any dream that is contrary thereto, or on that
                  	account to give up any just design; and as for crooked and sinister
                  	enterprises, however dreams may seem to favour them, and flatter
                  	the hopes of the dreamer with auspicious omens, none should trust
                  	them: rather should all give full credence to such as run counter
                  	thereto. But come we to the story.
               </p>
            </div>
            <p>In the city of <span class="place">Brescia</span> there lived of yore a gentleman named
               Messer Negro da Ponte Carraro, who with other children had a
               very fair daughter, Andreuola by name, who, being unmarried,
               chanced to fall in love with a neighbour, one <span class="person">Gabriotto</span>, a man of
               low degree, but goodly of person and debonair, and endowed with
               all admirable qualities; and aided and abetted by the housemaid, the
               girl not only brought it to pass that <span class="person">Gabriotto</span> knew that he was
               beloved of her, but that many a time to their mutual delight he
               came to see her in a fair garden belonging to her father. And that
               nought but death might avail to sever them from this their gladsome
               love, they became privily man and wife; and, while thus they
               continued their clandestine intercourse, it happened that one night,
               while the girl slept, she saw herself in a dream in her garden with
               <span class="person">Gabriotto</span>, who to the exceeding great delight of both held her in his
               arms; and while thus they lay, she saw issue from his body somewhat
               dark and frightful, the shape whereof she might not discern;
               which, as she thought, laid hold of <span class="person">Gabriotto</span>, and in her despite
               with prodigious force reft him from her embrace, and bore him with
               it underground, so that both were lost to her sight for evermore:
               whereby stricken with sore and inexpressible grief, she awoke; and
               albeit she was overjoyed to find that 'twas not as she had dreamed,
               yet a haunting dread of what she had seen in her vision entered her
               soul. Wherefore, <span class="person">Gabriotto</span> being minded to visit her on the ensuing
               night, she did her best endeavour to dissuade him from coming; but
               seeing that he was bent upon it, lest he should suspect somewhat,
               she received him in her garden, where, having culled roses many,
               white and red--for 'twas summer--she sat herself down with him
               at the base of a most fair and lucent fountain. There long and
               joyously they dallied, and then <span class="person">Gabriotto</span> asked her wherefore she
               had that day forbade his coming. Whereupon the lady told him
               her dream of the night before, and the doubt and fear which it had
               engendered in her mind. Whereat <span class="person">Gabriotto</span> laughed, and said that
               'twas the height of folly to put any faith in dreams, for that they
               were occasioned by too much or too little food, and were daily seen
               to be, one and all, things of nought, adding: 
               Were I minded to
               give heed to dreams, I should not be here now, for I, too, had a
               dream last night, which was on this wise: Methought I was in
               a fair and pleasant wood, and there, a hunting, caught a she-goat as
               beautiful and loveable as any that ever was seen, and, as it seemed to
               me, whiter than snow, which in a little while grew so tame and
               friendly that she never stirred from my side. 
               All the same so jealous
               was I lest she should leave me, that, meseemed, I had set a collar of
               gold around her neck, and held her by a golden chain. 
               And presently
               meseemed that, while the she-goat lay at rest with her head in my
               lap, there came forth, I knew not whence, a greyhound bitch, black
               as coal, famished, and most fearsome to look upon; which made
               straight for me, and for, meseemed, I offered no resistance, set her
               muzzle to my breast on the left side and gnawed through to the
               heart, which, meseemed, she tore out to carry away with her.
               Whereupon ensued so sore a pain that it brake my sleep, and as I
               awoke I laid my hand to my side to feel if aught were amiss there;
               but finding nothing I laughed at myself that I had searched. But
               what signifies it all? Visions of the like sort, ay, and far more
               appalling, have I had in plenty, and nought whatever, great or small,
               has come of any of them. So let it pass, and think we how we may
               speed the time merrily.
            </p>
            <p>What she heard immensely enhanced the already great dread
               which her own dream had inspired in the girl; but, not to vex
               <span class="person">Gabriotto</span>, she dissembled her terror as best she might. But, though
               she made great cheer, embracing and kissing him, and receiving his
               embraces and kisses, yet she felt a doubt, she knew not why, and
               many a time, more than her wont, she would gaze upon his face,
               and ever and anon her glance would stray through the garden to
               see if any black creature were coming from any quarter. 
               While
               thus they passed the time, of a sudden <span class="person">Gabriotto</span> heaved a great
               sigh, and embracing her, said: Alas! my soul, thy succour! for
               I die. And so saying, he fell down upon the grassy mead. 
               Whereupon
               the girl drew him to her, and laid him on her lap, and all
               but wept, and said: O sweet my lord, what is't that ails thee?
               But <span class="person">Gabriotto</span> was silent, and gasping sore for breath, and bathed
               in sweat, in no long time departed this life.
            </p>
            <p>How grievous was the distress of the girl, who loved him more
               than herself, you, my ladies, may well imagine. With many a tear
               she mourned him, and many times she vainly called him by his
               name; but when, having felt his body all over, and found it cold in
               every part, she could no longer doubt that he was dead, knowing not
               what to say or do, she went, tearful and woebegone, to call the
               maid, to whom she had confided her love, and shewed her the
               woeful calamity that had befallen her. Piteously a while they wept
               together over the dead face of <span class="person">Gabriotto</span>, and then the girl said to
               the maid: Now that God has reft him from me, I have no
               mind to linger in this life; but before I slay myself, I would we
               might find apt means to preserve my honour, and the secret of our
               love, and to bury the body from which the sweet soul has fled.
               My daughter, said the maid, speak not of slaying thyself, for
               so wouldst thou lose in the other world, also, him that thou hast
               lost here; seeing that thou wouldst go to hell, whither, sure I am,
               his soul is not gone, for a good youth he was; far better were it to
               put on a cheerful courage, and bethink thee to succour his soul with
               thy prayers or pious works, if perchance he have need thereof by
               reason of any sin that he may have committed. 
               We can bury him
               readily enough in this garden, nor will any one ever know; for
               none knows that he ever came hither; and if thou wilt not have
               it so, we can bear him forth of the garden, and leave him there;
               and on the morrow he will be found, and carried home, and buried
               by his kinsfolk. 
               The girl, heavy-laden though she was with
               anguish, and still weeping, yet gave ear to the counsels of her maid,
               and rejecting the former alternative, made answer to the latter on
               this wise: Now God forbid that a youth so dear, whom I have
               so loved and made my husband, should with my consent be buried
               like a dog, or left out there in the street. He has had my tears, and
               so far as I may avail, he shall have the tears of his kinsfolk, and
               already wot I what we must do. 
               And forthwith she sent the maid
               for a piece of silken cloth, which she had in one of her boxes; and
               when the maid returned with it, they spread it on the ground, and
               laid <span class="person">Gabriotto</span>'s body thereon, resting the head upon a pillow. She
               then closed the eyes and mouth, shedding the while many a tear,
               wove for him a wreath of roses, and strewed upon him all the roses
               that he and she had gathered; which done, she said to the maid:
               'Tis but a short way hence to the door of his house; so thither we
               will bear him, thou and I, thus as we have dight him, and will lay
               him at the door. Day will soon dawn, and they will take him up;
               and, though 'twill be no consolation to them, I, in whose arms he
               died, shall be glad of it. 
               So saying, she burst once more into a
               torrent of tears, and fell with her face upon the face of the dead, and
               so long time she wept. Then, yielding at last to the urgency of her
               maid, for day was drawing nigh, she arose, drew from her finger the
               ring with which she had been wedded to <span class="person">Gabriotto</span>, and set it on
               his finger, saying with tears: 
               Dear my lord, if thy soul be witness
               of my tears, or if, when the spirit is fled, aught of intelligence or
               sense still lurk in the body, graciously receive the last gift of her
               whom in life thou didst so dearly love. Which said, she swooned,
               and fell upon the corpse; 
               but, coming after a while to herself, she
               arose; and then she and her maid took the cloth whereon the body
               lay, and so bearing it, quitted the garden, and bent their steps towards
               the dead man's house. As thus they went, it chanced that certain
               of the Podestà's guard, that for some reason or another were abroad
               at that hour, met them, and arrested them with the corpse. 
               Andreuola,
               to whom death was more welcome than life, no sooner knew
               them for the officers of the Signory than she frankly said: I know
               you, who you are, and that flight would avail me nothing: I am
               ready to come with you before the Signory, and to tell all there is to
               tell; but let none of you presume to touch me, so long as I obey
               you, or to take away aught that is on this body, if he would not that
               I accuse him. And so, none venturing to lay hand upon either her
               person or the corpse, she entered the palace.
            </p>
            <p>So soon as the Podestà was apprised of the affair, he arose,
               had
               her brought into his room, and there made himself conversant with
               the circumstances: and certain physicians being charged to inquire
               whether the good man had met his death by poison or otherwise, all
               with one accord averred that 'twas not by poison, but that he was
               choked by the bursting of an imposthume near the heart. 
               Which
               when the Podestà heard, perceiving that the girl's guilt could but
               be slight, he sought to make a pretence of giving what it was not
               lawful for him to sell her, and told her that he would set her at
               liberty, so she were consenting to pleasure him; 
               but finding that he
               did but waste his words he cast aside all decency, and would have
               used force. Whereupon Andreuola, kindling with scorn, waxed
               exceeding brave, and defended herself with a virile energy, and with
               high and contumelious words drove him from her.
            </p>
            <p>When 'twas broad day, the affair reached the ears of Messer
               Negro, who, half dead with grief, hied him with not a few of his
               friends to the palace; where, having heard all that the Podestà had
               to say, he required him peremptorily to give him back his daughter.
               The Podestà, being minded rather to be his own accuser, than that
               he should be accused by the girl of the violence that he had meditated
               towards her, began by praising her and her constancy, and in proof
               thereof went on to tell what he had done; he ended by saying, that,
               marking her admirable firmness, he had fallen mightily in love with
               her, and so, notwithstanding she had been wedded to a man of low
               degree, he would, if 'twere agreeable to her and to her father, Messer
               Negro, gladly make her his wife. While they thus spoke, Andreuola
               made her appearance, and, weeping, threw herself at her father's feet,
               saying: My father, I wot I need not tell you the story of my
               presumption, and the calamity that has befallen me, for sure I am
               that you have heard it and know it; wherefore, with all possible
               humility I crave your pardon of my fault, to wit, that without your
               knowledge I took for my husband him that pleased me best. 
               And
               this I crave, not that my life may be spared, but that I may die as
               your daughter and not as your enemy; and so, weeping, she fell at
               his feet. 
               Messer Negro, now an old man, and naturally kindly and
               affectionate, heard her not without tears, and weeping raised her
               tenderly to her feet, saying: Daughter mine, I had much liefer
               had it that thou hadst had a husband that I deemed a match for thee;
               and in that thou hadst taken one that pleased thee I too had been
               pleased; but thy concealing thy choice from me is grievous to me
               by reason of thy distrust of me, and yet more so, seeing that thou
               hast lost him before I have known him. 
               But as 'tis even so, to his
               remains be paid the honour which, while he lived for thy contentment,
               I had gladly done him as my son-in-law. Then, turning to
               his sons and kinsmen, he bade them order <span class="person">Gabriotto</span>'s obsequies with
               all pomp and honourable circumstance.
            </p>
            <p>Meanwhile the young man's kinsmen and kinswomen, having
               heard the news, had flocked thither, bringing with them almost all the
               rest of the folk, men and women alike, that were in the city. And so
               his body, resting on Andreuola's cloth, and covered with her roses,
               was laid out in the middle of the courtyard, and there was mourned
               not by her and his kinsfolk alone, but publicly by well-nigh all the
               women of the city, and not a few men; and shouldered by some of
               the noblest of the citizens, as it had been the remains of no plebeian
               but of a noble, was borne from the public courtyard to the tomb
               with exceeding great pomp.
            </p>
            <p>Some days afterwards, as the Podestà continued to urge his suit,
               Messer Negro would have discussed the matter with his daughter;
               but, as she would hear none of it, and he was minded in this matter
               to defer to her wishes, she and her maid entered a religious house of
               great repute for sanctity, where in just esteem they lived long time
               thereafter.

               <p>Dear gossips, Pamfilo's story puts me upon telling you another in
                  	no wise like thereto, save in this, that as Andreuola lost her lover in

            <p>Know then that no great while ago there dwelt in <span class="place">Florence</span> a
               maid most fair, and, for her rank, debonair--she was but a poor
               man's daughter--whose name was Simona; and though she must
               needs win with her own hands the bread she ate, and maintain
               herself by spinning wool; yet was she not, therefore, of so poor a
               spirit, but that she dared to give harbourage in her mind to Love,
               who for some time had sought to gain entrance there by means of
               the gracious deeds and words of a young man of her own order that
               went about distributing wool to spin for his master, a wool-monger.
               Love being thus, with the pleasant image of her beloved Pasquino,
               admitted into her soul, mightily did she yearn, albeit she hazarded no
               advance, and heaved a thousand sighs fiercer than fire with every
               skein of yarn that she wound upon her spindle, while she called to
               mind who he was that had given her that wool to spin. 
               Pasquino
               on his part became, meanwhile, very anxious that his master's wool
               should be well spun, and most particularly about that which Simona
               span, as if, indeed, it and it alone was to furnish forth the whole of
               the cloth. And so, what with the anxiety which the one evinced,
               and the gratification that it afforded to the other, it befell that, the
               one waxing unusually bold, and the other casting off not a little
               of her wonted shyness and reserve, they came to an understanding
               for their mutual solace; which proved so delightful to both, that
               neither waited to be bidden by the other, but 'twas rather which
               should be the first to make the overture.
            </p>
            <p>While thus they sped their days in an even tenor of delight, and
               ever grew more ardently enamoured of one another, Pasquino
               chanced to say to Simona that he wished of all things she would
               contrive how she might betake her to a garden, whither he would
               bring her, that there they might be more at their ease, and in greater
               security. Simona said that she was agreeable; and, having given her
               father to understand that she was minded to go to <span class="place">San Gallo</span> for the
               pardoning, she hied her with one of her gossips, <span class="person">Lagina</span> by name, to
               the garden of which Pasquino had told her. Here she found
               Pasquino awaiting her with a friend, one Puccino, otherwise Stramba;
               and Stramba and <span class="person">Lagina</span> falling at once to love-making, Pasquino
               and Simona left a part of the garden to them, and withdrew to
               another part for their own solace.
            </p>
            <p>Now there was in their part of the garden a very fine and lovely
               sage-bush, at foot of which they sat them down and made merry
               together a great while, and talked much of a junketing they meant
               to have in the garden quite at their ease. By and by Pasquino,
               turning to the great sage-bush, plucked therefrom a leaf, and fell to
               rubbing his teeth and gums therewith, saying that sage was an
               excellent detergent of aught that remained upon them after a meal.
               Having done so, he returned to the topic of the junketing of which
               he had spoken before. But he had not pursued it far before his
               countenance entirely changed, and forthwith he lost sight and speech,
               and shortly after died. Whereupon Simona fell a weeping and
               shrieking and calling Stramba and <span class="person">Lagina</span>; who, notwithstanding
               they came up with all speed, found Pasquino not only dead but
               already swollen from head to foot, and covered with black spots both
               on the face and on the body; whereupon Stramba broke forth
               with: Ah! wicked woman! thou hast poisoned him; 
               and made
               such a din that 'twas heard by not a few that dwelt hard by the
               garden; who also hasted to the spot, and seeing Pasquino dead and
               swollen, and hearing Stramba bewail himself and accuse Simona of
               having maliciously poisoned him, while she, all but beside herself for
               grief to be thus suddenly bereft of her lover, knew not how to defend
               herself, did all with one accord surmise that 'twas even as Stramba
               said. Wherefore they laid hands on her, and brought her, still
               weeping bitterly, to the palace of the Podestà: where at the instant
               suit of Stramba, backed by Atticciato and <span class="person">Malagevole</span>, two other
               newly-arrived friends of Pasquino, a judge forthwith addressed himself
               to question her of the matter; and being unable to discover
               that she had used any wicked practice, or was guilty, he resolved to
               take her with him and go see the corpse, and the place, and the
               manner of the death, as she had recounted it to him; for by her
               words he could not well understand it. So, taking care that there
               should be no disturbance, he had her brought to the place where
               Pasquino's corpse lay swollen like a tun, whither he himself presently
               came, and marvelling as he examined the corpse, asked her
               how the death had come about. Whereupon, standing by the sagebush,
               she told him all that had happened, and that he might perfectly
               apprehend the occasion of the death, she did as Pasquino had
               done, plucked one of the leaves from the bush, and rubbed her teeth
               with it. Whereupon Stramba and Atticciato, and the rest of the
               friends and comrades of Pasquino, making in the presence of the
               judge open mock of what she did, as an idle and vain thing, and
               being more than ever instant to affirm her guilt, and to demand the
               fire as the sole condign penalty, the poor creature, that, between
               grief for her lost lover and dread of the doom demanded by Stramba,
               stood mute and helpless, was stricken no less suddenly, and in the
               same manner, and for the same cause (to wit, that she had rubbed
               her teeth with the sage leaf) as Pasquino, to the no small amazement
               of all that were present.
            </p>
            <p>Oh! happy souls for whom one and the same day was the
               term of ardent love and earthly life! Happier still, if to the
               same bourn ye fared! Ay, and even yet more happy, if love
               there be in the other world, and there, even as here, ye love!
               But happiest above all Simona, so far as we, whom she has left
               behind, may judge, in that Fortune brooked not that the witness of
               Stramba, Atticciato and <span class="person">Malagevole</span>, carders, perchance, or yet viler
               fellows, should bear down her innocence, but found a more seemly
               issue, and, appointing her a like lot with her lover, gave her at once
               to clear herself from their foul accusation, and to follow whither the
               soul, that she so loved, of her Pasquino had preceded her!
            </p>
            <p>The judge, and all else that witnessed the event, remained long
               time in a sort of stupefaction, knowing not what to say of it; but at
               length recovering his wits, the judge said: 'Twould seem that
               this sage is poisonous, which the sage is not used to be. Let it be
               cut down to the roots and burned, lest another suffer by it in like
               sort.
               Which the gardener proceeding to do in the judge's presence, no sooner
               had he brought the great bush down, than the cause of the deaths of
               the two lovers plainly appeared: for underneath it was a toad of prodigious
               dimensions, from whose venomous breath, as they conjectured,
               the whole of the bush had contracted a poisonous quality. Around
               which toad, none venturing to approach it, they set a stout ring-fence
               of faggots, and burned it together with the sage. So ended Master
               Judge's inquest on the death of hapless Pasquino, 
               who with his
               Simona, swollen as they were, were buried by Stramba, Atticciato,
               Guccio Imbratta, and <span class="person">Malagevole</span> in the church of <span class="place">San Paolo</span>, of
               which, as it so happened, they were parishioners.

            <p>Know, then, that, as 'tis related by them of old time, there was
               once in our city a very great and wealthy merchant, Leonardo
               Sighieri by name, who had by his lady a son named Girolamo, after
               whose birth he departed this life, leaving his affairs in meet and due
               order; and well and faithfully were they afterwards administered in
               the interest of the boy by his mother and guardians. 
               As he grew
               up, consorting more frequently with the neighbours' children than
               any others of the quarter, he made friends with a girl of his own
               age that was the daughter of a tailor; and in course of time this
               friendship ripened into a love so great and vehement, that Girolamo
               was ever ill at ease when he saw her not; nor was her love for him
               a whit less strong than his for her. Which his mother perceiving
               would not seldom chide him therefor and chastise him. And as
               Girolamo could not give it up, she confided her distress to his
               guardians, speaking--for by reason of her boy's great wealth she
               thought to make, as it were, an orange-tree out of a bramble--on
               this wise: 
               This boy of ours, who is now scarce fourteen years
               old, is so in love with a daughter of one of our neighbours, a
               tailor--Salvestra
               is the girl's name--that, if we part them not, he will, peradventure,
               none else witting, take her to wife some day, and I shall
               never be happy again; or, if he see her married to another, he will
               pine away; to prevent which, methinks, you would do well to send
               him away to distant parts on the affairs of the shop; for so, being
               out of sight she will come at length to be out of mind, and then we
               can give him some well-born girl to wife. 
               Whereto the guardians
               answered, that 'twas well said, and that it should be so done to the
               best of their power: so they called the boy into the shop, and one
               of them began talking to him very affectionately on this wise:
               My son, thou art now almost grown up; 'twere well thou shouldst
               now begin to learn something for thyself of thy own affairs: wherefore
               we should be very well pleased if thou wert to go stay at <span class="place">Paris</span>
               a while, where thou wilt see how we trade with not a little of thy
               wealth, besides which thou wilt there become a much better, finer,
               and more complete gentleman than thou couldst here, and when
               thou hast seen the lords and barons and seigneurs that are there in
               plenty, and hast acquired their manners, thou canst return hither.
               The boy listened attentively, and then answered shortly that he
               would have none of it, for he supposed he might remain at <span class="place">Florence</span>
               as well as another. Whereupon the worthy men plied him with fresh
               argument, but were unable to elicit other answer from him, and
               told his mother so. Whereat she was mightily incensed, and gave
               him a great scolding, not for his refusing to go to <span class="place">Paris</span>, but for his
               love; which done, she plied him with soft, wheedling words, and
               endearing expressions and gentle entreaties that he would be pleased
               to do as his guardians would have him; whereby at length she prevailed
               so far, that he consented to go to <span class="place">Paris</span> for a year and no more;
               and so 'twas arranged. To <span class="place">Paris</span> accordingly our ardent lover went,
               and there under one pretext or another was kept for two years. He
               returned more in love than ever, to find his Salvestra married to a
               good youth that was a tent-maker; whereat his mortification knew
               no bounds. But, seeing that what must be must be, he sought to
               compose his mind; and, having got to know where she lived, he
               took to crossing her path, according to the wont of young men in
               love, thinking that she could no more have forgotten him than he
               her. 'Twas otherwise, however; she remembered him no more
               than if she had never seen him; or, if she had any recollection of
               him, she dissembled it: whereof the young man was very soon ware,
               to his extreme sorrow. Nevertheless he did all that he could to
               recall himself to her mind; but, as thereby he seemed to be nothing
               advantaged, he made up his mind, though he should die for it, to
               speak to her himself. So, being instructed as to her house by a neighbour,
               he entered it privily one evening when she and her husband
               were gone to spend the earlier hours with some neighbours, and hid
               himself in her room behind some tent-cloths that were stretched
               there, and waited till they were come back, and gone to bed, and he
               knew the husband to be asleep. Whereupon he got him to the
               place where he had seen Salvestra lie down, and said as he gently
               laid his hand upon her bosom: O my soul, art thou yet asleep?
               The girl was awake, and was on the point of uttering a cry, when
               he forestalled her, saying: Hush! for God's sake. I am thy
               Girolamo. 
               Whereupon she, trembling in every limb: Nay, but
               for God's sake, Girolamo, begone: 'tis past, the time of our childhood,
               when our love was excusable. Thou seest I am married;
               wherefore 'tis no longer seemly that I should care for any other man
               than my husband, and so by the one God, I pray thee, begone; for,
               if my husband were to know that thou art here, the least evil that
               could ensue would be that I should never more be able to live with
               him in peace or comfort, whereas, having his love, I now pass my
               days with him in tranquil happiness. 
               Which speech caused the
               young man grievous distress; but 'twas in vain that he reminded
               her of the past, and of his love that distance had not impaired, and
               therewith mingled many a prayer and the mightiest protestations.
               
               Wherefore, yearning for death, he besought her at last that she would
               suffer him to lie a while beside her till he got some heat, for he was
               chilled through and through, waiting for her, and promised her that
               he would say never a word to her, nor touch her, and that as soon
               as he was a little warmed he would go away. 
               On which terms
               Salvestra, being not without pity for him, granted his request. So
               the young man lay down beside her, and touched her not; but,
               gathering up into one thought the love he had so long borne her,
               the harshness with which she now requited it, and his ruined hopes,
               resolved to live no longer, and in a convulsion, without a word, and
               with fists clenched, expired by her side.
            </p>
            <p>After a while the girl, marvelling at his continence, and fearing
               lest her husband should awake, broke silence, saying: Nay, but,
               Girolamo, why goest thou not? 
               But, receiving no answer, she
               supposed that he slept. Wherefore, reaching forth her hand to
               arouse him, she touched him and found him to her great surprise
               cold as ice; and touching him again and again somewhat rudely, and
               still finding that he did not stir, she knew that he was dead. Her
               grief was boundless, and 'twas long before she could bethink her how
               to act. But at last she resolved to sound her husband's mind as to
               what should be done in such a case without disclosing that 'twas his
               own. So she awakened him, and told him how he was then bested,
               as if it were the affair of another, and then asked him, if such a thing
               happened to her, what course he would take. 
               The good man
               answered that he should deem it best to take the dead man privily
               home, and there leave him, bearing no grudge against the lady, who
               seemed to have done no wrong. 
               And even so, said his wife, it
               is for us to do; and taking his hand, she laid it on the corpse.
               Whereat he started up in consternation, and struck a light, and without
               further parley with his wife, clapped the dead man's clothes
               upon him, and forthwith (confident in his own innocence) raised
               him on his shoulders, and bore him to the door of his house, where
               he set him down and left him.
            </p>
            <p>Day came, and the dead man being found before his own door,
               there was a great stir made, particularly by his mother; the body
               was examined with all care from head to foot, and, no wound or trace
               of violence being found on it, the physicians were on the whole of
               opinion that, as the fact was, the man had died of grief. So the corpse
               was borne to a church, and thither came the sorrowing mother and
               other ladies, her kinswomen and neighbours, and began to wail and
               mourn over it without restraint after our Florentine fashion. 
               And
               when the wailing had reached its height, the good man, in whose
               house the death had occurred, said to Salvestra: Go wrap a
               mantle about thy head, and hie thee to the church, whither Girolamo
               has been taken, and go about among the women and list what
               they say of this matter, and I will do the like among the men, that
               we may hear if aught be said to our disadvantage. 
               The girl
               assented, for with tardy tenderness she now yearned to look on him
               dead, whom living she would not solace with a single kiss, and so to
               the church she went. Ah! how marvellous to whoso ponders it, is
               the might of Love, and how unsearchable his ways! That heart,
               which, while Fortune smiled on Girolamo, had remained sealed to
               him, opened to him now that he was fordone, and, kindling anew
               with all its old flame, melted with such compassion that no sooner
               saw she his dead face, as there she stood wrapped in her mantle,
               than, edging her way forward through the crowd of women, she
               stayed not till she was beside the corpse; and there, uttering a piercing
               shriek, she threw herself upon the dead youth, and as her face
               met his, and before she might drench it with her tears, grief that had
               reft life from him had even so reft it from her.
            </p>
            <p>The women strove to comfort her, and bade her raise herself a
               little, for as yet they knew her not; then, as she did not arise, they
               would have helped her, but found her stiff and stark, and so, raising
               her up, they in one and the same moment saw her to be Salvestra
               and dead. Whereat all the women that were there, overborne by
               a redoubled pity, broke forth in wailing new and louder far than
               before. From the church the bruit spread itself among the men,
               and reached the ears of Salvestra's husband, who, deaf to all that
               offered comfort or consolation, wept a long while; after which he
               told to not a few that were there what had passed in the night
               between the youth and his wife; and so 'twas known of all how
               they came to die, to the common sorrow of all. 
               So they took the
               dead girl, and arrayed her as they are wont to array the dead, and
               laid her on the same bed beside the youth, and long time they
               mourned her: then were they both buried in the same tomb, and
               thus those, whom love had not been able to wed in life, were wedded
               by death in indissoluble union.

            <p>You are to know, then, that, as the Provençals relate, there
               were once in <span class="place">Provence</span> two noble knights, each having castles and
               vassals under him, the one yclept Sieur Guillaume de Roussillon,
               and the other Sieur Guillaume de Cabestaing;Boccaccio writes
               <span class="place">Guardastagno</span>, but the troubadour, Cabestaing, or
               	Cabestany, is the hero of the story. and being both
               most doughty warriors, they were as brothers, and went ever together,
               and bearing the same device, to tournament or joust, or
               other passage of arms. And, albeit each dwelt in his own castle,
               and the castles were ten good miles apart, it nevertheless came to
               pass that, Sieur Guillaume de Roussillon having a most lovely lady,
               and amorous withal, to wife, Sieur Guillaume de Cabestaing, for all
               they were such friends and comrades, became inordinately enamoured
               of the lady, who, by this, that, and the other sign that he gave,
               discovered
               his passion, and knowing him for a most complete knight,
               was flattered, and returned it, insomuch that she yearned and burned
               for him above all else in the world, and waited only till he should
               make his suit to her, as before long he did; and so they met from
               time to time, and great was their love. Which intercourse they
               ordered with so little discretion that 'twas discovered by the husband,
               who was very wroth, insomuch that the great love which he bore to
               Cabestaing was changed into mortal enmity; and, dissembling it
               better than the lovers their love, he made his mind up to kill Cabestaing.
               Now it came to pass that, while Roussillon was in this
               frame, a great tourney was proclaimed in <span class="place">France</span>, whereof Roussillon
               forthwith sent word to Cabestaing, and bade him to his castle, so he
               were minded to come, that there they might discuss whether (or no)
               to go to the tourney, and how. Cabestaing was overjoyed, and
               made answer that he would come to sup with him next day without
               fail. Which message being delivered, Roussillon wist that the
               time was come to slay Cabestaing. So next day he armed himself,
               and, attended by a few servants, took horse, and about a mile from
               his castle lay in ambush in a wood through which Cabestaing must
               needs pass. He waited some time, and then he saw Cabestaing
               approach unarmed with two servants behind, also unarmed, for he
               was without thought of peril on Roussillon's part. So Cabestaing
               came on to the place of Roussillon's choice, and then, fell and vengeful,
               Roussillon leapt forth lance in hand, and fell upon him, exclaiming:
               Thou art a dead man! and the words were no sooner
               spoken than the lance was through Cabestaing's breast. 
               Powerless
               either to defend himself or even utter a cry, Cabestaing fell to the
               ground, and soon expired. His servants waited not to see who had
               done the deed, but turned their horses' heads and fled with all speed
               to their lord's castle. Roussillon dismounted, opened Cabestaing's
               breast with a knife, and took out the heart with his own hands,
               wrapped it up in a banderole, and gave it to one of his servants to
               carry: he then bade none make bold to breathe a word of the affair,
               mounted his horse and rode back--'twas now night--to his castle.
               The lady, who had been told that Cabestaing was to come to supper
               that evening, and was all impatience till he should come, was greatly
               surprised to see her husband arrive without him. Wherefore:
               How is this, my lord? said she. Why tarries Cabestaing?
               
               Madam, answered her husband, I have tidings from him that he
               cannot be here until to-morrow: whereat the lady was somewhat
               disconcerted.
            </p>
            <p>Having dismounted, Roussillon called the cook, and said to him:
               Here is a boar's heart; take it, and make thereof the daintiest
               and most delicious dish thou canst, and when I am set at table serve
               it in a silver porringer. So the cook took the heart, and expended
               all his skill and pains upon it, mincing it and mixing with it plenty
               of good seasoning, and made thereof an excellent ragout; 
               and in due
               time Sieur Guillaume and his lady sat them down to table. The
               meat was served, but Sieur Guillaume, his mind engrossed with his
               crime, ate but little. The cook set the ragout before him, but he,
               feigning that he cared to eat no more that evening, had it passed on
               to the lady, and highly commended it. The lady, nothing loath,
               took some of it, and found it so good that she ended by eating the
               whole. Whereupon: Madam, quoth the knight, how liked
               you this dish? 
               In good faith, my lord, replied the lady, not
               a little. 
               So help me, God, returned the knight, I dare be
               sworn you did; 'tis no wonder that you should enjoy that dead, which
               living you enjoyed more than aught else in the world. 
               For a while
               the lady was silent; then: How say you? said she; what is
               this you have caused me to eat? 
               That which you have eaten,
               replied the knight, was in good sooth the heart of Sieur Guillaume
               de Cabestaing, whom you, disloyal woman that you are, did so much
               love: for assurance whereof I tell you that but a short while before
               I came back, I plucked it from his breast with my own hands. 
               It
               boots not to ask if the lady was sorrow-stricken to receive such tidings
               of her best beloved. But after a while she said: 'Twas the deed
               of a disloyal and recreant knight; for if I, unconstrained by him, made
               him lord of my love, and thereby did you wrong, 'twas I, not he,
               should have borne the penalty. But God forbid that fare of such
               high excellence as the heart of a knight so true and courteous as Sieur
               Guillaume de Cabestaing be followed by aught else. 
               So saying she
               started to her feet, and stepping back to a window that was behind
               her, without a moment's hesitation let herself drop backwards
               therefrom. The window was at a great height from the ground, so
               that the lady was not only killed by the fall, but almost reduced to
               atoms. Stunned and conscience-stricken by the spectacle, and fearing
               the vengeance of the country folk, and the Count of <span class="place">Provence</span>,
               Sieur Guillaume had his horses saddled and rode away. 
               On the
               morrow the whole countryside knew how the affair had come about;
               wherefore folk from both of the castles took the two bodies, and bore
               them with grief and lamentation exceeding great to the church in the
               lady's castle, and laid them in the same tomb, and caused verses to
               be inscribed thereon signifying who they were that were there
               interred, and the manner and occasion of their death.

            <p>You are to know, then, fairest my damsels, that 'tis not long
               since there dwelt at <span class="place">Salerno</span> a leech most eminent in surgery, his
               name, Master Mazzeo della Montagna, who in his extreme old age
               took to wife a fair damsel of the same city, whom he kept in nobler
               and richer array of dresses and jewels, and all other finery that the
               sex affects, than any other lady in <span class="place">Salerno</span>. Howbeit, she was none
               too warm most of her time, being ill covered abed by the doctor;
               
               who gave her to understand--even as Messer Ricciardo di Chinzica,
               of whom we spoke a while since, taught his lady the feasts--that for
               once that a man lay with a woman he needed I know not how
               many days to recover, and the like nonsense: whereby she lived as
               ill content as might be; and, lacking neither sense nor spirit, she
               determined to economize at home, and taking to the street, to live
               at others' expense. So, having passed in review divers young men,
               she at last found one that was to her mind, on whom she set all her
               heart and hopes of happiness. Which the gallant perceiving was
               mightily flattered, and in like manner gave her all his love. 
               Ruggieri
               da Jeroli--such was the gallant's name--was of noble birth, but of
               life and conversation so evil and reprehensible that kinsman or
               friend he had none left that wished him well, or cared to see him;
               and all <span class="place">Salerno</span> knew him for a common thief and rogue of the vilest
               character. Whereof the lady took little heed, having a mind to him
               for another reason; and so with the help of her maid she arranged
               a meeting with him. But after they had solaced themselves a while,
               the lady began to censure his past life, and to implore him for love
               of her to depart from such evil ways; and to afford him the means
               thereto, she from time to time furnished him with money. 
               While
               thus with all discretion they continued their intercourse, it chanced
               that a man halt of one of his legs was placed under the leech's care.
               The leech saw what was amiss with him, and told his kinsfolk, that,
               unless a gangrened bone that he had in his leg were taken out, he
               must die, or have the whole leg amputated; that if the bone were
               removed he might recover; but that otherwise he would not answer
               for his life: whereupon the relatives assented that the bone should
               be removed, and left the patient in the hands of the leech; 
               who,
               deeming that by reason of the pain 'twas not possible for him to
               endure the treatment without an opiate, caused to be distilled in the
               morning a certain water of his own concoction, whereby the patient,
               drinking it, might be ensured sleep during such time as he deemed
               the operation, which he meant to perform about vespers, would
               occupy. In the meantime he had the water brought into his house,
               and set it in the window of his room, telling no one what it was.
               But when the vesper hour was come, and the leech was about to
               visit his patient, a messenger arrived from some very great friends of
               his at <span class="place">Amalfi</span>, bearing tidings of a great riot there had been there, in
               which not a few had been wounded, and bidding him on no account
               omit to hie him thither forthwith. 
               Wherefore the leech put off
               the treatment of the leg to the morrow, and took boat to <span class="place">Amalfi</span>;
               and the lady, knowing that he would not return home that night,
               did as she was wont in such a case, to wit, brought Ruggieri in
               privily, and locked him in her chamber until certain other folk that
               were in the house were gone to sleep. Ruggieri, then, being thus in
               the chamber, awaiting the lady, and having--whether it were that
               he had had a fatiguing day, or eaten something salt, or, perchance,
               that 'twas his habit of body--a mighty thirst, glancing at the window,
               caught sight of the bottle containing the water which the leech had
               prepared for the patient, and taking it to be drinking water, set it
               to his lips and drank it all, and in no long time fell into a deep
               sleep.
            </p>
            <p>So soon as she was able the lady hied her to the room, and there
               finding Ruggieri asleep, touched him and softly told him to get up:
               to no purpose, however; he neither answered nor stirred a limb.
               Wherefore the lady, rather losing patience, applied somewhat more
               force, and gave him a push, saying: Get up, sleepy-head; if
               thou hadst a mind to sleep, thou shouldst have gone home, and not
               have come hither. Thus pushed Ruggieri fell down from a box
               on which he lay, and, falling, shewed no more sign of animation
               than if he had been a corpse. The lady, now somewhat alarmed,
               essayed to lift him, and shook him roughly, and took him by the nose,
               and pulled him by the beard; again to no purpose: he had tethered
               his ass to a stout pin. So the lady began to fear he must be dead:
               however, she went on to pinch him shrewdly, and singe him with the
               flame of a candle; but when these methods also failed she, being, for
               all she was a leech's wife, no leech herself, believed for sure that he
               was dead; and as there was nought in the world that she loved so
               much, it boots not to ask if she was sore distressed; wherefore
               silently, for she dared not lament aloud, she began to weep over him
               and bewail such a misadventure. But, after a while, fearing lest her
               loss should not be without a sequel of shame, she bethought her that
               she must contrive without delay to get the body out of the house;
               and standing in need of another's advice, she quietly summoned her
               maid, shewed her the mishap that had befallen her, and craved her
               counsel. Whereat the maid marvelled not a little; and she too fell
               to pulling Ruggieri this way and that, and pinching him, and, as she
               found no sign of life in him, concurred with her mistress that he was
               verily dead, and advised her to remove him from the house. 
               And
               where, said the lady, shall we put him, that to-morrow, when he
               is discovered, it be not suspected that 'twas hence he was carried?
               Madam, answered the maid, late last evening I marked in front
               of our neighbour the carpenter's shop a chest, not too large, which,
               if he have not put it back in the house, will come in very handy
               for our purpose, for we will put him inside, and give him two or
               three cuts with a knife, and so leave him. When he is found, I
               know not why it should be thought that 'twas from this house rather
               than from any other that he was put there; nay, as he was an evilliver,
               'twill more likely be supposed, that, as he hied him on some
               evil errand, some enemy slew him, and then put him in the chest.
               The lady said there was nought in the world she might so ill brook
               as that Ruggieri should receive any wound; but with that exception
               she approved her maid's proposal, and sent her to see if the chest
               were still where she had seen it. The maid, returning, reported
               that there it was, and, being young and strong, got Ruggieri, with
               the lady's help, upon her shoulders; and so the lady, going before
               to espy if any folk came that way, and the maid following, they
               came to the chest, and having laid Ruggieri therein, closed it and
               left him there.
            </p>
            <p>Now a few days before, two young men, that were usurers, had
               taken up their quarters in a house a little further on: they had seen
               the chest during the day, and being short of furniture, and having
               a mind to make great gain with little expenditure, they had resolved
               that, if it were still there at night, they would take it home with
               them. So at midnight forth they hied them, and finding the chest,
               were at no pains to examine it closely, but forthwith, though it
               seemed somewhat heavy, bore it off to their house, and set it down
               beside a room in which their women slept; and without being at
               pains to adjust it too securely they left it there for the time, and
               went to bed.
            </p>
            <p>Towards matins Ruggieri, having had a long sleep and digested
               the draught and exhausted its efficacy, awoke, but albeit his slumber
               was broken, and his senses had recovered their powers, yet his brain
               remained in a sort of torpor which kept him bemused for some days;
               and when he opened his eyes and saw nothing, and stretched his
               hands hither and thither and found himself in the chest, it was with
               difficulty that he collected his thoughts. 
               How is this? he said to
               himself. Where am I? Do I sleep or wake? I remember
               coming this evening to my lady's chamber; and now it seems I am
               in a chest. What means it? Can the leech have returned, or
               somewhat else have happened that caused the lady, while I slept, to
               hide me here? That was it, I suppose. Without a doubt it must
               have been so. 
               And having come to this conclusion, he composed
               himself to listen, if haply he might hear something, and being somewhat
               ill at ease in the chest, which was none too large, and the side
               on which he lay paining him, he must needs turn over to the other,
               and did so with such adroitness that, bringing his loins smartly
               against one of the sides of the chest, which was set on an uneven
               floor, he caused it to tilt and then fall; and such was the noise that
               it made as it fell that the women that slept there awoke, albeit for
               fear they kept silence. Ruggieri was not a little disconcerted by the
               fall, but, finding that thereby the chest was come open, he judged
               that, happen what might, he would be better out of it than in it;
               and not knowing where he was, and being otherwise at his wits' end,
               he began to grope about the house, if haply he might find a stair or
               door whereby he might take himself off. Hearing him thus groping
               his way, the alarmed women gave tongue with: Who is there?
               Ruggieri, not knowing the voice, made no answer: wherefore the
               women fell to calling the two young men, who, having had a long
               day, were fast asleep, and heard nought of what went on. 
               Which
               served to increase the fright of the women, who rose and got them
               to divers windows, and raised the cry: Take thief, take thief!
               At which summons there came running from divers quarters not a
               few of the neighbours, who got into the house by the roof or otherwise
               as each best might: likewise the young men, aroused by the
               din, got up; and, Ruggieri being now all but beside himself for sheer
               amazement, and knowing not whither to turn him to escape them,
               they took him and delivered him to the officers of the Governor of
               the city, who, hearing the uproar, had hasted to the spot. And so
               he was brought before the Governor, who, knowing him to be held
               of all a most arrant evil-doer, put him forthwith to the torture, and,
               upon his confessing that he had entered the house of the usurers with
               intent to rob, was minded to make short work of it, and have him
               hanged by the neck.
            </p>
            <p>In the morning 'twas bruited throughout all <span class="place">Salerno</span> that
               Ruggieri had been taken a thieving in the house of the usurers.
               Whereat the lady and her maid were all amazement and bewilderment,
               insomuch that they were within an ace of persuading themselves
               that what they had done the night before they had not done,
               but had only dreamed it; besides which, the peril in which Ruggieri
               stood caused the lady such anxiety as brought her to the verge
               of madness. Shortly after half tierce the leech, being returned
               from <span class="place">Amalfi</span>, and minded now to treat his patient, called for his
               water, and finding the bottle empty made a great commotion, protesting
               that nought in his house could be let alone. The lady,
               having other cause of annoy, lost temper, and said: What would
               you say, Master, of an important matter, when you raise such a din
               because a bottle of water has been upset? Is there never another to
               be found in the world? 
               Madam, replied the leech, thou takest
               this to have been mere water: 'twas no such thing, but an artificial
               water of a soporiferous virtue; and he told her for what purpose he
               had made it. Which the lady no sooner heard, than, guessing that
               Ruggieri had drunk it, and so had seemed to them to be dead, she
               said: Master, we knew it not; wherefore make you another.
               And so the leech, seeing that there was no help for it, had another
               made. Not long after, the maid, who by the lady's command had
               gone to find out what folk said of Ruggieri, returned, saying:
               Madam, of Ruggieri they say nought but evil, nor, by what I have
               been able to discover, has he friend or kinsman that has or will come
               to his aid; and 'tis held for certain that to-morrow the StadicThe
               Neapolitan term for the chief of police. will
               have him hanged. Besides which, I have that to tell you which will
               surprise you; for, methinks, I have found out how he came into the
               usurers' house. List, then, how it was: you know the carpenter in
               front of whose shop stood the chest we put Ruggieri into: he had
               to-day the most violent altercation in the world with one to whom
               it would seem the chest belongs, by whom he was required to make
               good the value of the chest, to which he made answer that he had
               not sold it, but that it had been stolen from him in the night. 
               'Not
               so,' said the other; 'thou soldst it to the two young usurers, as they
               themselves told me last night, when I saw it in their house at the
               time Ruggieri was taken.' 'They lie,' replied the carpenter. 'I
               never sold it them, but they must have stolen it from me last night;
               go we to them.' So with one accord off they went to the usurers'
               house, and I came back here. And so, you see, I make out that
               'twas on such wise that Ruggieri was brought where he was found;
               but how he came to life again, I am at a loss to conjecture. 
               The lady
               now understood exactly how things were, and accordingly told the
               maid what she had learned from the leech, and besought her to aid
               her to get Ruggieri off, for so she might, if she would, and at the
               same time preserve her honour. Madam, said the maid, do but
               shew me how; and glad shall I be to do just as you wish. 
               Whereupon
               the lady, to whom necessity taught invention, formed her plan
               on the spur of the moment, and expounded it in detail to the maid;
               who (as the first step) hied her to the leech, and, weeping, thus
               addressed him: Sir, it behoves me to ask your pardon of a great
               wrong that I have done you. 
               And what may that be? inquired the leech. 
               Sir, said the maid, who ceased not to weep, you
               know what manner of man is Ruggieri da Jeroli. Now he took a
               fancy to me, and partly for fear, partly for love, I this year agreed to
               be his mistress; and knowing yestereve that you were from home,
               he coaxed me into bringing him into your house to sleep with me in
               my room. Now he was athirst, and I, having no mind to be seen
               by your lady, who was in the hall, and knowing not whither I might
               sooner betake me for wine or water, bethought me that I had seen a
               bottle of water in your room, and ran and fetched it, and gave it him
               to drink, and then put the bottle back in the place whence I had
               taken it; touching which I find that you have made a great stir in
               the house. Verily I confess that I did wrong; but who is there
               that does not wrong sometimes? Sorry indeed am I to have so done,
               but 'tis not for such a cause and that which ensued thereon that
               Ruggieri should lose his life. Wherefore, I do most earnestly
               beseech you, pardon me, and suffer me to go help him as best I may
               be able. 
               Wroth though he was at what he heard, the leech replied
               in a bantering tone: Thy pardon thou hast by thine own deed;
               for, whereas thou didst last night think to have with thee a gallant
               that would thoroughly dust thy pelisse for thee, he was but a
               sleepyhead;
               wherefore get thee gone, and do what thou mayst for the
               deliverance of thy lover, and for the future look thou bring him not
               into the house; else I will pay thee for that turn and this to boot.
               The maid, deeming that she had come off well in the first brush,
               hied her with all speed to the prison where Ruggieri lay, and by her
               cajoleries prevailed upon the warders to let her speak with him; and
               having told him how he must answer the Stadic if he would get off,
               she succeeded in obtaining preaudience of the Stadic; 
               who, seeing
               that the baggage was lusty and mettlesome, was minded before he
               heard her to grapple her with the hook, to which she was by no
               means averse, knowing that such a preliminary would secure her a
               better hearing. When she had undergone the operation and was
               risen: Sir, said she, you have here Ruggieri da Jeroli,
               apprehended
               on a charge of theft; which charge is false. 
               Whereupon she
               told him the whole story from beginning to end, how she, being
               Ruggieri's mistress, had brought him into the leech's house and had
               given him the opiate, not knowing it for such, and taking him to be
               dead, had put him in the chest; and then recounting what she had
               heard pass between the carpenter and the owner of the chest, she
               shewed him how Ruggieri came into the house of the usurers.
               Seeing that 'twas easy enough to find out whether the story were
               true, the Stadic began by questioning the leech as to the water, and
               found that 'twas as she had said: he then summoned the carpenter,
               the owner of the chest and the usurers, and after much further
               parley ascertained that the usurers had stolen the chest during the
               night, and brought it into their house: finally he sent for Ruggieri,
               and asked him where he had lodged that night, to which Ruggieri
               answered that where he had lodged he knew not, but he well
               remembered going to pass the night with Master Mazzeo's maid, in
               whose room he had drunk some water by reason of a great thirst
               that he had; but what happened to him afterwards, except that, when
               he awoke, he found himself in a chest in the house of the usurers, he
               knew not. All which matters the Stadic heard with great interest,
               and caused the maid and Ruggieri and the carpenter and the
               usurers to rehearse them several times. In the end, seeing that
               Ruggieri was innocent, he released him, and mulcted the usurers in
               fifteen ounces for the theft of the chest. How glad Ruggieri was
               thus to escape, it boots not to ask; and glad beyond measure was his
               lady. And so, many a time did they laugh and make merry
               together over the affair, she and he and the dear maid that had
               proposed to give him a taste of the knife; and remaining constant in
               their love, they had ever better and better solace thereof. The like
               whereof befall me, sans the being put in the chest.

            <h3 class="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Heartsore as the gentle ladies had been made by the preceding
               stories, this last of <span class="person">Dioneo</span> provoked them to such merriment, more
               especially the passage about the Stadic and the hook, that they lacked
               not relief of the piteous mood engendered by the others. 
               But the
               king observing that the sun was now taking a yellowish tinge, and
               that the end of his sovereignty was come, in terms most courtly
               made his excuse to the fair ladies, that he had made so direful a
               theme as lovers' infelicity the topic of their discourse; after which,
               he rose, took the laurel wreath from his head, and, while the ladies
               watched to see to whom he would give it, set it graciously upon the
               blond head of <span class="person">Fiammetta</span>, saying: 
               Herewith I crown thee, as
               deeming that thou, better than any other, wilt know how to make
               to-morrow console our fair companions for the rude trials of to-day.
               <span class="person">Fiammetta</span>, whose wavy tresses fell in a flood of gold over her white
               and delicate shoulders, whose softly rounded face was all radiant
               with the very tints of the white lily blended with the red of the
               rose, who carried two eyes in her head that matched those of a
               peregrine falcon, while her tiny sweet mouth shewed a pair of lips
               that shone as rubies, replied with a smile: 
               And gladly take I the
               wreath, <span class="person">Filostrato</span>, and that thou mayst more truly understand what
               thou hast done, 'tis my present will and pleasure that each make
               	ready to discourse to-morrow of good fortune befalling lovers after
               divers direful or disastrous adventures. 
               The theme propounded was
               approved by all; whereupon the queen called the seneschal, and
               having made with him all meet arrangements, rose and gaily dismissed
               all the company until the supper hour; wherefore, some
               straying about the garden, the beauties of which were not such
               as soon to pall, others bending their steps towards the mills that
               were grinding without, each, as and where it seemed best, they took
               meanwhile their several pleasures. The supper hour come, they all
               gathered, in their wonted order, by the fair fountain, and in the
               gayest of spirits and well served they supped. Then rising they
               addressed them, as was their wont, to dance and song, and while
               <span class="person">Filomena</span> led the dance: 
               <span class="person">Filostrato</span>, said the queen, being
               minded to follow in the footsteps of our predecessors, and that, as
               by their, so by our command a song be sung; and well witting that
               thy songs are even as thy stories, to the end that no day but this be
               vexed with thy misfortunes, we ordain that thou give us one of
               them, whichever thou mayst prefer. 
               <span class="person">Filostrato</span> answered that he
               would gladly do so; and without delay began to sing on this wise:
            </p>
            <div class="song">
               	Full well my tears attest,
               	O traitor Love, with what just cause the heart,
               	With which thou once hast broken faith, doth smart.
               
               	Love, when thou first didst in my heart enshrine
               	Her for whom still I sigh, alas! in vain,
               	Nor any hope do know,
               	A damsel so complete thou didst me shew,
               	That light as air I counted every pain,
               	Wherewith behest of thine
               	Condemned my soul to pine.
               	Ah! but I gravely erred; the which to know
               	Too late, alas! doth but enhance my woe.
               
               	The cheat I knew not ere she did me leave,
               	She, she, in whom alone my hopes were placed:
               	For 'twas when I did most
               	Flatter myself with hope, and proudly boast
               	Myself her vassal lowliest and most graced,
               	Nor thought Love might bereave,
               	Nor dreamed he e'er might grieve,
               	'Twas then I found that she another's worth
               	Into her heart had ta'en, and me cast forth.
               
               	A plant of pain, alas! my heart did bear,
               	What time my hapless self cast forth I knew;
               	And there it doth remain;
               	And day and hour I curse and curse again,
               	When first that front of love shone on my view
               	That front so queenly fair,
               	And bright beyond compare!
               	Wherefore at once my faith, my hope, my fire
               	My soul doth imprecate, ere she expire.
               My lord, thou knowest how comfortless my woe,
               	Thou, Love, my lord, whom thus I supplicate
               	With many a piteous moan,
               	Telling thee how in anguish sore I groan,
               	Yearning for death my pain to mitigate.
               	Come death, and with one blow
               	Cut short my span, and so
               	With my curst life me of my frenzy ease;
               	For wheresoe'er I go, 'twill sure decrease.
               
               	Save death no way of comfort doth remain:
               	No anodyne beside for this sore smart.
               	The boon, then, Love bestow;
               	And presently by death annul my woe,
               	And from this abject life release my heart.
               	Since from me joy is ta'en,
               	And every solace, deign
               	My prayer to grant, and let my death the cheer
               	Complete, that she now hath of her new fere.
               
               	Song, it may be that no one shall thee learn:
               	Nor do I care; for none I wot, so well
               	As I may chant thee; so,
               	This one behest I lay upon thee, go
               	Hie thee to Love, and him in secret tell,
               	How I my life do spurn,
               	My bitter life, and yearn,
               	That to a better harbourage he bring
               	Me, of all might and grace that own him king.
               Full well my tears attest, etc.
            </div>
            <p><span class="person">Filostrato</span>'s mood and its cause were made abundantly manifest
               by the words of this song; and perchance they had been made still
               more so by the looks of a lady that was among the dancers, had not
               the shades of night, which had now overtaken them, concealed the
               blush that suffused her face. Other songs followed until the hour
               for slumber arrived: whereupon at the behest of the queen all the
               ladies sought their several chambers.
