            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>The dawn of Sunday was already changing from vermilion to
               orange, as the sun hasted to the horizon, when the queen rose and
               roused all the company. The seneschal had early sent forward to
               their next place of sojourn ample store of things meet with folk to
               make all things ready, and now seeing the queen on the road, and
               the decampment, as it were, begun, he hastily completed the equipment
               of the baggage-train, and set off therewith, attended by the
               rest of the servants, in rear of the ladies and gentlemen. So, to the
               chant of, perhaps, a score of nightingales and other birds, the queen,
               her ladies and the three young men trooping beside or after her,
               paced leisurely westward by a path little frequented and overgrown
               with herbage and flowers, which, as they caught the sunlight, began
               one and all to unfold their petals. So fared she on with her train,
               while the quirk and the jest and the laugh passed from mouth to
               mouth; nor had they completed more than two thousand paces
               when, well before half tierce,I. e. midway between prime and
               tierce, about 7.30 a.m. they arrived at a palace most fair
               and sumptuous, which stood out somewhat from the plain, being
               situate upon a low eminence. On entering, they first traversed its
               great halls and dainty chambers furnished throughout with all brave
               and meet appointments; and finding all most commendable, they
               reputed its lord a magnifico. Then descending, they surveyed its
               spacious and cheerful court, its vaults of excellent wines and copious
               springs of most cool water, and found it still more commendable.
               After which, being fain of rest, they sat them down in a gallery
               which commanded the court, and was close imbosked with leafage
               and such flowers as the season afforded, and thither the discreet
               seneschal brought comfits and wines most choice and excellent,
               wherewith they were refreshed. Whereupon they hied them to a
               walled garden adjoining the palace; which, the gate being opened,
               they entered, and wonder-struck by the beauty of the whole passed
               on to examine more attentively the several parts. It was bordered
               and traversed in many parts by alleys, each very wide and straight as
               an arrow and roofed in with trellis of vines, which gave good promise
               of bearing clusters that year, and, being all in flower, dispersed such
               fragrance throughout the garden as blended with that exhaled by
               many another plant that grew therein made the garden seem
               redolent of all the spices that ever grew in the East. The sides of
               the alleys were all, as it were, walled in with roses white and red
               and jasmine; insomuch that there was no part of the garden but one
               might walk there not merely in the morning but at high noon in
               grateful shade and fragrance, completely screened from the sun. As
               for the plants that were in the garden, 'twere long to enumerate
               them, to specify their sorts, to describe the order of their arrangement;
               enough, in brief, that there was abundance of every rarer species that
               our climate allows. In the middle of the garden, a thing not less
               but much more to be commended than aught else, was a lawn of
               the finest turf, and so green that it seemed almost black, pranked with
               flowers of, perhaps, a thousand sorts, and girt about with the richest
               living verdure of orange-trees and cedars, which shewed not only
               flowers but fruits both new and old, and were no less grateful to the
               smell by their fragrance than to the eye by their shade. In the
               middle of the lawn was a basin of whitest marble, graven with
               marvellous art; in the centre whereof--whether the spring were
               natural or artificial I know not--rose a column supporting a figure
               which sent forth a jet of water of such volume and to such an
               altitude that it fell, not without a delicious plash, into the basin in
               quantity amply sufficient to turn a mill-wheel. The overflow was
               carried away from the lawn by a hidden conduit, and then, reemerging,
               was distributed through tiny channels, very fair and
               cunningly contrived, in such sort as to flow round the entire lawn,
               and by similar derivative channels to penetrate almost every part of
               the fair garden, until, re-uniting at a certain point, it issued thence,
               and, clear as crystal, slid down towards the plain, turning by the way
               two mill-wheels with extreme velocity to the no small profit of the
               lord. The aspect of this garden, its fair order, the plants and the
               fountain and the rivulets that flowed from it, so charmed the ladies
               and the three young men that with one accord they affirmed that
               they knew not how it could receive any accession of beauty, or what
               other form could be given to Paradise, if it were to be planted on
               earth. So, excellently well pleased, they roved about it, plucking
               sprays from the trees, and weaving them into the fairest of garlands,
               while songsters of, perhaps, a score of different sorts warbled as if in
               mutual emulation, when suddenly a sight as fair and delightsome as
               novel, which, engrossed by the other beauties of the place, they had
               hitherto overlooked, met their eyes. For the garden, they now saw,
               was peopled with a host of living creatures, fair and of, perhaps, a
               hundred sorts; and they pointed out to one another how here
               emerged a cony, or there scampered a hare, or couched a goat, or
               grazed a fawn, or many another harmless, all but domesticated,
               creature roved carelessly seeking his pleasure at his own sweet will.
               All which served immensely to reinforce their already abundant
               delight. At length, however, they had enough of wandering about
               the garden and observing this thing and that: wherefore they
               repaired to the beautiful fountain, around which were ranged the
               tables, and there, after they had sung half-a-dozen songs and trod
               some measures, they sat them down, at the queen's command, to
               breakfast, which was served with all celerity and in fair and orderly
               manner, the viands being both good and delicate; whereby their
               spirits rose, and up they got, and betook themselves again to music
               and song and dance, and so sped the hours, until, as the heat increased,
               the queen deemed it time that whoso was so minded should go to
               sleep. Some there were that did so; others were too charmed by
               the beauty of the place to think of leaving it; but tarried there, and,
               while the rest slept, amused themselves with reading romances or
               playing at chess or dice. However, after none, there was a general
               lev√®e; and, with faces laved and refreshed with cold water,
               they
               gathered by the queen's command upon the lawn, and, having sat
               them down in their wonted order by the fountain, waited for the
               story-telling to begin upon the theme assigned by the queen. With
               this duty the queen first charged <span class="person">Filostrato</span>, who began on this wise.

            </div>
            <p>In this very country-side of ours there was and yet is a convent of
               women of great repute for sanctity--name it I will not, lest I should
               in some measure diminish its repute--the nuns being at the time of
               which I speak but nine in number, including the abbess, and all
               young women. Their very beautiful garden was in charge of a
               foolish fellow, who, not being content with his wage, squared
               accounts with their steward, and hied him back to <span class="place">Lamporecchio</span>,
               whence he came. Among others who welcomed him home was a
               young husbandman, Masetto by name, a stout and hardy fellow, and
               handsome for a contadino, who asked him where he had been so
               long. Nuto, as our good friend was called, told him. Masetto
               then asked how he had been employed at the convent, and Nuto
               answered: I kept their large and beautiful garden in good trim,
               and, besides, I sometimes went to the wood to fetch the faggots, I
               drew water, and did some other trifling services; but the ladies gave
               so little wage that it scarce kept me in shoes. And moreover they
               are all young, and, I think, they are one and all possessed of the
               devil, for 'tis impossible to do anything to their mind; indeed, when
               I would be at work in the kitchen-garden, 'put this here,' would say
               one, 'put that here,' would say another, and a third would snatch
               the hoe from my hand, and say, 'that is not as it should be'; and
               so they would worry me until I would give up working and go out
               of the garden; so that, what with this thing and that, I was minded
               to stay there no more, and so I am come hither. The steward asked
               me before I left to send him any one whom on my return I might
               find fit for the work, and I promised; but God bless his loins, I
               shall be at no pains to find out and send him any one.
            </p>
            <p>As Nuto thus ran on, Masetto was seized by such a desire to be
               with these nuns that he quite pined, as he gathered from what Nuto
               said that his desire might be gratified. And as that could not be,
               if he said nothing to Nuto, he remarked: Ah! 'twas well done
               of thee to come hither. A man to live with women! he might as
               well live with so many devils: six times out of seven they know not
               themselves what they want. 
               There the conversation ended; but
               Masetto began to cast about how he should proceed to get permission
               to live with them. He knew that he was quite competent for the
               services of which Nuto spoke, and had therefore no fear of failing on
               that score; but he doubted he should not be received, because he was
               too young and well-favoured. So, after much pondering, he fell into
               the following train of thought: The place is a long way off, and no
               one there knows me; if I make believe that I am dumb, doubtless
               I shall be admitted. Whereupon he made his mind up, laid a
               hatchet across his shoulder, and saying not a word to any of his
               destination, set forth, intending to present himself at the convent
               in the character of a destitute man. Arrived there, he had no
               sooner entered than he chanced to encounter the steward in the
               courtyard, and making signs to him as dumb folk do, he let him
               know that of his charity he craved something to eat, and that, if
               need were, he would split firewood. The steward promptly gave
               him to eat, and then set before him some logs which Nuto had not
               been able to split, all which Masetto, who was very strong, split
               in a very short time. The steward, having occasion to go to the
               wood, took him with him, and there set him at work on the lopping;
               which done he placed the ass in front of him, and by signs made him
               understand that he was to take the loppings back to the convent.
               This he did so well that the steward kept him for some days to do
               one or two odd jobs. Whereby it so befell that one day the abbess
               saw him, and asked the steward who he was. 
               Madam, replied
               the steward, 'tis a poor deaf mute that came here a day or two
               ago craving alms, so I have treated him kindly, and have let him
               make himself useful in many ways. If he knew how to do the work
               of the kitchen-garden and would stay with us, I doubt not we should
               be well served; for we have need of him, and he is strong, and would
               be able for whatever he might turn his hand to; besides which you
               would have no cause to be apprehensive lest he should be cracking
               his jokes with your young women. 
               As I trust in God, said the
               abbess, thou sayst sooth; find out if he can do the garden work,
               and if he can, do all thou canst to keep him with us; give him a
               pair of shoes, an old hood, and speak him well, make much of him,
               and let him be well fed. 
               All which the steward promised to do.
            </p>
            <p>Masetto, meanwhile, was close at hand, making as if he were
               sweeping the courtyard, and heard all that passed between the abbess
               and the steward, whereat he gleefully communed with himself on
               this wise: Put me once within there, and you will see that I will
               do the work of the kitchen-garden as it never was done before. 
               So
               the steward set him to work in the kitchen-garden, and finding that
               he knew his business excellently well, made signs to him to know
               whether he would stay, and he made answer by signs that he was
               ready to do whatever the steward wished. The steward then signified
               that he was engaged, told him to take charge of the kitchen-garden,
               and shewed him what he had to do there. Then, having other
               matters to attend to, he went away, and left him there. Now, as
               Masetto worked there day by day, the nuns began to tease him, and
               make him their butt (as it commonly happens that folk serve the
               dumb) and used bad language to him, the worst they could think of,
               supposing that he could not understand them: all which passed
               scarce heeded by the abbess, who perhaps deemed him as destitute
               of virility as of speech. Now it so befell that after a hard day's
               work he was taking a little rest, when two young nuns, who were
               walking in the garden, approached the spot where he lay, and stopped
               to look at him, while he pretended to be asleep. And so the bolder
               of the two said to the other: If I thought thou wouldst keep the
               secret, I would tell thee what I have sometimes meditated, and which
               thou perhaps mightest also find agreeable. 
               The other replied:
               Speak thy mind freely and be sure that I will never tell a soul.
               Whereupon the bold one began: I know not if thou hast ever
               considered how close we are kept here, and that within these precincts
               dare never enter any man, unless it be the old steward or
               this mute: and I have often heard from ladies that have come hither,
               that all the other sweets that the world has to offer signify not a jot
               in comparison of the pleasure that a woman has in connexion with
               a man. Whereof I have more than once been minded to make
               experiment with this mute, no other man being available. Nor,
               indeed, could one find any man in the whole world so meet therefor;
               seeing that he could not blab if he would; thou seest that he is but
               a dull clownish lad, whose size has increased out of all proportion
               to his sense; wherefore I would fain hear what thou hast to say to
               it. 
               Alas! said the other, what is 't thou sayst? Knowest
               thou not that we have vowed our virginity to God? 
               Oh,
               rejoined the first, think but how many vows are made to Him
               all day long, and never a one performed: and so, for our vow, let
               Him find another or others to perform it. 
               But, said her companion,
               suppose that we conceived, how then? 
               Nay but,
               protested the first, thou goest about to imagine evil before it befalls
               thee: time enough to think of that when it comes to pass; there
               will be a thousand ways to prevent its ever being known, so only
               we do not publish it ourselves. 
               Thus reassured, the other was now
               the more eager of the two to test the quality of the male human
               animal. Well then, she said, how shall we go about it? 
               and
               was answered: Thou seest 'tis past none; I make no doubt but
               all the sisters are asleep, except ourselves; search we through the
               kitchen-garden, to see if there be any there, and if there be none,
               we have but to take him by the hand and lead him hither to the
               hut where he takes shelter from the rain; and then one shall
               mount guard while the other has him with her inside. He is such
               a simpleton that he will do just whatever we bid him. 
               No word
               of this conversation escaped Masetto, who, being disposed to obey,
               hoped for nothing so much as that one of them should take him
               by the hand. They, meanwhile, looked carefully all about them,
               and satisfied themselves that they were secure from observation:
               then she that had broached the subject came close up to Masetto,
               and shook him; whereupon he started to his feet. So she took
               him by the hand with a blandishing air, to which he replied with
               some clownish grins. And then she led him into the hut, where
               he needed no pressing to do what she desired of him. 
               Which done,
               she changed places with the other, as loyal comradeship required;
               and Masetto, still keeping up the pretence of simplicity, did their
               pleasure. Wherefore before they left, each must needs make another
               assay of the mute's powers of riding; and afterwards, talking the
               matter over many times, they agreed that it was in truth not less
               but even more delightful than they had been given to understand;
               and so, as they found convenient opportunity, they continued to go
               and disport themselves with the mute.
            </p>
            <p>Now it so chanced that one of their gossips, looking out of the
               window of her cell, saw what they did, and imparted it to two
               others. The three held counsel together whether they should not
               denounce the offenders to the abbess, but soon changed their mind,
               and came to an understanding with them, whereby they became
               partners in Masetto. And in course of time by divers chances the
               remaining three nuns also entered the partnership. 
               Last of all the
               abbess, still witting nought of these doings, happened one very hot
               day, as she walked by herself through the garden, to find Masetto,
               who now rode so much by night that he could stand very little
               fatigue by day, stretched at full length asleep under the shade of
               an almond-tree, his person quite exposed in front by reason that the
               wind had disarranged his clothes. Which the lady observing, and
               knowing that she was alone, fell a prey to the same appetite to
               which her nuns had yielded: she aroused Masetto, and took him
               with her to her chamber, where, for some days, though the nuns
               loudly complained that the gardener no longer came to work in the
               kitchen-garden, she kept him, tasting and re-tasting the sweetness
               of that indulgence which she was wont to be the first to censure
               in others. And when at last she had sent him back from her
               chamber to his room, she must needs send for him again and again,
               and made such exorbitant demands upon him, that Masetto, not being
               able to satisfy so many women, bethought him that his part of mute,
               should he persist in it, might entail disastrous consequences. So one
               night, when he was with the abbess, he cut the tongue-string, and
               thus broke silence: Madam, I have understood that a cock may
               very well serve ten hens, but that ten men are sorely tasked to satisfy
               a single woman; and here am I expected to serve nine, a burden
               quite beyond my power to bear; nay, by what I have already undergone
               I am now so reduced that my strength is quite spent; wherefore
               either bid me Godspeed, or find some means to make matters
               tolerable. Wonder-struck to hear the supposed mute thus speak, the
               lady exclaimed: What means this? I took thee to be dumb.
               And in sooth, Madam, so was I, said Masetto, not indeed from
               my birth, but through an illness which took from me the power
               of speech, which only this very night have I recovered; and so I
               praise God with all my heart. 
               The lady believed him; and asked
               him what he meant by saying that he had nine to serve. Masetto
               told her how things stood; whereby she perceived that of all her
               nuns there was not any but was much wiser than she; and lest,
               if Masetto were sent away, he should give the convent a bad name,
               she discreetly determined to arrange matters with the nuns in such
               sort that he might remain there. So, the steward having died
               within the last few days, she assembled all the nuns; and their and
               her own past errors being fully avowed, they by common consent,
               and with Masetto's concurrence, resolved that the neighbours should
               be given to understand that by their prayers and the merits of their
               patron saint, Masetto, long mute, had recovered the power of speech;
               after which they made him steward, and so ordered matters among
               themselves that he was able to endure the burden of their service. 
               In
               the course of which, though he procreated not a few little monastics,
               yet 'twas all managed so discreetly that no breath of scandal stirred,
               until after the abbess's death, by which time Masetto was advanced
               in years and minded to return home with the wealth that he had
               gotten; which he was suffered to do as soon as he made his desire
               known. And so Masetto, who had left <span class="place">Lamporecchio</span> with a
               hatchet on his shoulder, returned thither in his old age rich and
               a father, having by the wisdom with which he employed his youth,
               spared himself the pains and expense of rearing children, and
               averring that such was the measure that Christ meted out to the
               man that set horns on his cap.

            <p>Agilulf, King of the Lombards, who like his predecessors made
               the city of <span class="place">Pavia</span> in <span class="place">Lombardy</span> the seat of his government, took
               to wife Theodelinde, the widow of Authari, likewise King of the
               Lombards, a lady very fair, wise and virtuous, but who was
               unfortunate in her lover. For while the Lombards prospered in
               peace under the wise and firm rule of King Agilulf, it so befell
               that one of the Queen's grooms, a man born to very low estate,
               but in native worth far above his mean office, and moreover not
               a whit less tall and goodly of person than the King, became
               inordinately enamoured of her. And as, for all his base condition,
               he had sense enough to recognize that his love was in the last
               degree presumptuous, he disclosed it to none, nay, he did not even
               venture to tell her the tale by the mute eloquence of his eyes.
               And albeit he lived without hope that he should ever be able to
               win her favour, yet he inwardly gloried that he had fixed his
               affections in so high a place; and being all aflame with passion,
               he shewed himself zealous beyond any of his comrades to do whatever
               he thought was likely to please the Queen. Whereby it came
               about, that, when the Queen had to take horse, she would mount
               the palfrey that he groomed rather than any other; and when she
               did so, he deemed himself most highly favoured, and never quitted
               her stirrup, esteeming himself happy if he might but touch her
               clothes. But as 'tis frequently observed that love waxes as hope
               wanes, so was it with this poor groom, insomuch that the burden
               of this great hidden passion, alleviated by no hope, was most grievous
               to bear, and from time to time, not being able to shake it off, he
               purposed to die. And meditating on the mode, he was minded
               that it should be of a kind to make it manifest that he died for the
               love which he had borne and bore to the Queen, and also to afford
               him an opportunity of trying his fortune whether his desire might
               in whole or in part be gratified. He had no thought of speaking
               to the Queen, nor yet of declaring his love to her by letter, for he
               knew that 'twould be vain either to speak or to write; but he
               resolved to try to devise some means whereby he might lie with
               the Queen; which end might in no other way be compassed than
               by contriving to get access to her in her bedroom; which could
               only be by passing himself off as the King, who, as he knew, did
               not always lie with her. Wherefore, that he might observe the
               carriage and dress of the King as he passed to her room, he contrived
               to conceal himself for several nights in a great hall of the
               King's palace which separated the King's room from that of the
               Queen: and on one of these nights he saw the King issue from
               his room, wrapped in a great mantle, with a lighted torch in one
               hand and a wand in the other, and cross the hall, and, saying
               nothing, tap the door of the Queen's room with the wand once
               or twice; whereupon the door was at once opened and the torch
               taken from his hand. Having observed the King thus go and
               return, and being bent on doing likewise, he found means to come
               by a mantle like that which he had seen the King wear, and also
               a torch and a wand: he then took a warm bath, and having
               thoroughly cleansed himself, that the smell of the foul straw might
               not offend the lady, or discover to her the deceit, he in this guise
               concealed himself as he was wont in the great hall. He waited
               only until all were asleep, and then, deeming the time come to
               accomplish his purpose, or by his presumption clear a way to the death
               which he coveted, he struck a light with the flint and steel which he
               had brought with him; and having kindled his torch and wrapped
               himself close in his mantle, he went to the door of the Queen's
               room, and tapped on it twice with his wand. The door was opened
               by a very drowsy chambermaid, who took the torch and put it out
               of sight; whereupon without a word he passed within the curtain,
               laid aside the mantle, and got into the bed where the Queen lay
               asleep. Then, taking her in his arms and straining her to him
               with ardour, making as if he were moody, because he knew that,
               when the King was in such a frame, he would never hear aught,
               in such wise, without word said either on his part or on hers,
               he had more than once carnal cognizance of the Queen. Loath
               indeed was he to leave her, but, fearing lest by too long tarrying
               his achieved delight might be converted into woe, he rose, resumed
               the mantle and the light, and leaving the room without a word,
               returned with all speed to his bed. He was hardly there when the
               King got up and entered the Queen's room; whereat she wondered
               not a little; but, reassured by the gladsome greeting which he gave
               her as he got into bed, she said: My lord, what a surprise is this
               to-night! 'Twas but now you left me after an unwonted measure
               of enjoyment, and do you now return so soon? consider what you
               do. 
               From these words the King at once inferred that the Queen
               had been deceived by some one that had counterfeited his person
               and carriage; but, at the same time, bethinking himself that, as
               neither the Queen nor any other had detected the cheat, 'twas
               best to leave her in ignorance, he wisely kept silence. Which
               many a fool would not have done, but would have said: Nay,
               'twas not I that was here. Who was it that was here? How
               came it to pass? Who came hither? 
               Whereby in the sequel
               he might have caused the lady needless chagrin, and given her
               occasion to desire another such experience as she had had; and
               so have brought disgrace upon himself by uttering that, from which,
               unuttered, no shame could have resulted. 
               Wherefore, betraying
               little, either by his mien or by his words, of the disquietude which
               he felt, the King replied: Madam, seem I such to you that you
               cannot suppose that I should have been with you once, and returned
               to you immediately afterwards? 
               Nay, not so, my lord, returned
               the lady, but none the less I pray you to look to your health.
               Then said the King: And I am minded to take your advice;
               wherefore, without giving you further trouble I will leave you.
               So, angered and incensed beyond measure by the trick which, he
               saw, had been played upon him, he resumed his mantle and quitted
               the room with the intention of privily detecting the offender,
               deeming that he must belong to the palace, and that, whoever he
               might be, he could not have quitted it. So, taking with him a
               small lantern which shewed only a glimmer of light, he went into
               the dormitory which was over the palace-stables and was of great
               length, insomuch that well-nigh all the men-servants slept there
               in divers beds, and arguing that, by whomsoever that of which the
               Queen spoke was done, his heart and pulse could not after such
               a strain as yet have ceased to throb, he began cautiously with one
               of the head-grooms, and so went from bed to bed feeling at the
               heart of each man to see if it was thumping. All were asleep,
               save only he that had been with the Queen, who, seeing the King
               come, and guessing what he sought to discover, began to be mightily
               afraid, insomuch that to the agitation which his late exertion had
               communicated to his heart, terror now added one yet more violent;
               nor did he doubt that, should the King perceive it, he would kill
               him. Divers alternatives of action thronged his mind; but at last,
               observing that the King was unarmed, he resolved to make as if
               he were asleep, and wait to see what the King would do. So,
               having tried many and found none that he deemed the culprit, the
               King came at last to the culprit himself, and marking the thumping
               of his heart, said to himself: This is he. But being minded to afford
               no clue to his ulterior purpose, he did no more than with a pair of
               scissors which he had brought with him shear away on one side
               of the man's head a portion of his locks, which, as was then the
               fashion, he wore very long, that by this token he might recognize
               him on the morrow; and having so done, he departed and returned
               to his room. The groom, who was fully sensible of what the King
               had done, and being a shrewd fellow understood very well to what
               end he was so marked, got up without a moment's delay; and,
               having found a pair of scissors--for, as it chanced, there were several
               pairs there belonging to the stables for use in grooming the horses--he
               went quietly through the dormitory and in like manner sheared
               the locks of each of the sleepers just above the ear; which done
               without disturbing any, he went back to bed.
            </p>
            <p>On the morrow, as soon as the King was risen, and before the
               gates of the palace were opened, he summoned all his men-servants to
               his presence, and, as they stood bareheaded before him, scanned them
               closely to see whether the one whom he had sheared was there; and
               observing with surprise that the more part of them were all sheared
               in the same manner, said to himself: Of a surety this fellow, whom
               I go about to detect, evinces, for all his base condition, a high degree
               of sense. Then, recognising that he could not compass his end
               without causing a bruit, and not being minded to brave so great a
               dishonour in order to be avenged upon so petty an offender, he was
               content by a single word of admonition to shew him that his offence
               had not escaped notice. Wherefore turning to them all, he said:
               He that did it, let him do it no more, and get you hence in God's
               peace. 
               Another would have put them to the strappado, the question,
               the torture, and thereby have brought to light that which one should
               rather be sedulous to cloak; and having so brought it to light, would,
               however complete the retribution which he exacted, have not
               lessened but vastly augmented his disgrace, and sullied the fair fame
               of his lady. Those who heard the King's parting admonition
               wondered, and made much question with one another, what the
               King might have meant to convey by it; but 'twas understood by
               none but him to whom it referred: who was discreet enough never to
               reveal the secret as long as the King lived, or again to stake his life
               on such a venture.

               <p>The story which I shall tell you is of a trick which was actually
                  played by a fair lady upon a booby religious, and which every layman
                  should find the more diverting that these religious, being, for the
                  most part, great blockheads and men of odd manners and habits, do
                  nevertheless credit themselves with more ability and knowledge in
                  all kinds than fall to the lot of the rest of the world; whereas, in
                  truth, they are far inferior, and so, not being able, like others, to
                  provide their own sustenance, are prompted by sheer baseness to fly
                  thither for refuge where they may find provender, like pigs. Which
                  story, sweet my ladies, I shall tell you, not merely that thereby I may
                  continue the sequence in obedience to the queen's behest, but also to
                  the end that I may let you see that even the religious, in whom we
                  in our boundless credulity repose exorbitant faith, may be, and sometimes
                  are, made--not to say by men--even by some of us women
                  the sport of their sly wit.

            </div>
            <p>In our city, where wiles do more abound than either love or
               faith, there dwelt, not many years ago, a gentlewoman richly
               endowed (none more so) by nature with physical charms, as also
               with gracious manners, high spirit and fine discernment. Her name
               I know, but will not disclose it, nor yet that of any other who
               figures in this story, because there yet live those who might take
               offence thereat, though after all it might well be passed off with a
               laugh. High-born and married to an artificer of woollen fabrics, she
               could not rid her mind of the disdain with which, by reason of his
               occupation, she regarded her husband; for no man, however wealthy,
               so he were of low condition, seemed to her worthy to have a gentlewoman
               to wife; and seeing that for all his wealth he was fit for
               nothing better than to devise a blend, set up a warp, or higgle about
               yarn with a spinster, she determined to dispense with his embraces,
               save so far as she might find it impossible to refuse them; and to find
               her satisfaction elsewhere with one that seemed to her more meet to
               afford it than her artificer of woollens. In this frame of mind she
               became enamoured of a man well worthy of her love and not yet
               past middle age, insomuch that, if she saw him not in the day, she
               must needs pass an unquiet night. The gallant, meanwhile, remained
               fancy-free, for he knew nought of the lady's case; and she, being
               apprehensive of possible perils to ensue, was far too circumspect to
               make it known to him either by writing or by word of mouth of
               any of her female friends. Then she learned that he had much to
               do with a religious, a simple, clownish fellow, but nevertheless, as
               being a man of most holy life, reputed by almost everybody a most
               worthy friar, and decided that she could not find a better intermediary
               between herself and her lover than this same friar. So,
               having matured her plan, she hied her at a convenient time to the
               convent where the friar abode, and sent for him, saying, that, if he
               so pleased, she would be confessed by him. The friar, who saw at
               a glance that she was a gentlewoman, gladly heard her confession;
               which done, she said: My father, I have yet a matter to confide
               to you, in which I must crave your aid and counsel. Who my
               kinsfolk and husband are, I wot you know, for I have myself told
               you. My husband loves me more dearly than his life, and being
               very wealthy, he can well and does forthwith afford me whatever I
               desire. Wherefore, as he loves me, even so I love him more dearly
               than myself; nor was there ever yet wicked woman that deserved
               the fire so richly as should I, were I guilty--I speak not of acts, but
               of so much as a single thought of crossing his will or tarnishing his
               honour. Now a man there is--his name, indeed, I know not, but
               he seems to me to be a gentleman, and, if I mistake not, he is much
               with you--a fine man and tall, his garb dun and very decent, who,
               the bent of my mind being, belike, quite unknown to him, would
               seem to have laid siege to me, insomuch that I cannot shew
               myself at door or casement, or quit the house, but forthwith he
               presents himself before me; indeed I find it passing strange that he
               is not here now; whereat I am sorely troubled, because, when men
               so act, unmerited reproach will often thereby be cast upon honest
               women. At times I have been minded to inform my brothers of
               the matter; but then I have bethought me that men sometimes
               frame messages in such a way as to evoke untoward answers, whence
               follow high words; and so they proceed to rash acts: wherefore, to
               obviate trouble and scandal, I have kept silence, and by preference
               have made you my confidant, both because you are the gentleman's
               friend, and because it befits your office to censure such behaviour
               not only in friends but in strangers. And so I beseech you for the
               love of our only Lord God to make him sensible of his fault, and
               pray him to offend no more in such sort. Other ladies there are in
               plenty, who may, perchance, be disposed to welcome such advances,
               and be flattered to attract his fond and assiduous regard, which to
               me, who am in no wise inclined to encourage it, is but a most
               grievous molestation.
            </p>
            <p>Having thus spoken, the lady bowed her head as if she were ready
               to weep. The holy friar was at no loss to apprehend who it was of
               whom she spoke; he commended her virtuous frame, firmly believing
               that what she said was true, and promised to take such action that
               she should not again suffer the like annoyance; nor, knowing that
               she was very wealthy, did he omit to extol works of charity and
               almsgiving, at the same time opening to her his own needs. 
               I
               make my suit to you, said she, for the love of God; and if your
               friend should deny what I have told you, tell him roundly that 'twas
               from me you had it, and that I made complaint to you thereof.
               So, her confession ended and penance imposed, bethinking her of the
               hints which the friar had dropped touching almsgiving, she slipped
               into his hand as many coins as it would hold, praying him to say
               masses for the souls of her dead. She then rose and went home.
            </p>
            <p>Not long afterwards the gallant paid one of his wonted visits to
               the holy friar. They conversed for a while of divers topics, and
               then the friar took him aside, and very courteously reproved him for
               so haunting and pursuing the lady with his gaze, as from what
               she had given him to understand, he supposed was his wont. The
               gallant, who had never regarded her with any attention, and very
               rarely passed her house, was amazed, and was about to clear himself,
               when the friar closed his mouth, saying: Now away with this
               pretence of amazement, and waste not words in denial, for 'twill not
               avail thee. I have it not from the neighbours; she herself, bitterly
               complaining of thy conduct, told it me. I say not how ill this
               levity beseems thee; but of her I tell thee so much as this, that, if
               I ever knew woman averse to such idle philandering, she is so;
               and therefore for thy honour's sake, and that she be no more vexed,
               I pray thee refrain therefrom, and let her be in peace. 
               The gallant,
               having rather more insight than the holy friar, was not slow to
               penetrate the lady's finesse; he therefore made as if he were rather
               shame-stricken, promised to go no further with the matter, and hied
               him straight from the friar to the lady's house, where she was always
               posted at a little casement to see if he were passing by. As she saw
               him come, she shewed him so gay and gracious a mien that he could
               no longer harbour any doubt that he had put the true construction
               upon what he had heard from the friar; and thenceforth, to his own
               satisfaction and the immense delight and solace of the lady, he
               omitted not daily to pass that way, being careful to make it appear
               as if he came upon other business. 'Twas thus not long before the
               lady understood that she met with no less favour in his eyes than he
               in hers; and being desirous to add fuel to his flame, and to assure him
               of the love she bore him, as soon as time and occasion served, she
               returned to the holy friar, and having sat herself down at his feet in
               the church, fell a weeping. The friar asked her in a soothing tone
               what her new trouble might be. Whereto the lady answered:
               My father, 'tis still that accursed friend of thine, of whom I made
               complaint to you some days ago, and who would now seem to have
               been born for my most grievous torment, and to cause me to do that
               by reason whereof I shall never be glad again, nor venture to place
               myself at your feet. 
               How? said the friar; has he not forborne
               to annoy thee? 
               Not he, indeed, said the lady; on the
               contrary, 'tis my belief that, since I complained to you of him, he
               has, as if in despite, being offended, belike, that I did so, passed my
               house seven times for once that he did so before. 
               Nay, would to
               God he were content to pass and fix me with his eyes; but he is
               waxed so bold and unabashed that only yesterday he sent a woman
               to me at home with his compliments and cajoleries, and, as if I had
               not purses and girdles enough, he sent me a purse and a girdle;
               whereat I was, as I still am, so wroth, that, had not conscience first,
               and then regard for you, weighed with me, I had flown into a frenzy
               of rage. However, I restrained myself, and resolved neither to do
               nor to say aught without first letting you know it. Nor only so;
               but, lest the woman who brought the purse and girdle, and to whom
               I at first returned them, shortly bidding her begone and take them
               back to the sender, should keep them and tell him that I had accepted
               them, as I believe they sometimes do, I recalled her and had them
               back, albeit 'twas in no friendly spirit that I received them from her
               hand; and I have brought them to you, that you may return them
               to him and tell him that I stand in no need of such gifts from him,
               because, thanks be to God and my husband, I have purses and girdles
               enough to smother him in. And if after this he leave me not alone,
               I pray you as my father to hold me excused if, come what may, I
               tell it to my husband and brothers; for much liefer had I that he
               suffer indignity, if so it must be, than that my fair fame should be
               sullied on his account: that holds good, friar. 
               Weeping bitterly
               as she thus ended, she drew from under her robe a purse of very fine
               and ornate workmanship and a dainty and costly little girdle, and
               threw them into the lap of the friar, who, fully believing what she
               said, manifested the utmost indignation as he took them, and said:
               Daughter, that by these advances thou shouldst be moved to anger, I
               deem neither strange nor censurable; but I am instant with thee to
               follow my advice in the matter. I chid him some days ago, and ill
               has he kept the promise that he made me; for which cause and this
               last feat of his I will surely make his ears so tingle that he will give
               thee no more trouble; wherefore, for God's sake, let not thyself be
               so overcome by wrath as to tell it to any of thy kinsfolk; which
               might bring upon him a retribution greater than he deserves. Nor
               fear lest thereby thy fair fame should suffer; for I shall ever be thy
               most sure witness before God and men that thou art innocent.
               The lady made a shew of being somewhat comforted: then, after a
               pause--for well she knew the greed of him and his likes--she said:
               Of late, Sir, by night, the spirits of divers of my kinsfolk have
               appeared to me in my sleep, and methinks they are in most grievous
               torment; alms, alms, they crave, nought else, especially my mother,
               who seems to be in so woful and abject a plight that 'tis pitiful
               to see. Methinks 'tis a most grievous torment to her to see the
               tribulation which this enemy of God has brought upon me. I would
               therefore have you say for their souls the forty masses of St. Gregory
               and some of your prayers, that God may deliver them from this
               purging fire. So saying she slipped a florin into the hand of the
               holy friar, who took it gleefully, and having with edifying words and
               many examples fortified her in her devotion, gave her his benediction,
               and suffered her to depart.
            </p>
            <p>The lady gone, the friar, who had still no idea of the trick that
               had been played upon him, sent for his friend; who was no sooner
               come than he gathered from the friar's troubled air that he had news
               of the lady, and waited to hear what he would say. The friar
               repeated what he had said before, and then broke out into violent
               and heated objurgation on the score of the lady's latest imputation.
               The gallant, who did not as yet apprehend the friar's drift, gave but
               a very faint denial to the charge of sending the purse and girdle, in
               order that he might not discredit the lady with the friar, if, perchance,
               she had given him the purse and girdle. Whereupon the friar exclaimed
               with great heat: How canst thou deny it, thou wicked
               man? Why, here they are; she brought them to me in tears with
               her own hand. Look at them, and say if thou knowest them not.
                The gallant now feigned to be much ashamed, and said: Why,
               yes, indeed, I do know them; I confess that I did wrong; and I
               swear to you that, now I know her character, you shall never hear
               word more of this matter. 
               Many words followed; and then the
               blockheadly friar gave the purse and girdle to his friend, after which
               he read him a long lecture, besought him to meddle no more with
               such matters, and on his promising obedience dismissed him.
            </p>
            <p>Elated beyond measure by the assurance which he now had of
               the lady's love, and the beautiful present, the gallant, on leaving the
               friar, hied him straight to a spot whence he stealthily gave the lady
               to see that he had both her gifts: whereat the lady was well content,
               the more so as her intrigue seemed ever to prosper more and more.
               She waited now only for her husband's departure from home to
               crown her enterprise with success. Nor was it long before occasion
               required that her husband should go to <span class="place">Genoa</span>. The very morning
               that he took horse and rode away she hied her to the holy friar, and
               after many a lamentation she said to him betwixt her sobs: My
               father, now at last I tell you out and out that I can bear my suffering
               no longer. I promised you some days ago to do nought in this
               matter without first letting you know it; I am now come to crave
               release from that promise; and that you may believe that my
               lamentations and complaints are not groundless, I will tell you how
               this friend of yours, who should rather be called a devil let loose
               from hell, treated me only this very morning, a little before matins.
               As ill-luck would have it, he learned, I know not how, that yesterday
               morning my husband went to <span class="place">Genoa</span>, and so this morning at the
               said hour he came into my garden, and got up by a tree to the
               window of my bedroom, which looks out over the garden, and had
               already opened the casement, and was about to enter the room, when
               I suddenly awoke, and got up and uttered a cry, and should have
               continued to cry out, had not he, who was still outside, implored my
               mercy for God's sake and yours, telling me who he was. So, for
               love of you I was silent, and naked as I was born, ran and shut the
               window in his face, and he--bad luck to him--made off, I suppose,
               for I saw him no more. Consider now if such behaviour be seemly
               and tolerable: I for my part am minded to put up with no more of
               it; indeed I have endured too much already for love of you.
            </p>
            <p>Wroth beyond measure was the friar, as he heard her thus speak,
               nor knew he what to say, except that he several times asked her if
               she were quite certain that it was no other than he. 
               Holy name
               of God! replied the lady, as if I did not yet know him from
               another! He it was, I tell you; and do you give no credence to his
               denial. 
               Daughter, said then the friar, there is here nought
               else to say but that this is a monstrous presumption and a most
               heinous offence; and thou didst well to send him away as thou didst.
               But seeing that God has preserved thee from shame, I would implore
               thee that, as thou hast twice followed my advice, thou do so likewise
               on this occasion, and making no complaint to any of thy kinsfolk,
               leave it to me to try if I can control this devil that has slipt his chain,
               whom I supposed to be a saint; and if I succeed in weaning him from
               this insensate folly, well and good; and if I fail, thenceforth I give
               thee leave, with my blessing, to do whatsoever may commend itself
               to thy own judgment. 
               Lo now, answered the lady, once
               again I will not vex or disobey you; but be sure that you so order
               matters that he refrain from further annoyance, as I give you my
               word that never will I have recourse to you again touching this
               matter. Then, without another word, and with a troubled air, she
               took leave of him. Scarcely was she out of the church when the
               gallant came up. The friar called him, took him aside, and gave him
               the affront in such sort as 'twas never before given to any man,
               reviling him as a disloyal and perjured traitor. The gallant, who by
               his two previous lessons had been taught how to value the friar's
               censures, listened attentively, and sought to draw him out by ambiguous
               answers. Wherefore this wrath, Sir? he began. Have I
               crucified Christ? 
               Ay, mark the fellow's effrontery! retorted
               the friar: list to what he says! He talks, forsooth, as if 'twere
               a year or so since, and his villanies and lewdnesses were clean gone from
               his memory for lapse of time. Between matins and now hast thou
               forgotten this morning's outrage? Where wast thou this morning
               shortly before daybreak? 
               Where was I? rejoined the gallant;
               that know not I. 'Tis indeed betimes that the news has reached
               you. 
               True indeed it is, said the friar, that the news has
               reached
               me: I suppose that, because the husband was not there, thou never
               doubtedst that thou wouldst forthwith be received by the lady with
               open arms. Ah! the gay gallant! the honourable gentleman! he
               is now turned prowler by night, and breaks into gardens, and climbs
               trees! Dost thou think by sheer importunity to vanquish the virtue
               of this lady, that thou escaladest her windows at night by the trees?
               She dislikes thee of all things in the world, and yet thou must still
               persist. Well indeed hast thou laid my admonitions to heart, to say
               nothing of the many proofs which she has given thee of her disdain!
               But I have yet a word for thee: hitherto, not that she bears thee
               any love, but that she has yielded to my urgent prayers, she has kept
               silence as to thy misdeeds: she will do so no more: I have given her
               leave to act as she may think fit, if thou givest her any further
               annoyance. And what wilt thou do if she informs her brothers?
               The gallant, now fully apprised of what it imported him to know,
               was profuse in promises, whereby as best he might he reassured the
               friar, and so left him. The very next night, as soon as the matin
               hour was come, he entered the garden, climbed up the tree, found the
               window open, entered the chamber, and in a trice was in the embrace
               of his fair lady. Anxiously had she expected him, and blithely did she
               now greet him, saying: All thanks to master friar that he so well
               taught thee the way hither. Then, with many a jest and laugh at
               the simplicity of the asinine friar, and many a flout at distaff-fuls and
               combs and cards, they solaced themselves with one another to their
               no small delight. Nor did they omit so to arrange matters that
               they were well able to dispense with master friar, and yet pass many
               another night together with no less satisfaction: to which goal I
               pray that I, and all other Christian souls that are so minded, may be
               speedily guided of God in His holy mercy.

            <p>Hard by <span class="place">San Pancrazio</span> there used to live, as I have heard tell,
               a worthy man and wealthy, Puccio di Rinieri by name, who in later
               life, under an overpowering sense of religion, became a tertiary of
               the order of St. Francis, and was thus known as Fra Puccio. In
               which spiritual life he was the better able to persevere that his
               household consisted but of a wife and a maid, and having no need to
               occupy himself with any craft, he spent no small part of his time at
               church; where, being a simple soul and slow of wit, he said his
               paternosters, heard sermons, assisted at the mass, never missed lauds
               (i. e. when chanted by the seculars), fasted and mortified his flesh;
               nay--so
               'twas whispered--he was of the Flagellants. His wife, Monna
               <span class="person">Isabetta</span> by name, a woman of from twenty-eight to thirty summers,
               still young for her age, lusty, comely and plump as a casolanPerhaps
               from Casoli, near <span class="place">Naples</span>. apple,
               had not unfrequently, by reason of her husband's devoutness, if not
               also of his age, more than she cared for, of abstinence; and when she
               was sleepy, or, maybe, riggish, he would repeat to her the life of Christ,
               and the sermons of Fra Nastagio, or the lament of the Magdalen, or
               the like. Now, while such was the tenor of her life, there returned
               from <span class="place">Paris</span> a young monk, by name Dom Felice, of the convent of
               <span class="place">San Pancrazio</span>, a well-favoured man and keen-witted, and profoundly
               learned, with whom Fra Puccio became very intimate; and as there
               was no question which he could put to him but Dom Felice could
               answer it, and moreover he made great shew of holiness, for well he
               knew Fra Puccio's bent, Fra Puccio took to bringing him home and
               entertaining him at breakfast and supper, as occasion served; and for
               love of her husband the lady also grew familiar with Dom Felice,
               and was zealous to do him honour. So the monk, being a constant
               visitor at Fra Puccio's house, and seeing the lady so lusty and plump,
               surmised that of which she must have most lack, and made up his
               mind to afford, if he could, at once relief to Fra Puccio and contentment
               to the lady. So cautiously, now and again, he cast an admiring
               glance in her direction with such effect that he kindled in her the
               same desire with which he burned, and marking his success, took the
               first opportunity to declare his passion to her. He found her fully
               disposed to gratify it; but how this might be, he was at a loss to
               discover, for she would not trust herself with him in any place whatever
               except her own house, and there it could not be, because Fra
               Puccio never travelled; whereby the monk was greatly dejected.
               Long he pondered the matter, and at length thought of an expedient,
               whereby he might be with the lady in her own house without
               incurring suspicion, notwithstanding that Fra Puccio was there.
               So, being with Fra Puccio one day, he said to him: Reasons
               many have I to know, Fra Puccio, that all thy desire is to become a
               saint; but it seems to me that thou farest by a circuitous route,
               whereas there is one very direct, which the Pope and the greater
               prelates that are about him know and use, but will have it remain a
               secret, because otherwise the clergy, who for the most part live by
               alms, and could not then expect alms or aught else from the laity,
               would be speedily ruined. However, as thou art my friend, and hast
               shewn me much honour, I would teach thee that way, if I were assured
               that thou wouldst follow it without letting another soul in the world
               hear of it. 
               Fra Puccio was now all agog to hear more of the matter,
               and began most earnestly entreating Dom Felice to teach him the
               way, swearing that without Dom Felice's leave none should ever
               hear of it from him, and averring that, if he found it practicable, he
               would certainly follow it. I am satisfied with thy promises, said
               the monk, and I will shew thee the way. Know then that the
               holy doctors hold that whoso would achieve blessedness must do the
               penance of which I shall tell thee; but see thou take me judiciously.
               I do not say that after the penance thou wilt not be a sinner, as thou
               art; but the effect will be that the sins which thou hast committed
               up to the very hour of the penance will all be purged away and
               thereby remitted to thee, and the sins which thou shalt commit
               thereafter will not be written against thee to thy damnation, but will
               be quit by holy water, like venial sins. First of all then the penitent
               must with great exactitude confess his sins when he comes to begin
               the penance. Then follows a period of fasting and very strict
               abstinence which must last for forty days, during which time he is to
               touch no woman whomsoever, not even his wife. Moreover, thou
               must have in thy house some place whence thou mayst see the sky
               by night, whither thou must resort at compline; and there thou must
               have a beam, very broad, and placed in such a way, that, standing,
               thou canst rest thy nether part upon it, and so, not raising thy feet
               from the ground, thou must extend thy arms, so as to make a sort of
               crucifix, and if thou wouldst have pegs to rest them on thou mayst;
               and on this manner, thy gaze fixed on the sky, and never moving a
               jot, thou must stand until matins. And wert thou lettered, it were
               proper for thee to say meanwhile certain prayers that I would give
               thee; but as thou art not so, thou must say three hundred paternosters
               and as many avemarias in honour of the Trinity; and thus
               contemplating the sky, be ever mindful that God was the creator of
               the heaven and the earth, and being set even as Christ was upon the
               cross, meditate on His passion. Then, when the matin-bell sounds,
               thou mayst, if thou please, go to bed--but see that thou undress not--and
               sleep; but in the morning thou must go to church, and hear
               at least three masses, and say fifty paternosters and as many avemarias;
               after which thou mayst with a pure heart do aught that thou hast
               to do, and breakfast; but at vespers thou must be again at church,
               and say there certain prayers, which I shall give thee in writing and
               which are indispensable, and after compline thou must repeat thy
               former exercise. Do this, and I, who have done it before thee, have
               good hope that even before thou shalt have reached the end of the
               penance, thou wilt, if thou shalt do it in a devout spirit, have already
               a marvellous foretaste of the eternal blessedness. 
               This, said Fra
               Puccio, is neither a very severe nor a very long penance, and can
               be very easily managed: wherefore in God's name I will begin on
               Sunday. 
               And so he took his leave of Dom Felice, and went home,
               and, by Dom Felice's permission, informed his wife of every particular
               of his intended penance.
            </p>
            <p>The lady understood very well what the monk meant by enjoining
               him not to stir from his post until matins; and deeming it an
               excellent device, she said that she was well content that he should do
               this or aught else that he thought good for his soul; and to the end
               that his penance might be blest of God, she would herself fast with
               him, though she would go no further. 
               So they did as they had
               agreed: when Sunday came Fra Puccio began his penance, and master
               monk, by understanding with the lady, came most evenings, at the
               hour when he was secure from discovery, to sup with her, always
               bringing
               with him abundance both of meat and of drink, and after slept
               with her till the matin hour, when he got up and left her, and Fra
               Puccio went to bed. The place which Fra Puccio had chosen for
               his penance was close to the room in which the lady slept, and only
               separated from it by the thinnest of partitions; so that, the monk and
               the lady disporting themselves with one another without stint or
               restraint, Fra Puccio thought he felt the floor of the house shake a
               little, and pausing at his hundredth paternoster, but without leaving
               his post, called out to the lady to know what she was about. The
               lady, who dearly loved a jest, and was just then riding the horse of
               St. Benedict or St. John Gualbert, answered: I'faith, husband, I am
               as restless as may be. 
               Restless, said Fra Puccio, how so? What
               means this restlessness? 
               Whereto with a hearty laugh, for which
               she doubtless had good occasion, the bonny lady replied: What
               means it? How should you ask such a question? Why, I have
               heard you say a thousand times: 'Who fasting goes to bed, uneasy
               lies his head.' 
               Fra Puccio, supposing that her wakefulness and
               restlessness abed was due to want of food, said in good faith: Wife,
               I told thee I would have thee not fast; but as thou hast chosen to
               fast, think not of it, but think how thou mayst compose thyself to
               sleep; thou tossest about the bed in such sort that the shaking is felt
               here. 
               That need cause thee no alarm, rejoined the lady. I
               know what I am about; I will manage as well as I can, and do thou
               likewise. 
               So Fra Puccio said no more to her, but resumed his
               paternosters; and thenceforth every night, while Fra Puccio's penance
               lasted, the lady and master monk, having had a bed made up for them
               in another part of the house, did there wanton it most gamesomely,
               the monk departing and the lady going back to her bed at one and
               the same time, being shortly before Fra Puccio's return from his
               nightly vigil. The friar thus persisting in his penance while the lady
               took her fill of pleasure with the monk, she would from time to time
               say jestingly to him: Thou layest a penance upon Fra Puccio
               whereby we are rewarded with Paradise. 
               So well indeed did she
               relish the dainties with which the monk regaled her, the more so by
               contrast with the abstemious life to which her husband had long
               accustomed her, that, when Fra Puccio's penance was done, she found
               means to enjoy them elsewhere, and ordered her indulgence with
               such discretion as to ensure its long continuance. Whereby (that my
               story may end as it began) it came to pass that Fra Puccio, hoping by
               his penance to win a place for himself in Paradise, did in fact translate
               thither the monk who had shewn him the way, and the wife who
               lived with him in great dearth of that of which the monk in his
               charity gave her superabundant largess.

                  	began:

            <div class="frame">
               <p>Many there are that, being very knowing, think that others
                  	are quite the reverse; and so, many a time, thinking to beguile
                  	others, are themselves beguiled; wherefore I deem it the height of
                  	folly for any one wantonly to challenge another to a contest of

                  	am minded, without deviating from the prescribed order, to acquaint
                  	you with that which thereby befell a certain knight of <span class="place">Pistoia</span>.
               </p>
            </div>
            <p>Know then that at <span class="place">Pistoia</span> there lived a knight, Messer <span class="place">France</span>sco,
               by name, of the Vergellesi family, a man of much wealth and good
               parts, being both wise and clever, but withal niggardly beyond
               measure. Which Messer <span class="place">France</span>sco, having to go to <span class="place">Milan</span> in the
               capacity of podest√†, had provided himself with all that was meet
               for the honourable support of such a dignity, save only a palfrey
               handsome enough for him; and not being able to come by any
               such, he felt himself at a loss. Now there was then in <span class="place">Pistoia</span>
               a young man, Ricciardo by name, of low origin but great wealth,
               who went always so trim and fine and foppish of person, that folk
               had bestowed upon him the name of Zima,From the Low Latin
               aczima, explained by Du Cange as tonture de
               draps, the process of dressing cloth so as to give it an even nap. Zima
               is thus equivalent to nitidus. Cf. Vocab. degli Accademici della
               Crusca,
               Azzimare. by which he was
               generally known. Zima had long and to no purpose burned and
               yearned for love of Messer <span class="place">France</span>sco's very fair and no less virtuous
               wife. His passion was matter of common notoriety; and so it befell
               that some one told Messer <span class="place">France</span>sco that he had but to ask Zima,
               who was the possessor of one of the handsomest palfreys in <span class="place">Tuscany</span>,
               which on that account he greatly prized, and he would not hesitate
               to give him the horse for the love which he bore his wife. So our
               niggardly knight sent for Zima, and offered to buy the horse of
               him, hoping thereby to get him from Zima as a gift. 
               Zima
               heard the knight gladly, and thus made answer: Sell you my
               horse, Sir, I would not, though you gave me all that you have in
               the world; but I shall be happy to give him to you, when you will,
               on this condition, that, before he pass into your hands, I may by your
               leave and in your presence say a few words to your wife so privately
               that I may be heard by her alone. 
               Thinking at once to gratify
               his cupidity and to outwit Zima, the knight answered that he was
               content that it should be even as Zima wished. Then, leaving him
               in the hall of the palace, he went to his lady's chamber, and told her
               the easy terms on which he might acquire the palfrey, bidding her
               give Zima his audience, but on no account to vouchsafe him a word
               of reply. This the lady found by no means to her mind, but, as
               she must needs obey her husband's commands, she promised compliance,
               and followed him into the hall to hear what Zima might
               have to say. Zima then renewed his contract with the knight in due
               form; whereupon, the lady being seated in a part of the hall where
               she was quite by herself, he sate down by her side, and thus began:
               Noble lady, I have too much respect for your understanding
               to doubt that you have long been well aware of the extremity of
               passion whereto I have been brought by your beauty, which certainly
               exceeds that of any other lady that I have ever seen, to say nothing
               of your exquisite manners and incomparable virtues, which might
               well serve to captivate every soaring spirit that is in the world;
               wherefore there need no words of mine to assure you that I love
               you with a love greater and more ardent than any that man yet
               bore to woman, and so without doubt I shall do, as long as my
               woful life shall hold this frame together; nay, longer yet, for, if
               love there be in the next world as in this, I shall love you evermore.
               And so you may make your mind secure that there is nothing that
               is yours, be it precious or be it common, which you may count as
               in such and so sure a sort your own as me, for all that I am and have.
               And that thereof you may not lack evidence of infallible cogency,
               I tell you, that I should deem myself more highly favoured, if I
               might at your command do somewhat to pleasure you, than if at
               my command the whole world were forthwith to yield me obedience.
               And as 'tis even in such sort that I am yours, 'tis not unworthily
               that I make bold to offer my petitions to Your Highness, as being
               to me the sole, exclusive source of all peace, of all bliss, of all health.
               Wherefore, as your most lowly vassal, I pray you, dear my bliss,
               my soul's one hope, wherein she nourishes herself in love's devouring
               flame, that in your great benignity you deign so far to mitigate the
               harshness which in the past you have shewn towards me, yours though
               I am, that, consoled by your compassion, I may say, that, as 'twas
               by your beauty that I was smitten with love, so 'tis to your pity
               that I owe my life, which, if in your haughtiness you lend not ear
               unto my prayers, will assuredly fail, so that I shall die, and, it may
               be, 'twill be said that you slew me. 'Twould not redound to your
               honour that I died for love of you; but let that pass; I cannot but
               think, however, that you would sometimes feel a touch of remorse,
               and would grieve that 'twas your doing, and that now and again,
               relenting, you would say to yourself: 'Ah! how wrong it was of
               me that I had not pity on my Zima;' by which too late repentance
               you would but enhance your grief. Wherefore, that this come not
               to pass, repent you while it is in your power to give me ease, and
               shew pity on me before I die, seeing that with you it rests to make
               me either the gladdest or the saddest man that lives. My trust is
               in your generosity, that 'twill not brook that a love so great and
               of such a sort as mine should receive death for guerdon, and that
               by a gladsome and gracious answer you will repair my shattered
               spirits, which are all a-tremble in your presence for very fear.
               When he had done, he heaved several very deep sighs, and a few
               tears started from his eyes, while he awaited the lady's answer.
            </p>
            <p>Long time he had wooed her with his eyes, had tilted in her
               honour, had greeted her rising with music; and against these and
               all like modes of attack she had been proof; but the heartfelt words
               of her most ardent lover were not without their effect, and she now
               began to understand what she had never till then understood, to wit,
               what love really means. So, albeit she obeyed her lord's behest, and
               kept silence, yet she could not but betray by a slight sigh that which,
               if she might have given Zima his answer, she would readily have
               avowed. After waiting a while, Zima found it strange that no
               answer was forthcoming; and he then began to perceive the trick
               which the knight had played him. However, he kept his eyes fixed
               on the lady, and observing that her eyes glowed now and again, as
               they met his, and noting the partially suppressed sighs which escaped
               her, he gathered a little hope, which gave him courage to try a novel
               plan of attack. So, while the lady listened, he began to make answer
               for her to himself on this wise: 
               Zima mine, true indeed it is that
               long since I discerned that thou didst love me with a love exceeding
               great and whole-hearted, whereof I have now yet ampler assurance
               by thine own words, and well content I am therewith, as indeed
               I ought to be. And however harsh and cruel I may have seemed
               to thee, I would by no means have thee believe, that I have been such
               at heart as I have seemed in aspect; rather, be assured that I have
               ever loved thee and held thee dear above all other men; the mien
               which I have worn was but prescribed by fear of another and
               solicitude for my fair fame. But a time will soon come when I
               shall be able to give thee plain proof of my love, and to accord
               the love which thou hast borne and dost bear me its due guerdon.
               Wherefore be comforted and of good hope; for, Messer <span class="place">France</span>sco
               is to go in a few days' time to <span class="place">Milan</span> as podest√†, as thou well
               knowest, seeing that for love of me thou hast given him thy fine
               palfrey; and I vow to thee upon my faith, upon the true love
               which I bear thee, that without fail, within a few days thereafter
               thou shalt be with me, and we will give our love complete and
               gladsome consummation. And that I may have no more occasion
               to speak to thee of this matter, be it understood between us that
               henceforth when thou shalt observe two towels disposed at the
               window of my room which overlooks the garden, thou shalt come
               to me after nightfall of that same day by the garden door (and look
               well to it that thou be not seen), and thou shalt find me waiting
               for thee, and we will have our fill of mutual cheer and solace all
               night long.
            </p>
            <p>Having thus answered for the lady, Zima resumed his own
               person and thus replied to the lady: Dearest madam, your boon
               response so overpowers my every faculty that scarce can I frame
               words to render you due thanks; and, were I able to utter all I feel,
               time, however long, would fail me fully to thank you as I would
               fain and as I ought: wherefore I must even leave it to your sage
               judgment to divine that which I yearn in vain to put in words.
               Let this one word suffice, that as you bid me, so I shall not fail
               to do; and then, having, perchance, firmer assurance of the great
               boon which you have granted me, I will do my best endeavour to
               thank you in terms the amplest that I may command. For the
               present there is no more to say; and so, dearest my lady, I commend
               you to God; and may He grant you your heart's content of
               joy and bliss. 
               To all which the lady returned never a word:
               wherefore Zima rose and turned to rejoin the knight, who, seeing
               him on his feet, came towards him, and said with a laugh: How
               sayst thou? Have I faithfully kept my promise to thee? 
               Not so,
               Sir, replied Zima; for by thy word I was to have spoken with thy
               wife, and by thy deed I have spoken to a statue of marble. 
               Which
               remark was much relished by the knight, who, well as he had thought
               of his wife, thought now even better of her, and said: So thy
               palfrey, that was, is now mine out and out. 
               'Tis even so, Sir,
               replied Zima; but had I thought to have gotten such fruit as I
               have from this favour of yours, I would not have craved it, but
               would have let you have the palfrey as a free gift: and would to
               God I had done so, for, as it is, you have bought the palfrey and
               I have not sold him. 
               This drew a laugh from the knight, who
               within a few days thereafter mounted the palfrey which he had
               gotten, and took the road for <span class="place">Milan</span>, there to enter on his podestate.
               The lady, now mistress of herself, bethought her of Zima's words,
               and the love which he bore her, and for which he had parted with
               his palfrey; and observing that he frequently passed her house, said
               to herself: 
               What am I about? Why throw I my youth away?
               My husband is gone to <span class="place">Milan</span>, and will not return for six months,
               and when can he ever restore them to me? When I am old!
               And besides, shall I ever find another such lover as Zima? I am
               quite by myself. There is none to fear. I know not why I take
               not my good time while I may: I shall not always have the like
               opportunity as at present: no one will ever know; and if it should
               get known, 'tis better to do and repent than to forbear and repent.
               Of which meditations the issue was that one day she set two towels
               in the window overlooking the garden, according to Zima's word;
               and Zima having marked them with much exultation, stole at
               nightfall alone to the door of the lady's garden, and finding it open,
               crossed to another door that led into the house, where he found the
               lady awaiting him. On sight of him she rose to meet him, and
               gave him the heartiest of welcomes. A hundred thousand times
               he embraced and kissed her, as he followed her upstairs: then
               without delay they hied them to bed, and knew love's furthest
               bourne. And so far was the first time from being in this case the
               last, that, while the knight was at <span class="place">Milan</span>, and indeed after his return,
               there were seasons not a few at which Zima resorted thither to the
               immense delight of both parties.

            <p>In the very ancient city of <span class="place">Naples</span>, which for loveliness has not
               its superior or perhaps its equal in <span class="place">Italy</span>, there once lived a young
               man, renowned alike for noble blood and the splendour of his vast
               wealth, his name Ricciardo Minutolo. He was mated with a very
               fair and loving wife; but nevertheless he became enamoured of a
               lady who in the general opinion vastly surpassed in beauty every other
               lady in <span class="place">Naples</span>. Catella--such was the lady's name--was married to
               a young man, likewise of gentle blood, Filippello Fighinolfi by name,
               whom she, most virtuous of ladies, loved and held dear above all else
               in the world. Being thus enamoured of Catella, Ricciardo Minutolo
               left none of those means untried whereby a lady's favour and love
               are wont to be gained, but for all that he made no way towards the
               attainment of his heart's desire: whereby he fell into a sort of despair,
               and witless and powerless to loose himself from his love, found life
               scarce tolerable, and yet knew not how to die. While in this frame
               he languished, it befell one day that some ladies that were of kin to
               him counselled him earnestly to be quit of such a love, whereby he
               could but fret himself to no purpose, seeing that Catella cared for
               nought in the world save Filippello, and lived in such a state of
               jealousy on his account that never a bird flew but she feared lest it
               should snatch him from her. So soon as Ricciardo heard of Catella's
               jealousy, he forthwith began to ponder how he might make it
               subserve his end. He feigned to have given up his love for Catella
               as hopeless, and to have transferred it to another lady, in whose
               honour he accordingly began to tilt and joust and do all that he
               had been wont to do in honour of Catella. Nor was it long before
               well-nigh all the Neapolitans, including Catella herself, began to
               think that he had forgotten Catella, and was to the last degree
               enamoured of the other lady. In this course he persisted, until the
               opinion was so firmly rooted in the minds of all that even Catella
               laid aside a certain reserve which she had used towards him while
               she deemed him her lover, and, coming and going, greeted him in
               friendly, neighbourly fashion, like the rest. Now it so befell that
               during the hot season, when, according to the custom of the
               Neapolitans, many companies of ladies and gentlemen went down to
               the sea-coast to recreate themselves and breakfast and sup, Ricciardo,
               knowing that Catella was gone thither with her company, went
               likewise with his, but, making as if he were not minded to stay
               there, he received several invitations from the ladies of Catella's
               company before he accepted any. When the ladies received him,
               they all with one accord, including Catella, began to rally him on
               his new love, and he furnished them with more matter for talk
               by feigning a most ardent passion. At length most of the ladies
               being gone off, one hither, another thither, as they do in such places,
               leaving Catella and a few others with Ricciardo, he tossed at Catella
               a light allusion to a certain love of her husband Filippello, which
               threw her at once into such a fit of jealousy, that she inly burned
               with a vehement desire to know what Ricciardo meant. For a
               while she kept her own counsel; then, brooking no more suspense,
               she adjured Ricciardo, by the love he bore the lady whom most he
               loved, to expound to her what he had said touching Filippello. He
               answered thus: You have adjured me by her to whom I dare
               not deny aught that you may ask of me; my riddle therefore I will
               presently read you, provided you promise me that neither to him nor
               to any one else will you impart aught of what I shall relate to you,
               until you shall have ocular evidence of its truth; which, so you desire
               it, I will teach you how you may obtain. 
               The lady accepted his
               terms, which rather confirmed her belief in his veracity, and swore
               that she would not tell a soul. They then drew a little apart, that
               they might not be overheard by the rest, and Ricciardo thus began:
               Madam, did I love you, as I once did, I should not dare to tell
               you aught that I thought might cause you pain; but, now that that
               love is past, I shall have the less hesitation in telling you the truth.
               Whether Filippello ever resented the love which I bore you, or
               deemed that it was returned by you, I know not: whether it were
               so or no, he certainly never shewed any such feeling to me; but
               so it is that now, having waited, perhaps, until, as he supposes, I am
               less likely to be on my guard, he shews a disposition to serve me
               as I doubt he suspects that I served him; that is to say, he would
               fain have his pleasure of my wife, whom for some time past he has,
               as I discover, plied with messages through most secret channels. She
               has told me all, and has answered him according to my instructions:
               but only this morning, just before I came hither, I found a woman
               in close parley with her in the house, whose true character and
               purpose I forthwith divined; so I called my wife, and asked what the
               woman wanted. Whereto she answered: ''Tis this persecution
               by Filippello which thou hast brought upon me by the encouraging
               answers that thou wouldst have me give him: he now tells me that
               he is most earnestly desirous to know my intentions, and that, should
               I be so minded, he would contrive that I should have secret access
               to a bagnio in this city, and he is most urgent and instant that I
               should consent. And hadst thou not, wherefore I know not, bidden
               me keep the affair afoot, I would have dismissed him in such a
               sort that my movements would have been exempt from his prying
               observation for ever. Upon this I saw that the affair was going
               too far; I determined to have no more of it, and to let you know
               it, that you may understand how he requites your whole-hearted
               faith, which brought me of late to the verge of death. And that
               you may not suppose that these are but empty words and idle tales,
               but may be able, should you so desire, to verify them by sight and
               touch, I caused my wife to tell the woman who still waited her
               answer, that she would be at the bagnio to-morrow about none,
               during the siesta: with which answer the woman went away well
               content. Now you do not, I suppose, imagine that I would send
               her thither; but if I were in your place, he should find me there
               instead of her whom he thinks to find there; and when I had been
               some little time with him, I would give him to understand with
               whom he had been, and he should have of me such honour as he
               deserved. Whereby, I doubt not, he would be put to such shame
               as would at one and the same time avenge both the wrong which
               he has done to you and that which he plots against me.
            </p>
            <p>Catella, as is the wont of the jealous, hearkened to Ricciardo's words
               without so much as giving a thought to the speaker or his wiles,
               inclined at once to credit his story, and began to twist certain antecedent
               matters into accord with it; then, suddenly kindling with
               wrath, she answered, that to the bagnio she would certainly go;
               'twould cause her no great inconvenience, and if he should come, she
               would so shame him that he should never again set eyes on woman
               but his ears would tingle. Satisfied by what he heard, that his
               stratagem was well conceived, and success sure, Ricciardo added much
               in corroboration of his story, and having thus confirmed her belief
               in it, besought her to keep it always close, whereto she pledged
               her faith.
            </p>
            <p>Next morning Ricciardo hied him to the good woman that kept
               the bagnio to which he had directed Catella, told her the enterprise
               which he had in hand, and prayed her to aid him therein so far as
               she might be able. The good woman, who was much beholden to
               him, assured him that she would gladly do so, and concerted with
               him all that was to be said and done. She had in the bagnio a room
               which was very dark, being without any window to admit the light.
               This room, by Ricciardo's direction, she set in order, and made up a
               bed there as well as she could, into which bed Ricciardo got, as soon
               as he had breakfasted, and there awaited Catella's coming.
            </p>
            <p>Now Catella, still giving more credence to Ricciardo's story than
               it merited, had gone home in the evening in a most resentful mood,
               and Filippello, returning home the same evening with a mind greatly
               preoccupied, was scarce as familiar with her as he was wont to be.
               Which she marking, grew yet more suspicious than before, and said
               to herself: Doubtless he is thinking of the lady of whom he expects
               to take his pleasure to-morrow, as most assuredly he shall not; and
               so, musing and meditating what she should say to him after their
               rencounter at the bagnio, she spent the best part of the night. But--to
               shorten my story--upon the stroke of none Catella, taking with
               her a single attendant, but otherwise adhering to her original intention,
               hied her to the bagnio which Ricciardo had indicated; and finding
               the good woman there, asked her whether Filippello had been there
               that day. Primed by Ricciardo, the good woman asked her, whether
               she were the lady that was to come to speak with him; to which she
               answered in the affirmative. 
               Go to him, then, said the good
               woman. And so Catella, in quest of that which she would gladly
               not have found, was shewn to the chamber where Ricciardo was,
               and having entered without uncovering her head, closed the door
               behind her. Overjoyed to see her, Ricciardo sprang out of bed, took
               her in his arms, and said caressingly: Welcome, my soul.
               Catella, dissembling, for she was minded at first to counterfeit another
               woman, returned his embrace, kissed him, and lavished endearments
               upon him; saying, the while, not a word, lest her speech should
               betray her. The darkness of the room, which was profound, was
               equally welcome to both; nor were they there long enough for their
               eyes to recover power. Ricciardo helped Catella on to the bed,
               where, with no word said on either side in a voice that might be
               recognized, they lay a long while, much more to the solace and
               satisfaction of the one than of the other party. Then, Catella,
               deeming it high time to vent her harboured resentment, burst forth
               in a blaze of wrath on this wise: Alas! how wretched is the lot
               of women, how misplaced of not a few the love they bear their
               husbands! Ah, woe is me! for eight years have I loved thee more
               dearly than my life; and now I find that thou, base miscreant that
               thou art, dost nought but burn and languish for love of another
               woman! Here thou hast been--with whom, thinkest thou? Even
               with her whom thou hast too long deluded with thy false blandishments,
               making pretence to love her while thou art enamoured of
               another. 'Tis I, Catella, not the wife of Ricciardo, false traitor
               that thou art; list if thou knowest my voice; 'tis I indeed! Ah!
               would we were but in the light!--it seems to me a thousand years
               till then--that I might shame thee as thou deservest, vile, pestilent
               dog that thou art! Alas! woe is me! such love as I have borne so
               many years--to whom? To this faithless dog, that, thinking to have a
               strange woman in his embrace, has in the brief while that I have
               been with him here lavished upon me more caresses and endearments
               than during all the forepast time that I have been his! A lively
               spark indeed art thou to-day, renegade dog, that shewest thyself
               so limp and enervate and impotent at home! But, God be praised,
               thou hast tilled thine own plot, and not another's, as thou didst believe.
               No wonder that last night thou heldest aloof from me; thou wast
               thinking of scattering thy seed elsewhere, and wast minded to shew
               thyself a lusty knight when thou shouldst join battle. But praise be
               to God and my sagacity, the water has nevertheless taken its proper
               course. Where is thy answer, culprit? Hast thou nought to say?
               Have my words struck thee dumb? God's faith! I know not why I
               forbear to pluck thine eyes out with my fingers! Thou thoughtest
               to perpetrate this treason with no small secrecy; but, by God, one is
               as knowing as another; thy plot has failed; I had better hounds on
               thy trail than thou didst think for. 
               Ricciardo, inly delighted by her
               words, made no answer, but embraced and kissed her more than
               ever, and overwhelmed her with his endearments. So she continued
               her reproaches, saying: Ay, thou thinkest to cajole me with thy
               feigned caresses, wearisome dog that thou art, and so to pacify and
               mollify me; but thou art mistaken. I shall never be mollified, until
               I have covered thee with infamy in the presence of all our kinsfolk
               and friends and neighbours. Am I not, miscreant, as fair as the wife
               of Ricciardo Minutolo? Am I not as good a lady as she? Why
               dost not answer, vile dog? Wherein has she the advantage of me?
               Away with thee! touch me not; thou hast done feats of arms more
               than enough for to-day. Well I know that, now that thou knowest
               who I am, thou wilt wreak thy will on me by force: but by God's
               grace I will yet disappoint thee. I know not why I forbear to send
               for Ricciardo, who loved me more than himself and yet was never
               able to boast that he had a single glance from me; nor know I why
               'twere wrong to do so. Thou thoughtest to have his wife here, and
               'tis no fault of thine that thou hadst her not: so, if I had him, thou
               couldst not justly blame me.
            </p>
            <p>Enough had now been said: the lady's mortification was extreme;
               and, as she ended, Ricciardo bethought him that, if he suffered her,
               thus deluded, to depart, much evil might ensue. He therefore
               resolved to make himself known, and disabuse her of her error. So,
               taking her in his arms, and clipping her so close that she could not
               get loose, he said: Sweet my soul, be not wroth: that which,
               while artlessly I loved, I might not have, Love has taught me to
               compass by guile: know that I am thy Ricciardo.
            </p>
            <p>At these words and the voice, which she recognized, Catella
               started, and would have sprung out of the bed; which being
               impossible, she essayed a cry; but Ricciardo laid a hand upon her
               mouth, and closed it, saying: Madam, that which is done can
               never be undone, though you should cry out for the rest of your
               days, and should you in such or any other wise publish this matter to
               any, two consequences will ensue. In the first place (and this is a
               point which touches you very nearly) your honour and fair fame will
               be blasted; for, however you may say that I lured you hither by
               guile, I shall deny it, and affirm, on the contrary, that I induced you
               to come hither by promises of money and gifts, and that 'tis but
               because you are vexed that what I gave you did not altogether come
               up to your expectations, that you make such a cry and clamour; and
               you know that folk are more prone to believe evil than good, and
               therefore I am no less likely to be believed than you. The further
               consequence will be mortal enmity between your husband and me, and
               the event were as like to be that I killed him as that he killed me:
               which if I did, you would never more know joy or peace. Wherefore,
               heart of my body, do not at one and the same time bring dishonour
               upon yourself and set your husband and me at strife and in jeopardy
               of our lives. You are not the first, nor will you be the last to be
               beguiled; nor have I beguiled you to rob you of aught, but for excess
               of love that I bear, and shall ever bear, you, being your most lowly
               vassal. And though it is now a great while that I, and what I have
               and can and am worth, are yours, yet I am minded that so it shall be
               henceforth more than ever before. Your discretion in other matters
               is not unknown to me, and I doubt not 'twill be equally manifest
               in this.
            </p>
            <p>Ricciardo's admonitions were received by Catella with many a
               bitter tear; but though she was very wroth and very sad at heart,
               yet Ricciardo's true words so far commanded the assent of her
               reason, that she acknowledged that 'twas possible they might be
               verified by the event. Wherefore she made answer: 
               Ricciardo,
               I know not how God will grant me patience to bear the villainy and
               knavery which thou hast practised upon me; and though in this
               place, to which simplicity and excess of jealousy guided my steps, I
               raise no cry, rest assured that I shall never be happy, until in one way
               or another I know myself avenged of that which thou hast done to
               me. Wherefore unhand me, let me go: thou hast had thy desire of
               me, and hast tormented me to thy heart's content: 'tis time to release
               me; let me go, I pray thee. 
               But Ricciardo, seeing that she was
               still much ruffled in spirit, was resolved not to let her go, until he
               had made his peace with her. So he addressed himself to soothe
               her; and by dint of most dulcet phrases and entreaties and adjurations
               he did at last prevail with her to give him her pardon; nay, by
               joint consent, they tarried there a great while to the exceeding great
               delight of both. Indeed the lady, finding her lover's kisses smack
               much better than those of her husband, converted her asperity into
               sweetness, and from that day forth cherished a most tender love for
               Ricciardo; whereof, using all circumspection, they many a time had
               solace. God grant us solace of ours.

               richly deserving to have his desire, found Fortune nevertheless adverse,
               as she is wont to be to the prosperous. Inasmuch as, for some reason
               or another, the lady, having shewn herself gracious towards Tedaldo
               for a while, completely altered her mien, and not only shewed him no
               further favour, but would not so much as receive a message from him
               or suffer him to see her face; whereby he fell a prey to a grievous
               and distressful melancholy; but so well had he concealed his love
               that the cause of his melancholy was surmised by none. He tried
               hard in divers ways to recover the love which he deemed himself to
               have lost for no fault of his, and finding all his efforts unavailing, he
               resolved to bid the world adieu, that he might not afford her
               who was the cause of his distress the satisfaction of seeing him
               languish. So he got together as much money as he might, and
               secretly, no word said to friend or kinsman except only a familiar
               gossip, who knew all, he took his departure for <span class="place">Ancona</span>. Arrived
               there, he assumed the name of <span class="person">Filippo</span> Santodeccio, and having
               forgathered with a rich merchant, entered his service. The merchant
               took him with him to <span class="place">Cyprus</span> aboard one of his ships, and was so well
               pleased with his bearing and behaviour that he not only gave him a
               handsome salary but made him in a sort his companion, and entrusted
               him with the management of no small part of his affairs: wherein he
               proved himself so apt and assiduous, that in the course of a few years
               he was himself established in credit and wealth and great repute as a
               merchant. Seven years thus passed, during which, albeit his thoughts
               frequently reverted to his cruel mistress, and sorely love smote him,
               and much he yearned to see her again, yet such was his firmness that
               he came off conqueror, until one day in <span class="place">Cyprus</span> it so befell that
               there was sung in his hearing a song that he had himself composed,
               and of which the theme was the mutual love that was between his
               lady and him, and the delight that he had of her; which as he heard,
               he found it incredible that she should have forgotten him, and burned
               with such a desire to see her once more, that, being able to hold out
               no longer, he made up his mind to return to <span class="place">Florence</span>. So, having
               set all his affairs in order, he betook him, attended only by a single
               servant, to <span class="place">Ancona</span>; whence he sent all his effects, as they arrived,
               forward to <span class="place">Florence</span>, consigning them to a friend of his Ancontan
               partner, and followed with his servant in the disguise of a pilgrim
               returned from the <span class="place">Holy Sepulchre</span>. Arrived at <span class="place">Florence</span>, he put
               up at a little hostelry kept by two brothers hard by his lady's house,
               whither he forthwith hied him, hoping that, perchance, he might
               have sight of her from the street; but, finding all barred and
               bolted, doors, windows and all else, he doubted much, she must be
               dead, or have removed thence. So, with a very heavy heart, he
               returned to the house of the two brothers, and to his great surprise
               found his own four brothers standing in front of it, all in black. He
               knew that he was so changed from his former semblance, both in dress
               and in person, that he might not readily be recognized, and he had
               therefore no hesitation in going up to a shoemaker and asking him
               why these men were all dressed in black. The shoemaker answered:
               'Tis because 'tis not fifteen days since a brother of theirs, Tedaldo
               	by name, that had been long abroad, was slain; and I understand
               	that they have proved in court that one Aldobrandino Palermini,
               	who is under arrest, did the deed, because Tedaldo, who loved his
               	wife, was come back to <span class="place">Florence</span> incognito to forgather with her.
               Tedaldo found it passing strange that there should be any one so
               like him as to be mistaken for him, and deplored Aldobrandino's evil
               plight. He had learned, however, that the lady was alive and well.
               So, as 'twas now night, he hied him, much perplexed in mind, into
               the inn, and supped with his servant. The bedroom assigned him
               was almost at the top of the house, and the bed was none of the
               best. Thoughts many and disquieting haunted his mind, and his
               supper had been but light. Whereby it befell that midnight came and
               went, and Tedaldo was still awake. As thus he watched, he heard
               shortly after midnight, a noise as of persons descending from the roof
               into the house, and then through the chinks of the door of his room
               he caught the flicker of an ascending light. Wherefore he stole
               softly to the door, and peeping through a chink to make out what
               was afoot, he saw a very fine young woman bearing a light, and three
               men making towards her, being evidently those that had descended
               from the roof. The men exchanged friendly greetings with the
               young woman, and then one said to her: 
               Now, God be praised,
               we may make our minds easy, for we are well assured that judgment
               for the death of Tedaldo Elisei is gotten by his brothers against
               Aldobrandino Palermini, and he has confessed, and the sentence is
               already drawn up; but still it behoves us to hold our peace; for,
               should it ever get abroad that we were guilty, we shall stand in the
               like jeopardy as Aldobrandino. So saying, they took leave of the
               woman, who seemed much cheered, and went to bed. 
               What he
               had heard set Tedaldo musing on the number and variety of the
               errors to which men are liable: as, first, how his brothers had
               mourned and interred a stranger in his stead, and then charged an
               innocent man upon false suspicion, and by false witness brought him
               into imminent peril of death: from which he passed to ponder the
               blind severity of laws and magistrates, who from misguided zeal to
               elicit the truth not unfrequently become ruthless, and, adjudging that
               which is false, forfeit the title which they claim of ministers of
               God and justice, and do but execute the mandates of iniquity and
               the Evil One. And so he came at last to consider the possibility
               of saving Aldobrandino, and formed a plan for the purpose. Accordingly,
               on the morrow, when he was risen, he left his servant at the
               inn, and hied him alone, at what he deemed a convenient time, to
               his lady's house, where, finding, by chance, the door open, he entered,
               and saw his lady sitting, all tears and lamentations, in a little parlour
               on the ground-floor. Whereat he all but wept for sympathy; and
               drawing near her, he said: 
               Madam, be not troubled in spirit: your peace is nigh you. 
               Whereupon the lady raised her head, and said
               between her sobs: Good man, what dost thou, a pilgrim, if I
               mistake not, from distant parts, know either of my peace or of my
               affliction? 
               Madam, returned the pilgrim, I am of <span class="place">Constantinople</span>,
               and am but now come hither, at God's behest, that I may give
               you laughter for tears, and deliver your husband from death. 
               But,
               said the lady, if thou art of <span class="place">Constantinople</span>, and but now arrived,
               how is 't that thou knowest either who my husband is, or who I
               am? 
               Whereupon the pilgrim gave her the whole narrative, from
               the very beginning, of Aldobrandino's sufferings; he also told her,
               who she was, how long she had been married, and much besides that
               was known to him of her affairs: whereat the lady was lost in
               wonder, and, taking him to be a prophet, threw herself on her knees
               at his feet, and besought him for God's sake, if he were come to save
               Aldobrandino, to lose no time, for the matter brooked no delay. Thus
               adjured, the pilgrim assumed an air of great sanctity, as he said:
               Arise, Madam, weep not, but hearken diligently to what I shall
               say to you, and look to it that you impart it to none. I have it by
               revelation of God that the tribulation wherein you stand is come
               upon you in requital of a sin which you did once commit, of which
               God is minded that this suffering be a partial purgation, and that you
               make reparation in full, if you would not find yourself in a far
               more grievous plight. 
               Sir, replied the lady, many sins have I
               committed, nor know I how among them all to single out that
               whereof, more than another, God requires reparation at my hands:
               wherefore, if you know it, tell it me, and what by way of reparation
               I may do, that will I do. 
               Madam, returned the pilgrim, well
               wot I what it is, nor shall I question you thereof for my better
               instruction, but that the rehearsal may give you increase of remorse
               therefor. But pass we now to fact. Tell me, mind you ever to
               have had a lover? 
               Whereat the lady heaved a deep sigh; then,
               marvelling not a little, for she had thought 'twas known to none,
               albeit on the day when the man was slain, who was afterwards buried
               as Tedaldo, there had been some buzz about it, occasioned by some
               indiscreet words dropped by Tedaldo's gossip and confidant, she made
               answer: 
               I see that there is nought that men keep secret but God
               reveals it to you; wherefore I shall not endeavour to hide my secrets
               from you. True it is that in my youth I was beyond measure
               enamoured of the unfortunate young man whose death is imputed to
               my husband; whom I mourned with grief unfeigned, for, albeit I
               shewed myself harsh and cruel towards him before his departure, yet
               neither thereby, nor by his long absence, nor yet by his calamitous
               death was my heart estranged from him. Then said the pilgrim:
               'Twas not the unfortunate young man now dead that you did love,
               but Tedaldo Elisei. But let that pass; now tell me: wherefore lost
               he your good graces? Did he ever offend you? 
               Nay verily,
               answered the lady, he never offended me at all. My harshness was
               prompted by an accursed friar, to whom I once confessed, and who,
               when I told him of the love I bore Tedaldo, and my intimacy with
               him, made my ears so tingle and sing that I still shudder to think of
               it, warning me that, if I gave it not up, I should fall into the jaws of
               the Devil in the abyss of hell, and be cast into the avenging fire.
               Whereby I was so terrified that I quite made my mind up to discontinue
               my intimacy with him, and, to trench the matter, I would
               thenceforth have none of his letters or messages; and so, I suppose,
               he went away in despair, though I doubt not, had he persevered a
               while longer, I should not have seen him wasting away like snow in
               sunshine without relenting of my harsh resolve; for in sooth there
               was nothing in the world I would so gladly have done. 
               Then said
               the pilgrim: Madam, 'tis this sin, and this only, that has brought
               upon you your present tribulation. I know positively that Tedaldo
               did never put force upon you: 'twas of your own free will, and for
               that he pleased you, that you became enamoured of him: your
               constant visitor, your intimate friend he became, because you yourself
               would have it so; and in the course of your intimacy you shewed
               him such favour by word and deed that, if he loved you first, you
               multiplied his love full a thousandfold. And if so it was, and well
               yourself from him? You should have considered the whole matter
               before the die was cast, and not have entered upon it, if you deemed
               you might have cause to repent you of it as a sin. As soon as he
               became yours, you became his. Had he not been yours, you might
               have acted as you had thought fit, at your own unfettered discretion;
               but, as you were his, 'twas robbery, 'twas conduct most disgraceful,
               to sever yourself from him against his will. Now you must know
               that I am a friar; and therefore all the ways of friars are familiar to
               me; nor does it misbecome me, as it might another, to speak for
               your behoof somewhat freely of them; as I am minded to do that
               you may have better understanding of them in the future than you
               would seem to have had in the past. Time was when the friars were
               most holy and worthy men, but those who to-day take the name and
               claim the reputation of friars have nought of the friar save only the
               habit: nay, they have not even that: for, whereas their founders
               ordained that their habits should be strait, of a sorry sort, and of
               coarse stuff, apt symbols of a soul that in arraying the body in so mean
               a garb did despite to all things temporal, our modern friars will have
               them full, and double, and resplendent, and of the finest stuff, and of
               a fashion goodly and pontifical, wherein without shame they flaunt it
               like peacocks in the church, in the piazza, even as do the laity in their
               robes. And as the fisherman casts his net into the stream with
               intent to take many fish at one throw: so 'tis the main solicitude and
               study, art and craft of these friars to embrace and entangle within
               the ample folds of their vast swelling skirts beguines, widows and
               other foolish women, ay, and men likewise in great number. Wherefore,
               to speak with more exactitude, the friars of to-day have nought
               of the habit of the friar save only the colour thereof. And, whereas
               the friars of old time sought to win men to their salvation, those of
               to-day seek to win their women and their wealth; wherefore they
               have made it and make it their sole concern by declamation and
               imagery to strike terror into the souls of fools, and to make believe
               that sins are purged by alms and masses; to the end that they, base
               wretches that have fled to friarage not to ensue holiness but to escape
               hardship, may receive from this man bread, from that man wine, and
               from the other man a donation for masses for the souls of his dead.
               True indeed it is that sins are purged by almsgiving and prayer; but,
               did they who give the alms know, did they but understand to whom
               or throw them to so many pigs. And, knowing that the fewer be
               they that share great riches, the greater their ease, 'tis the study of
               each how best by declamation and intimidation to oust others from
               that whereof he would fain be the sole owner. They censure lust in
               men, that, they turning therefrom, the sole use of their women may
               remain to the censors: they condemn usury and unlawful gains,
               that, being entrusted with the restitution thereof, they may be able
               to enlarge their habits, and to purchase bishoprics and other great
               preferments with the very money which they have made believe must
               bring its possessor to perdition. And when they are taxed with these
               and many other discreditable practices, they deem that there is no
               censure, however grave, of which they may not be quit by their glib
               formula: 'Follow our precepts, not our practice:' as if'twere possible
               that the sheep should be of a more austere and rigid virtue than the
               shepherds. And how many of these, whom they put off with this
               formula, understand it not in the way in which they enunciate it, not
               a few of them know. The friars of to-day would have you follow
               their precepts, that is to say, they would have you fill their purses
               with coin, confide to them your secrets, practise continence, be
               long-suffering,
               forgive those that trespass against you, keep yourselves from
               evil speaking; all which things are good, seemly, holy. But to what
               end? To the end that they may be able to do that which, if the
               laity do it, they will not be able to do. Who knows not that idleness
               cannot subsist without money? Spend thy money on thy pleasures,
               and the friar will not be able to live in sloth in his order. Go after
               women, and there will be no place for the friar. Be not long-suffering,
               pardon not the wrong-doer, and the friar will not dare to
               cross thy threshold to corrupt thy family. But wherefore pursue I
               the topic through every detail? They accuse themselves as often
               as they so excuse themselves in the hearing of all that have understanding.
               Why seclude they not themselves, if they misdoubt
               their power to lead continent and holy lives? Or if they must
               needs not live as recluses, why follow they not that other holy
               text of the Gospel: Christ began to do and to teach?As pointed out by
               Mr. Payne, these words are not from any of the
               Gospels, but from the first verse of the Acts of the Apostles. Boccaccio
               doubtless used <span class="person">Evangelio</span> in a large sense for the whole of the New
               Testament. 
               Let
               them practise first, and school us with their precepts afterwards. A
               thousand such have I seen in my day, admirers, lovers, philanderers,
               not of ladies of the world alone, but of nuns; ay, and they too such as
               made the most noise in the pulpits. Is it such as they that we are to
               follow? He that does so, pleases himself; but God knows if he do
               wisely. But assume that herein we must allow that your censor, the
               friar, spoke truth, to wit, that none may break the marriage-vow
               without very grave sin. What then? to rob a man, to slay him, to
               make of him an exile and a wanderer on the face of the earth, are not
               these yet greater sins? None will deny that so they are. A woman
               that indulges herself in the intimate use with a man commits but a
               sin of nature; but if she rob him, or slay him, or drive him out into
               exile, her sin proceeds from depravity of spirit. That you did rob
               Tedaldo, I have already shewn you, in that, having of your own free
               will become his, you reft you from him. I now go further and say
               that, so far as in you lay, you slew him, seeing that, shewing yourself
               ever more and more cruel, you did your utmost to drive him to take
               his own life; and in the law's intent he that is the cause that wrong
               is done is as culpable as he that does it. Nor is it deniable that you
               were the cause that for seven years he has been an exile and a
               wanderer upon the face of the earth. Wherefore upon each of the
               said three articles you are found guilty of a greater crime than you
               committed by your intimacy with him. But consider we the matter
               more closely: perchance Tedaldo merited such treatment: nay, but
               assuredly 'twas not so. You have yourself so confessed: besides
               which I know that he loves you more dearly than himself. He
               would laud, he would extol, he would magnify you above all other
               ladies so as never was heard the like, wheresoever 'twas seemly for
               him to speak of you, and it might be done without exciting suspicion.
               All his bliss, all his honour, all his liberty he avowed was entirely in
               your disposal. Was he not of noble birth? And for beauty might
               he not compare with the rest of his townsfolk? Did he not excel in
               all the exercises and accomplishments proper to youth? Was he not
               beloved, held dear, well seen of all men? You will not deny it.
               How then could you at the behest of a paltry friar, silly, brutish and
               envious, bring yourself to deal with him in any harsh sort? I cannot
               estimate the error of those ladies who look askance on men and hold
               them cheap; whereas, bethinking them of what they are themselves,
               and what and how great is the nobility with which God has endowed
               man above all the other animals, they ought rather to glory in the
               love which men give them, and hold them most dear, and with all
               zeal study to please them, that so their love may never fail. In what
               sort you did so, instigated by the chatter of a friar, some broth-guzzling,
               pastry-gorging knave without a doubt, you know; and peradventure
               his purpose was but to instal himself in the place whence he sought
               to oust another. This then is the sin which the Divine justice,
               which, ever operative, suffers no perturbation of its even balance,
               or arrest of judgment, has decreed not to leave unpunished: wherefore,
               as without due cause you devised how you might despoil
               Tedaldo of yourself, so without due cause your husband has been
               placed and is in jeopardy of his life on Tedaldo's account, and to
               your sore affliction. Wherefrom if you would be delivered, there
               is that which you must promise, ay, and (much more) which you
               must perform: to wit, that, should it ever betide that Tedaldo return
               hither from his long exile, you will restore to him your favour, your
               love, your tender regard, your intimacy, and reinstate him in the
               position which he held before you foolishly hearkened to the half-witted
               friar.
            </p>
            <p>Thus ended the pilgrim; and the lady, who had followed him
               with the closest attention, deeming all that he advanced very sound,
               and doubting not that her tribulation was, as he said, in requital of her
               sin, spoke thus: 
               Friend of God, well I wot that the matters
               which you discourse are true, and, thanks to your delineation, I now
               in great measure know what manner of men are the friars, whom
               I have hitherto regarded as all alike holy; nor doubt I that great
               was my fault in the course which I pursued towards Tedaldo; and
               gladly, were it in my power, would I make reparation in the manner
               which you have indicated. But how is this feasible? Tedaldo can
               never return to us. He is dead. Wherefore I know not why I
               must needs give you a promise which cannot be performed.
               Madam, returned the pilgrim, 'tis revealed to me by God
               that Tedaldo is by no means dead, but alive and well and happy,
               so only he enjoyed your favour. 
               Nay, but, said the lady, speak
               advisedly; I saw his body done to death by more than one knife-wound;
               I folded it in these arms, and drenched the dead face with
               many a tear; whereby, perchance, I gave occasion for the bruit that
               has been made to my disadvantage. 
               Say what you may, Madam,
               rejoined the pilgrim, I assure you that Tedaldo lives, and if you will
               but give the promise, then, for its fulfilment, I have good hope that
               you will soon see him. 
               Whereupon: I give the promise,
               said the lady, and right gladly will I make it good; nor is there
               aught that might happen that would yield me such delight as to see
               my husband free and scatheless, and Tedaldo alive. 
               Tedaldo now
               deemed it wise to make himself known, and establish the lady in a
               more sure hope of her husband's safety. Wherefore he said:
               Madam, to set your mind at ease in regard of your husband, I
               must first impart to you a secret, which be mindful to disclose to
               none so long as you live. 
               Then--for such was the confidence
               which the lady reposed in the pilgrim's apparent sanctity that they
               were by themselves in a place remote from observation--Tedaldo
               drew forth a ring which he had guarded with the most jealous care,
               since it had been given him by the lady on the last night when they
               were together, and said, as he shewed it to her: Madam, know
               you this? 
               The lady recognized it forthwith, and answered: I
               do, Sir; I gave it long ago to Tedaldo. 
               Then the pilgrim, rising
               and throwing off his sclavineSchiavina, Low Lat.
               sclavina, the long coarse frock worn, among
               others, by palmers. and hat, said with the Florentine
               accent: And know you me? 
               The lady recognizing forthwith
               the form and semblance of Tedaldo, was struck dumb with wonder
               and fear as of a corpse that is seen to go about as if alive, and was
               much rather disposed to turn and flee from Tedaldo returned from
               the tomb than to come forward and welcome Tedaldo arrived from
               <span class="place">Cyprus</span>. 
               But when Tedaldo said to her: Fear not, Madam, your
               Tedaldo am I, alive and well, nor was I ever dead, whatever you
               and my brothers may think, 
               the lady, partly awed, partly reassured
               by his voice, regarded him with rather more attention, and inly
               affirming that 'twas in very truth Tedaldo, threw herself upon his
               neck, and wept, and kissed him, saying: Sweet my Tedaldo,
               welcome home. 
               Madam, replied Tedaldo after he had kissed
               and embraced her, time serves not now for greetings more intimate.
               'Tis for me to be up and doing, that Aldobrandino may be restored
               to you safe and sound; touching which matter you will, I trust,
               before to-morrow at even hear tidings that will gladden your heart;
               indeed I expect to have good news to-night, and, if so, will come
               and tell it you, when I shall be less straitened than I am at present.
               He then resumed his sclavine and that, and having kissed the lady
               again, and bade her be of good cheer, took his leave, and hied him to
               the prison, where Aldobrandino lay more occupied with apprehension
               of imminent death than hope of deliverance to come. As ministrant
               of consolation, he gained ready admittance of the warders, and, seating
               himself by Aldobrandino's side, he said: 
               Aldobrandino, in me
               thou seest a friend sent thee by God, who is touched with pity of
               thee by reason of thy innocence; wherefore, if in reverent submission
               to Him thou wilt grant me a slight favour that I shall ask of thee,
               without fail, before to-morrow at even, thou shalt, in lieu of the
               doom of death that thou awaitest, hear thy acquittal pronounced.
               Worthy man, replied Aldobrandino, I know thee not, nor mind
               I ever to have seen thee; wherefore, as thou shewest thyself solicitous
               for my safety, my friend indeed thou must needs be, even as thou
               sayst. And in sooth the crime, for which they say I ought to be
               doomed to death, I never committed, though others enough I have
               committed, which perchance have brought me to this extremity.
               However, if so be that God has now pity on me, this I tell thee
               in reverent submission to Him, that, whereas 'tis but a little thing
               that thou cravest of me, there is nought, however great, but I would
               not only promise but gladly do it; wherefore, even ask what thou
               wilt, and, if so be that I escape, I will without fail keep my word to
               the letter. 
               Nay, returned the pilgrim, I ask but this of thee,
               that thou pardon Tedaldo's four brothers, that in the belief that thou
               wast guilty of their brother's death they brought thee to this strait, and,
               so they ask thy forgiveness, account them as thy brothers and friends.
               How sweet, replied Aldobrandino, is the savour, how ardent the
               desire, of vengeance, none knows but he that is wronged; but yet, so
               God may take thought for my deliverance, I will gladly pardon, nay,
               I do now pardon them, and if I go hence alive and free, I will thenceforth
               have them in such regard as shall content thee. 
               Satisfied with
               this answer, the pilgrim, without further parley, heartily exhorted
               Aldobrandino to be of good cheer; assuring him that, before the next
               day was done, he should be certified beyond all manner of doubt of
               his deliverance; and so he left him.
            </p>
            <p>On quitting the prison the pilgrim hied him forthwith to the
               signory, and being closeted with a knight that was in charge, thus
               spoke: My lord, 'tis the duty of all, and most especially of those
               who hold your place, zealously to bestir themselves that the truth be
               brought to light, in order as well that those bear not the penalty
               who have not committed the crime, as that the guilty be punished.
               And that this may come to pass to your honour and the undoing
               of the delinquent, I am come hither to you. You wot that you
               have dealt rigorously with Aldobrandino Palermini, and have found,
               as you think, that 'twas he that slew Tedaldo Elisei, and you are
               about to condemn him; wherein you are most certainly in error, as
               I doubt not before midnight to prove to you, delivering the murderers
               into your hands. 
               The worthy knight, who was not without pity
               for Aldobrandino, readily gave ear to the pilgrim's words. He
               conversed at large with him, and availing himself of his guidance,
               made an easy capture of the two brothers that kept the inn and their
               servant in their first sleep. He was about to put them the torture, to
               elicit the true state of the case, when, their courage failing, they
               confessed without the least reserve, severally at first, and then jointly,
               that 'twas they that had slain Tedaldo Elisei, not knowing who he
               was. Asked for why, they answered that 'twas because he had
               sorely harassed the wife of one of them, and would have constrained
               her to do his pleasure, while they were out of doors. Whereof the
               pilgrim was no sooner apprised, than by leave of the knight he withdrew,
               and hied him privily to the house of Madonna Ermellina, whom
               (the rest of the household being gone to bed) he found awaiting him
               alone, and equally anxious for good news of her husband and a
               complete reconciliation with her Tedaldo. On entering, he blithely
               exclaimed: Rejoice, dearest my lady, for thou mayst rest assured
               that to-morrow thou shalt have thy Aldobrandino back here safe and
               sound; and to confirm her faith in his words, he told her all that
               he had done. Greater joy was never woman's than hers of two such
               glad surprises; to wit, to have Tedaldo with her alive again, whom
               she had wailed for verily dead, and to know Aldobrandino, whom she
               had thought in no long time to wail for dead, now out of jeopardy.
               Wherefore, when she had affectionately embraced and kissed her
               Tedaldo, they hied them to bed together, and with hearty goodwill
               made gracious and gladsome consummation of their peace by
               interchange of sweet solace.
            </p>
            <p>With the approach of day Tedaldo rose, and having first apprised
               the lady of his purpose and enjoined her, as before, to keep it most
               secret, resumed his pilgrim's habit, and sallied forth of her house,
               to be ready, as occasion should serve, to act in Aldobrandino's interest.
               As soon as 'twas day, the signory, deeming themselves amply conversant
               with the affair, set Aldobrandino at large; and a few days
               later they caused the malefactors to be beheaded in the place where
               they had done the murder.
            </p>
            <p>Great was Aldobrandino's joy to find himself free, nor less great
               was that of his lady and all his friends and kinsfolk; and as 'twas
               through the pilgrim that it had come about, they brought him to
               their house, there to reside as long as he cared to tarry in the city;
               nor could they do him honour and cheer enough, and most of all the
               lady, who knew her man. But after a while, seeing that his brothers
               were not only become a common laughing-stock by reason of Aldobrandino's
               acquittal, but had armed themselves for very fear, he felt
               that their reconciliation with him brooked no delay, and accordingly
               craved of him performance of his promise. Aldobrandino replied
               handsomely that it should be had at once. The pilgrim then bade
               him arrange for the following day a grand banquet, at which he and his
               kinsfolk and their ladies were to entertain the four brothers and their
               ladies, adding that he would himself go forthwith as Aldobrandino's
               envoy, and bid them welcome to his peace and banquet. All which
               being approved by Aldobrandino, the pilgrim hied him with all speed
               to the four brothers, whom by ample, apt and unanswerable argument
               he readily induced to reinstate themselves in Aldobrandino's friendship
               by suing for his forgiveness: which done, he bade them and their
               ladies to breakfast with Aldobrandino on the morrow, and they, being
               assured of his good faith, were consenting to come. So, on the
               morrow, at the breakfast hour, Tedaldo's four brothers, still wearing
               their black, came with certain of their friends to Aldobrandino's house,
               where he awaited them; and, in presence of the company that had
               been bidden to meet them, laid down their arms, and made surrender
               to Aldobrandino, asking his pardon of that which they had done
               against him. Aldobrandino received them compassionately, wept,
               kissed each on the mouth, and let few words suffice to remit each
               offence. After them came their sisters and their wives, all habited
               sadly, and were graciously received by Madonna Ermellina and the
               other ladies. The guests, men and women alike, found all things
               ordered at the banquet with magnificence, nor aught unmeet for
               commendation save the restraint which the yet recent grief, betokened
               by the sombre garb of Tedaldo's kinsfolk, laid upon speech (wherein
               some had found matter to except against the banquet and the pilgrim
               for devising it, as he well knew), but, as he had premeditated, in due
               time, he stood up, the others being occupied with their dessert, and
               spoke thus: 
               Nothing is wanting to complete the gaiety of this
               banquet except the presence of Tedaldo; whom, as you have been
               long time with him and have not known him, I will point out to
               you. 
               So, having divested himself of his sclavine and whatever else
               in his garb denoted the pilgrim, he remained habited in a tunic of
               green taffeta, in which guise, so great was the wonder with which all
               regarded him that, though they recognized him, 'twas long before
               any dared to believe that 'twas actually Tedaldo. 
               Marking their
               surprise, Tedaldo told them not a little about themselves, their family
               connexions, their recent history, and his own adventures. Whereat
               his brothers and the rest of the men, all weeping for joy, hasted to
               embrace him, followed by the women, as well those that were not, as
               those that were, of kin to him, save only Madonna Ermellina. Which
               Aldobrandino observing, said: What is this, Ermellina? How
               comes it that, unlike the other ladies, thou alone dost Tedaldo no
               cheer?
               Cheer, replied the lady in the hearing of all, would I
               gladly do him such as no other woman has done or could do, seeing
               that I am more beholden to him than any other woman, in that to
               him I owe it that I have thee with me again; 'tis but the words
               spoken to my disadvantage, while we mourned him that we deemed
               Tedaldo, that give me pause. 
               Now out upon thee, said
               Aldobrandino,
               thinkest thou that I heed the yelping of these curs?
               His zeal for my deliverance has abundantly disproved it, besides which
               I never believed it. Quick, get thee up, and go and embrace him.
               The lady, who desired nothing better, was in this not slow to obey
               her husband; she rose forthwith, and embraced Tedaldo as the other
               ladies had done, and did him gladsome cheer. Tedaldo's brothers
               and all the company, men and women alike, heartily approved Aldobrandino's
               handsomeness; and so whatever of despite the rumour had
               engendered in the minds of any was done away. And, now that all
               had done him cheer, Tedaldo with his own hands rent his brothers'
               suits of black upon their backs, as also the sad-hued garments which
               his sisters and sisters-in-law wore, and bade bring other apparel. Which
               when they had donned, there was no lack of singing, dancing and
               other sorts of merry-making; whereby the banquet, for all its subdued
               beginning, had a sonorous close. Then, just as they were, in the
               blithest of spirits, they hied them all to Tedaldo's house, where in
               the evening they supped; and in this manner they held festival for
               several days.
            </p>
            <p>'Twas some time before the Florentines ceased to look on Tedaldo
               as a portent, as if he were risen from the dead; and a shadow of doubt
               whether he were really Tedaldo or no continued to lurk in the minds
               of not a few, including even his brothers: they had no assured belief;
               and in that frame had perchance long continued, but for a casual
               occurrence that shewed them who the murdered man was. It so
               befell that one day some men-at-arms from <span class="place">Lunigiana</span> passed by their
               house, and seeing Tedaldo accosted him, saying: Good-morrow to
               thee, Faziuolo. 
               To whom Tedaldo, in the presence of his brothers,
               answered: You take me for another. Whereat they were abashed,
               and asked his pardon, saying: Sooth to tell, you are liker than we
               ever knew any man like to another to a comrade of ours, Faziuolo da
               Pontremoli by name, who came hither a fortnight ago, or perhaps a
               little more, since when we have not been able to learn what became
               of him. Most true it is that your dress surprised us, because he, like
               ourselves, was a soldier. 
               Whereupon Tedaldo's eldest brother came
               forward, and asked how their comrade had been accoutred. They
               told him, and 'twas found to have been exactly as they said: by which
               and other evidence 'twas established that 'twas Faziuolo that had been
               murdered, and not Tedaldo; of whom thenceforth no suspicion
               lurked in the minds of his brothers or any one else.
            </p>
            <p>So, then, Tedaldo returned home very rich, and remained constant
               in his love; nor did the lady again treat him harshly; but, using
               discretion, they long had mutual solace of their love. God grant us
               solace of ours.

            <p>Know then that there was and still is in <span class="place">Tuscany</span> an abbey,
               situate, as we see not a few, in a somewhat solitary spot, wherein the
               office of abbot was held by a monk, who in all other matters ordered
               his life with great sanctity, save only in the commerce with women,
               and therein knew so well how to cloak his indulgence, that scarce any
               there were that so much as suspected--not to say detected it--so
               holy and just was he reputed in all matters. Now the abbot consorted
               much with a very wealthy contadino, <span class="person">Ferondo</span> by name, a
               man coarse and gross beyond measure, whose friendship the abbot
               only cared for because of the opportunities which it afforded of
               deriving amusement from his simplicity; and during their intercourse
               the abbot discovered that <span class="person">Ferondo</span> had a most beautiful wife; of
               whom he became so hotly enamoured that he could think of nought
               else either by day or by night. But learning that, however simple
               and inept in all other matters, <span class="person">Ferondo</span> shewed excellent good sense
               in cherishing and watching over this wife of his, he almost despaired.
               However, being very astute, he prevailed so far with <span class="person">Ferondo</span>, that he
               would sometimes bring his wife with him to take a little recreation
               in the abbey-garden, where he discoursed to them with all lowliness
               of the blessedness of life eternal, and the most pious works of many
               men and women of times past, insomuch that the lady conceived a
               desire to confess to him, and craved and had <span class="person">Ferondo</span>'s leave therefor.
               So, to the abbot's boundless delight, the lady came and seated herself
               at his feet to make her confession, whereto she prefixed the following
               exordium: 
               If God, Sir, had given me a husband, or had not permitted
               me to have one, perchance 'twould be easy for me, under your
               guidance, to enter the way, of which you have spoken, that leads to
               life eternal. But, considering what manner of man <span class="person">Ferondo</span> is, and
               his stupidity, I may call myself a widow, while yet I am married in
               that, so long as he lives, I may have no other husband; and he,
               fool that he is, is without the least cause so inordinately jealous of
               me that 'tis not possible but that my life with him be one of perpetual
               tribulation and woe. Wherefore, before I address myself to make
               further confession, I in all humility beseech you to be pleased to give
               me some counsel of this matter, for here or nowhere is to be found
               the source of the amelioration of my life, and if it be not found,
               neither confession nor any other good work will be of any avail.
               The abbot was overjoyed to hear her thus speak, deeming that
               Fortune had opened a way to the fulfilment of his heart's desire.
               Wherefore he said: My daughter, I doubt not that 'tis a great
               affliction to a lady, fair and delicate as you are, to have a fool for a
               husband, and still more so that he should be jealous: and as your
               husband is both the one and the other, I readily credit what you say
               of your tribulation. But, to come to the point, I see no resource or
               remedy in this case, save this only, that <span class="person">Ferondo</span> be cured of his
               jealousy. The medicine that shall cure him I know very well how
               to devise, but it behoves you to keep secret what I am about to tell
               you. 
               Doubt not of it, my father, said the lady; for I had
               rather suffer death than tell any aught that you forbade me to tell.
               But the medicine, how is it to be devised? 
               If we would have
               him cured, replied the abbot, it can only be by his going to
               purgatory.
               And how may that be? returned the lady; can he go
               thither while he yet lives? 
               He must die, answered the abbot;
               and so he will go thither; and when he has suffered pain enough to
               be cured of his jealousy, we have certain prayers with which we will
               supplicate God to restore him to life, and He will do so. 
               Then,
               said the lady; am I to remain a widow? 
               Yes, replied the
               abbot, for a certain time, during which you must be very careful
               not to let yourself be married to another, because 'twould offend God,
               and when <span class="person">Ferondo</span> was restored to life, you would have to go back to
               him, and he would be more jealous than ever. 
               Be it so then,
               said the lady; if he be but cured of his jealousy, and so I be not
               doomed to pass the rest of my days in prison, I shall be content: do
               as you think best. 
               And so will I, said the abbot; but what
               reward shall I have for such a service? 
               My father, said the
               lady, what you please; so only it be in my power. But what may
               the like of me do that may be acceptable to a man such as you?'
                Madam, replied the abbot, 'tis in your power to do no less for
               me than I am about to do for you: as that which I am minded to do
               will ensure your comfort and consolation, so there is that which you
               may do which will be the deliverance and salvation of my life. 
               If
               so it be, said the lady, I shall not be found wanting. 
               In that
               case, said the abbot, you will give me your love, and gratify my
               passion for you, with which I am all afire and wasting away.
               Whereto the lady, all consternation, replied: Alas! my father, what
               is this you crave? I took you for a holy man; now does it beseem
               holy men to make such overtures to ladies that come to them for
               counsel? 
               Marvel not, fair my soul, returned the abbot; 
               	hereby
               	  is my holiness in no wise diminished, for holiness resides in the
               	  soul, and this which I ask of you is but a sin of the flesh. But, however
               	  it may be, such is the might of your bewitching beauty, that
               	  love constrains me thus to act. And, let me tell you, good cause
               	  have you to vaunt you of your beauty more than other women, in
               	  that it delights the saints, who are used to contemplate celestial
               	  beauties; whereto I may add that, albeit I am an abbot, yet I am a
               	  man even as others, and, as you see, not yet old. Nor need this
               	  matter seem formidable to you, but rather to be anticipated with
               	  pleasure, for, while <span class="person">Ferondo</span> is in purgatory, I shall be your nightly
               	  companion, and will give you such solace as he should have given you;
               	  nor will it ever be discovered by any, for all think of me even as you
               	  did a while ago, or even more so. Reject not the grace that God
               	  accords you; for 'tis in your power to have, and, if you are wise and
               	  follow my advice, you shall have that which women not a few desire
               	  in vain to have. And moreover I have jewels fair and rare, which I
               	  am minded shall be yours and none other's. Wherefore, sweet my
               	  hope, deny me not due guerdon of the service which I gladly render
               	  you.
               
            </p>
            <p>The lady, her eyes still downcast, knew not how to deny him,
               and yet scrupled to gratify him: wherefore the abbot, seeing that
               she had hearkened and hesitated to answer, deemed that she was
               already half won, and following up what he had said with much more
               to the like effect, did not rest until he had persuaded her that she
               would do well to comply: and so with some confusion she told him
               that she was ready to obey his every behest; but it might not be until
               <span class="person">Ferondo</span> was in purgatory. The abbot, well content, replied: 
               And
               we will send him thither forthwith: do but arrange that he come
               hither to stay with me to-morrow or the day after. Which said, he
               slipped a most beautiful ring on her finger, and dismissed her.
               Pleased with the gift, and expecting more to come, the lady rejoined
               her attendants, with whom she forthwith fell a talking marvellous
               things of the abbot's sanctity, and so went home with them.
            </p>
            <p>Some few days after, <span class="person">Ferondo</span> being come to the abbey, the abbot
               no sooner saw him than he resolved to send him to purgatory. So he
               selected from among his drugs a powder of marvellous virtue, which
               he had gotten in the Levant from a great prince, who averred that
               'twas wont to be used by the Old Man of the Mountain, when he
               would send any one to or bring him from his paradise, and that,
               without doing the recipient any harm, 'twould induce in him, according
               to the quantity of the dose, a sleep of such duration and quality that,
               while the efficacy of the powder lasted, none would deem him to be
               alive.By the Old Man of the Mountain is meant the head of the
               confraternity
               of hashish-eaters (Assassins), whose chief stronghold was at Alamut in
               <span class="place">Persia</span> (1090-1256). Cf. Marco Polo, ed. Yule, I. cap. xxiii.
               Whereof he took enough to cause a three days' sleep, and
               gave it to <span class="person">Ferondo</span> in his cell in a beaker that had still some wine in
               it, so that he drank it unwittingly: after which he took <span class="person">Ferondo</span> to
               the cloister, and there with some of his monks fell to making merry
               with him and his ineptitudes. In no long time, however, the
               powder so wrought, that <span class="person">Ferondo</span> was seized in the head with a fit
               of somnolence so sudden and violent that he slept as he stood, and
               sleeping fell to the ground. The abbot put on an agitated air, caused
               him to be untrussed, sent for cold water, and had it sprinkled on his
               face, and applied such other remedies as if he would fain call back
               life and sense banished by vapours of the stomach, or some other
               intrusive force; but, as, for all that he and his monks did, <span class="person">Ferondo</span>
               did not revive, they, after feeling his pulse and finding there no
               sign of life, one and all pronounced him certainly dead. Wherefore
               they sent word to his wife and kinsfolk, who came forthwith, and
               mourned a while; after which <span class="person">Ferondo</span> in his clothes was by the
               abbot's order laid in a tomb. The lady went home, saying that
               nothing should ever part her from a little son that she had borne
               <span class="person">Ferondo</span>; and so she occupied herself with the care of her son and
               <span class="person">Ferondo</span>'s estate. At night the abbot rose noiselessly, and with the
               help of a Bolognese monk, in whom he reposed much trust, and who
               was that very day arrived from <span class="place">Bologna</span>, got <span class="person">Ferondo</span> out of the
               tomb, and bore him to a vault, which admitted no light, having been
               made to serve as a prison for delinquent monks; and having stripped
               him of his clothes, and habited him as a monk, they laid him on a
               truss of straw, and left him there until he should revive. Expecting
               which event, and instructed by the abbot how he was then to act,
               the Bolognese monk (none else knowing aught of what was afoot)
               kept watch by the tomb.
            </p>
            <p>The day after, the abbot with some of his monks paid a pastoral
               visit to the lady's house, where he found her in mourning weeds and
               sad at heart; and, after administering a little consolation, he gently
               asked her to redeem her promise. Free as she now felt herself, and
               hampered neither by <span class="person">Ferondo</span> nor by any other, the lady, who had
               noticed another beautiful ring on the abbot's finger, promised immediate
               compliance, and arranged with the abbot that he should visit
               her the very next night. So, at nightfall, the abbot donned <span class="person">Ferondo</span>'s
               clothes, and, attended by his monk, paid his visit, and lay with her
               until matins to his immense delight and solace, and so returned to
               the abbey; and many visits he paid her on the same errand; whereby
               some that met him, coming or going that way, supposed that 'twas
               <span class="person">Ferondo</span> perambulating those parts by way of penance; and fables
               not a few passed from mouth to mouth of the foolish rustics, and
               sometimes reached the ears of the lady, who was at no loss to account
               for them.
            </p>
            <p>As for <span class="person">Ferondo</span>, when he revived, 'twas only to find himself he
               knew not where, while the Bolognese monk entered the tomb, gibbering
               horribly, and armed with a rod, wherewith, having laid hold of
               <span class="person">Ferondo</span>, he gave him a severe thrashing. 
               Blubbering and bellowing
               for pain, <span class="person">Ferondo</span> could only ejaculate: Where am I? 
               In purgatory, replied the monk. 
               How? returned <span class="person">Ferondo</span>, am I dead then? 
               and the monk assuring him that 'twas even so, he
               fell a bewailing his own and his lady's and his son's fate, after the
               most ridiculous fashion in the world. The monk brought him
               somewhat to eat and drink. Of which when <span class="person">Ferondo</span> caught sight,
               Oh! said he, dead folk eat then, do they? 
               They do,
               replied the monk; and this, which I bring thee, is what the lady
               that was thy wife sent this morning to the church by way of alms
               for masses for thy soul; and God is minded that it be assigned to
               thee. 
               Now God grant her a happy year, said <span class="person">Ferondo</span>; dearly
               I loved her while I yet lived, and would hold her all night long in
               my arms, and cease not to kiss her, ay, and would do yet more to her,
               when I was so minded. Whereupon he fell to eating and drinking
               with great avidity, and finding the wine not much to his taste, he
               said: Now God do her a mischief! Why gave she not the priest
               of the wine that is in the cask by the wall? 
               When he had done
               eating, the monk laid hold of him again, and gave him another sound
               thrashing with the rod. 
               <span class="person">Ferondo</span> bellowed mightily, and then cried
               out: Alas! why servest thou me so? 
               God, answered the monk, has decreed that thou be so served twice a day. 
               For why? said <span class="person">Ferondo</span>. 
               Because, returned the monk, thou wast
               jealous, notwithstanding thou hadst to wife a woman that has not her
               peer in thy countryside. 
               Alas, said <span class="person">Ferondo</span>, she was indeed
               all that thou sayst, ay, and the sweetest creature too,--no comfit so
               honeyed--but I knew not that God took it amiss that a man should
               be jealous, or I had not been so. 
               Of that, replied the monk,
               thou shouldst have bethought thee while thou wast there, and have
               amended thy ways; and should it fall to thy lot ever to return thither,
               be sure that thou so lay to heart the lesson that I now give thee, that
               thou be no more jealous. 
               Oh! said <span class="person">Ferondo</span>; dead folk sometimes
               return to earth, do they? 
               They do, replied the monk; if God so will. 
               Oh! said <span class="person">Ferondo</span>; if I ever return, I will
               be the best husband in the world; never will I beat her or scold her,
               save for the wine that she has sent me this morning, and also for
               sending me never a candle, so that I have had perforce to eat in the
               dark. 
               Nay, said the monk, she sent them, but they were burned
               at the masses. 
               Oh! said <span class="person">Ferondo</span>, I doubt not you say true;
               and, of a surety, if I ever return, I will let her do just as she likes.
               But tell me, who art thou that entreatest me thus? 
               Late of
               <span class="place">Sardinia</span> I, answered the monk, dead too; and, for that I gave
               my lord much countenance in his jealousy, doomed by God for
               my proper penance to entreat thee thus with food and drink and
               thrashings, until such time as He may ordain otherwise touching
               thee and me. 
               And are we two the only folk here? inquired
               <span class="person">Ferondo</span>. 
               Nay, there are thousands beside, answered the monk;
               but thou canst neither see nor hear them, nor they thee. 
               And how far, said <span class="person">Ferondo</span>, may we be from our country? 
               Oh! ho! returned the monk, why, 'tis some miles clean out of
               shitrange.
               I'faith, said <span class="person">Ferondo</span>, that is far indeed: methinks we
               must be out of the world.
            </p>
            <p>In such a course, alternately beaten, fed and amused with idle
               tales, was <span class="person">Ferondo</span> kept for ten months, while the abbot, to his great
               felicity, paid many a visit to the fair lady, and had the jolliest time in
               the world with her. But, as misfortunes will happen, the lady
               conceived, which fact, as soon as she was aware of it, she imparted to
               the abbot; whereupon both agreed that <span class="person">Ferondo</span> must without delay
               be brought back from purgatory to earth and her, and be given to
               understand that she was with child of him. So the very next night
               the abbot went to the prison, and in a disguised voice pronounced
               <span class="person">Ferondo</span>'s name, and said to him: <span class="person">Ferondo</span>, be of good cheer, for
               God is minded that thou return to earth; and on thy return thou
               shalt have a son by thy lady, and thou shalt call him Benedetto;
               because 'tis in answer to the prayers of thy holy abbot and thy lady,
               and for love of St. Benedict, that God accords thee this grace.
               Whereat <span class="person">Ferondo</span> was overjoyed, and said: It likes me well.
               God give a good year to Master Lord God, and the abbot, and St.
               Benedict, and my cheese-powdered, honey-sweet wife. 
               Then, in
               the wine that he sent him, the abbot administered enough of the
               powder to cause him to sleep for four hours; and so, with the aid of
               the monk, having first habited him in his proper clothes, he privily
               conveyed him back to the tomb in which he had been buried. On
               the morrow at daybreak <span class="person">Ferondo</span> revived, and perceiving through a
               chink in the tomb a glimmer of light, to which he had been a
               stranger for full ten months, he knew that he was alive, and began
               to bellow: Let me out, let me out: then, setting his head to
               the lid of the tomb, he heaved amain; whereby the lid, being insecure,
               started; and he was already thrusting it aside, when the monks,
               matins being now ended, ran to the spot and recognized <span class="person">Ferondo</span>'s
               voice, and saw him issue from the tomb; by which unwonted event
               they were all so affrighted that they took to flight, and hied them to
               the abbot: who, rising as if from prayer, said: Sons, be not
               afraid; take the cross and the holy water, and follow me, and let us
               see what sign of His might God will vouchsafe us. 
               And so
               he led the way to the tomb; beside which they found <span class="person">Ferondo</span>
               standing, deathly pale by reason of his long estrangement from the
               light. On sight of the abbot he ran and threw himself at his feet,
               saying: My father, it has been revealed to me that 'tis to your
               prayers and those of St. Benedict and my lady that I owe my release
               from purgatorial pain, and restoration to life; wherefore 'tis my
               prayer that God give you a good year and good calends, to-day and
               all days. 
               Laud we the power of God! said the abbot. Go
               then, son, as God has restored thee to earth, comfort thy wife, who,
               since thou didst depart this life, has been ever in tears, and mayst thou
               live henceforth in the love and service of God. 
               Sir, answered
               <span class="person">Ferondo</span>, 'tis well said; and, for the doing, trust me that, as soon as
               I find her, I shall kiss her, such is the love I bear her. So saying,
               he went his way; and the abbot, left alone with his monks, made
               as if he marvelled greatly at the affair, and caused devoutly chant
               the Miserere. So <span class="person">Ferondo</span> returned to his hamlet, where all that
               saw him fleeing, as folk are wont to flee from spectacles of horror,
               he called them back, asseverating that he was risen from the tomb.
               His wife at first was no less timorous: but, as folk began to take heart
               of grace, perceiving that he was alive, they plied him with many
               questions, all which he answered as one that had returned with ripe
               experience, and gave them tidings of the souls of their kinsfolk, and
               told of his own invention the prettiest fables of the purgatorial state,
               and in full folkmoot recounted the revelation vouchsafed him by the
               mouth of Ragnolo BraghielloDerisively for Agnolo Gabriello (the
               h having merely the effect of
               preserving the hardness of the g before i), 
               i.e. Angel Gabriel. before his resuscitation.
            </p>
            <p>Thus was <span class="person">Ferondo</span> reinstated in his property and reunited to his
               wife, who, being pregnant, as he thought, by himself, chanced by
               the time of her delivery to countenance the vulgar error that the
               woman must bear the infant in the womb for exactly nine months,
               and gave birth to a male child, who was named Benedetto Ferondi.
               <span class="person">Ferondo</span>'s return from purgatory, and the report he brought thence,
               immeasurably enhanced the fame of the abbot's holiness. So
               <span class="person">Ferondo</span>, cured of his jealousy by the thrashings which he had gotten
               for it, verified the abbot's prediction, and never offended the lady
               again in that sort. Wherefore she lived with him, as before, in all
               outward seemliness; albeit she failed not, as occasion served, to forgather
               with the holy abbot, who had so well and sedulously served
               her in her especial need.

                  I will tell you a story which seems to me germane to our theme.
               </p>
            </div>
            <p>Know, then, that in the realm of <span class="place">France</span> there was a gentleman,
               Isnard, Comte de Roussillon, by name, who, being in ill-health, kept
               ever in attendance on him a physician, one Master Gerard of Narbonne.
               The said Count had an only son named Bertrand, a very
               fine and winsome little lad; with whom were brought up other
               children of his own age, among them the said physician's little
               daughter Gillette; who with a love boundless and ardent out of all
               keeping with her tender years became enamoured of this Bertrand.
               And so, when the Count died, and his son, being left a ward of the
               King, must needs go to <span class="place">Paris</span>, the girl remained beside herself with
               grief, and, her father dying soon after, would gladly have gone to
               <span class="place">Paris</span> to see Bertrand, might she but have found a fair excuse; but no
               decent pretext could she come by, being left a great and sole heiress
               and very closely guarded. So being come of marriageable age, still
               cherishing Bertrand's memory, she rejected not a few suitors, to
               whom her kinsfolk would fain have married her, without assigning
               any reason.
            </p>
            <p>Now her passion waxing ever more ardent for Bertrand, as she
               learned that he was grown a most goodly gallant, tidings reached
               her that the King of <span class="place">France</span>, in consequence of a tumour which he
               had had in the breast, and which had been ill tended, was now
               troubled with a fistula, which occasioned him extreme distress and
               suffering; nor had he as yet come by a physician that was able,
               though many had essayed, to cure him, but had rather grown worse
               under their hands; wherefore in despair he was minded no more to
               have recourse to any for counsel or aid. Whereat the damsel was
               overjoyed, deeming not only that she might find therein lawful occasion
               to go to <span class="place">Paris</span>, but, that, if the disease was what she took it to be,
               it might well betide that she should be wedded to Bertrand. So--for
               not a little knowledge had she gotten from her father--she prepared
               a powder from certain herbs serviceable in the treatment of the supposed
               disease, and straightway took horse, and hied her to <span class="place">Paris</span>.
               Arrived there she made it her first concern to have sight of Bertrand;
               and then, having obtained access to the King, she besought
               him of his grace to shew her his disease. The King knew not how
               to refuse so young, fair and winsome a damsel, and let her see the
               place. Whereupon, no longer doubting that she should cure him, she
               said: Sire, so please you, I hope in God to cure you of this malady
               within eight days without causing you the least distress or discomfort.
               The King inly scoffed at her words, saying to himself:
               How should a damsel have come by a knowledge and skill that
               the greatest physicians in the world do not possess? He therefore
               graciously acknowledged her good intention, and answered
               that he had resolved no more to follow advice of physician.
               Sire, said the damsel, you disdain my art, because I am young
               and a woman; but I bid you bear in mind that I rely not on
               my own skill, but on the help of God, and the skill of Master
               Gerard of Narbonne, my father, and a famous physician in his day.
               
               Whereupon the King said to himself: Perchance she is sent me by
               God; why put I not her skill to the proof, seeing that she says that
               she can cure me in a short time, and cause me no distress? And
               being minded to make the experiment, he said: Damsel, and if,
               having caused me to cancel my resolve, you should fail to cure me,
               what are you content should ensue? 
               Sire, answered the damsel,
               set a guard upon me; and if within eight days I cure you not, have
               me burned; but if I cure you, what shall be my guerdon? 
               You
               seem, said the King, to be yet unmarried; if you shall effect the
               cure, we will marry you well and in high place. 
               Sire, returned
               the damsel, well content indeed am I that you should marry me,
               so it be to such a husband as I shall ask of you, save that I may not
               ask any of your sons or any other member of the royal house.
               Whereto the King forthwith consented, and the damsel, thereupon
               applying her treatment, restored him to health before the period
               assigned. Wherefore, as soon as the King knew that he was cured:
               Damsel, said he, well have you won your husband. 
               She
               answered: In that case, Sire, I have won Bertrand de Roussillon,
               of whom, while yet a child, I was enamoured, and whom I have
               ever since most ardently loved. 
               To give her Bertrand seemed to
               the King no small matter; but, having pledged his word, he would
               not break it: so he sent for Bertrand, and said to him: Bertrand,
               you are now come to man's estate, and fully equipped to enter on it;
               'tis therefore our will that you go back and assume the governance
               of your county, and that you take with you a damsel, whom we have
               given you to wife. 
               And who is the damsel, Sire? said Bertrand.
               She it is, answered the King, that has restored us to health by
               her physic. 
               Now Bertrand, knowing Gillette, and that her lineage
               was not such as matched his nobility, albeit, seeing her, he had found
               her very fair, was overcome with disdain, and answered: So, Sire,
               you would fain give me a she-doctor to wife. Now God forbid that
               I should ever marry any such woman. 
               Then, said the King,
               you would have us fail of the faith which we pledged to the damsel,
               who asked you in marriage by way of guerdon for our restoration to
               health. 
               Sire, said Bertrand, you may take from me all that
               I possess, and give me as your man to whomsoever you may be
               minded; but rest assured that I shall never be satisfied with such a
               match. 
               Nay, but you will, replied the King; for the damsel
               is fair and discreet, and loves you well; wherefore we anticipate that
               you will live far more happily with her than with a dame of much
               higher lineage. 
               Bertrand was silent; and the King made great
               preparations for the celebration of the nuptials. The appointed day
               came, and Bertrand, albeit reluctantly, nevertheless complied, and in
               the presence of the King was wedded to the damsel, who loved him
               more dearly than herself. Which done, Bertrand, who had already
               taken his resolution, said that he was minded to go down to his
               county, there to consummate the marriage; and so, having craved and
               had leave of absence of the King, he took horse, but instead of
               returning to his county he hied him to <span class="place">Tuscany</span>; where, finding the
               Florentines at war with the Sienese, he determined to take service
               with the Florentines, and being made heartily and honourably welcome,
               was appointed to the command of part of their forces, at a
               liberal stipend, and so remained in their service for a long while.
               Distressed by this turn of fortune, and hoping by her wise management
               to bring Bertrand back to his county, the bride hied her
               to <span class="place">Roussillon</span>, where she was received by all the tenants as their
               liege lady. She found that, during the long absence of the lord,
               everything had fallen into decay and disorder; which, being a capable
               woman, she rectified with great and sedulous care, to the great joy of
               the tenants, who held her in great esteem and love, and severely
               censured the Count, that he was not satisfied with her. When the
               lady had duly ordered all things in the county, she despatched two
               knights to the Count with the intelligence, praying him, that, if 'twas
               on her account that he came not home, he would so inform her; in
               which case she would gratify him by departing. To whom with all
               harshness he replied: She may even please herself in the matter.
               For my part I will go home and live with her, when she has this ring
               on her finger and a son gotten of me upon her arm. 
               The ring was
               one which he greatly prized, and never removed from his finger, by
               reason of a virtue which he had been given to understand that it
               possessed. The knights appreciated the harshness of a condition
               which contained two articles, both of which were all but impossible;
               and, seeing that by no words of theirs could they alter his resolve,
               they returned to the lady, and delivered his message. Sorely distressed,
               the lady after long pondering determined to try how and
               where the two conditions might be satisfied, that so her husband
               might be hers again. Having formed her plan, she assembled certain
               of the more considerable and notable men of the county, to whom
               she gave a consecutive and most touching narrative of all that she
               had done for love of the Count, with the result; concluding by
               saying that she was not minded to tarry there to the Count's perpetual
               exile, but to pass the rest of her days in pilgrimages and pious
               works for the good of her soul: wherefore she prayed them to undertake
               the defence and governance of the county, and to inform the
               Count that she had made entire and absolute cession of it to him,
               and was gone away with the intention of never more returning to
               <span class="place">Roussillon</span>. As she spoke, tears not a few coursed down the cheeks
               of the honest men, and again and again they besought her to change
               her mind, and stay. All in vain, however; she commended them
               to God, and, accompanied only by one of her male cousins and a
               chambermaid (all three habited as pilgrims and amply provided with
               money and precious jewels), she took the road, nor tarried until she
               was arrived at <span class="place">Florence</span>. There she lodged in a little inn kept by a
               good woman that was a widow, bearing herself lowly as a poor
               pilgrim, and eagerly expectant of news of her lord.
            </p>
            <p>Now it so befell that the very next day she saw Bertrand pass
               in front of the inn on horseback at the head of his company; and
               though she knew him very well, nevertheless she asked the good
               woman of the inn who he was. The hostess replied: 'Tis a
               foreign gentleman--Count Bertrand they call him--a very pleasant
               gentleman, and courteous, and much beloved in this city; and he is
               in the last degree enamoured of one of our neighbours here, who is a
               gentlewoman, but in poor circumstances. A very virtuous damsel
               she is too, and, being as yet unmarried by reason of her poverty, she
               lives with her mother, who is an excellent and most discreet lady,
               but for whom, perchance, she would before now have yielded and
               gratified the Count's desire. 
               No word of this was lost on the lady;
               she pondered and meditated every detail with the closest attention,
               and having laid it all to heart, took her resolution: she ascertained
               the names and abode of the lady and her daughter that the Count
               loved, and hied her one day privily, wearing her pilgrim's weeds, to
               their house, where she found the lady and her daughter in very
               evident poverty, and after greeting them, told the lady that, if it
               were agreeable to her, she would speak with her. The gentlewoman
               rose and signified her willingness to listen to what she had to say;
               so they went into a room by themselves and sate down, and then
               the Countess began thus: Madam, methinks you are, as I am,
               under Fortune's frown; but perchance you have it in your power,
               if you are so minded, to afford solace to both of us. 
               The lady
               answered that, so she might honourably find it, solace indeed was
               what she craved most of all things in the world. Whereupon the
               Countess continued: I must first be assured of your faith, wherein
               if I confide and am deceived, the interests of both of us will suffer.
               Have no fear, said the gentlewoman, speak your whole mind
               without reserve, for you will find that there is no deceit in me.
               So the Countess told who she was, and the whole course of her love
               affair, from its commencement to that hour, on such wise that the
               gentlewoman, believing her story the more readily that she had
               already heard it in part from others, was touched with compassion
               for her. The narrative of her woes complete, the Countess added:
               Now that you have heard my misfortunes, you know the two
               conditions that I must fulfil, if I would come by my husband; nor
               know I any other person than you, that may enable me to fulfil
               them; but so you may, if this which I hear is true, to wit, that
               my husband is in the last degree enamoured of your daughter.
               Madam, replied the gentlewoman, I know not if the Count
               loves my daughter, but true it is that he makes great shew of loving
               her; but how may this enable me to do aught for you in the matter
               that you have at heart? 
               The how, madam, returned the
               Countess, I will shortly explain to you; but you shall first hear
               what I intend shall ensue, if you serve me. Your daughter, I see, is
               fair and of marriageable age, and, by what I have learned and may
               well understand, 'tis because you have not the wherewith to marry
               her that you keep her at home. Now, in recompense of the service
               that you shall do me, I mean to provide her forthwith from my own
               moneys with such a dowry as you yourself shall deem adequate for
               her marriage. 
               The lady was too needy not to be gratified by the
               proposal; but, nevertheless, with the true spirit of the gentlewoman,
               she answered: Nay but, madam, tell me that which I may do
               for you, and if it shall be such as I may honourably do, gladly will I
               do it, and then you shall do as you may be minded. 
               Said then the
               Countess: I require of you, that through some one in whom you
               trust you send word to the Count, my husband, that your daughter
               is ready to yield herself entirely to his will, so she may be sure that
               he loves her even as he professes; whereof she will never be convinced,
               until he send her the ring which he wears on his finger, and
               which, she understands, he prizes so much: which, being sent, you
               shall give to me, and shall then send him word that your daughter
               is ready to do his pleasure, and, having brought him hither secretly,
               you shall contrive that I lie by his side instead of your daughter.
               Perchance, by God's grace I shall conceive, and so, having his ring
               on my finger, and a son gotten of him on my arm, shall have him
               for my own again, and live with him even as a wife should live with
               her husband, and owe it all to you.
            </p>
            <p>The lady felt that 'twas not a little that the Countess craved of her,
               for she feared lest it should bring reproach upon her daughter: but
               she reflected that to aid the good lady to recover her husband was
               an honourable enterprise, and that in undertaking it she would be
               subserving a like end; and so, trusting in the good and virtuous
               disposition of the Countess, she not only promised to do as she was
               required, but in no long time, proceeding with caution and secrecy,
               as she had been bidden, she both had the ring from the Count, loath
               though he was to part with it, and cunningly contrived that the
               Countess should lie with him in place of her daughter. In which
               first commingling, so ardently sought by the Count, it so pleased
               God that the lady was gotten, as in due time her delivery made
               manifest, with two sons. Nor once only, but many times did the
               lady gratify the Countess with the embraces of her husband, using
               such secrecy that no word thereof ever got wind, the Count all the
               while supposing that he lay, not with his wife, but with her that he
               loved, and being wont to give her, as he left her in the morning,
               some fair and rare jewel, which she jealously guarded.
            </p>
            <p>When she perceived that she was with child, the Countess, being
               minded no more to burden the lady with such service, said to her:
               Madam, thanks be to God and to you, I now have that which I
               desired, and therefore 'tis time that I make you grateful requital, and
               take my leave of you. 
               The lady answered that she was glad if the
               Countess had gotten aught that gave her joy; but that 'twas not as
               hoping to have guerdon thereof that she had done her part, but
               simply because she deemed it meet and her duty so to do. 
               Well
               said, madam, returned the Countess, and in like manner that
               which you shall ask of me I shall not give you by way of guerdon,
               but because I deem it meet and my duty to give it. 
               Whereupon
               the lady, yielding to necessity, and abashed beyond measure, asked of
               her a hundred pounds wherewith to marry her daughter. The
               Countess, marking her embarrassment, and the modesty of her
               request, gave her five hundred pounds besides jewels fair and rare,
               worth, perhaps, no less; and having thus much more than contented
               her, and received her superabundant thanks, she took leave of her and
               returned to the inn. The lady, to render purposeless further visits or
               messages on Bertrand's part, withdrew with her daughter to the
               house of her kinsfolk in the country; nor was it long before Bertrand,
               on the urgent entreaty of his vassals and intelligence of the departure
               of his wife, quitted <span class="place">Florence</span> and returned home. Greatly elated by
               this intelligence, the Countess tarried awhile in <span class="place">Florence</span>, and was
               there delivered of two sons as like as possible to their father, whom
               she nurtured with sedulous care. But by and by she saw fit to take
               the road, and being come, unrecognized by any, to <span class="place">Montpellier</span>,
               rested there a few days; and being on the alert for news of the
               Count and where he was, she learned that on All Saints' day he
               was to hold a great reception of ladies and gentlemen at <span class="place">Roussillon</span>.
               Whither, retaining her now wonted pilgrim's weeds, she hied her,
               and finding that the ladies and gentlemen were all gathered in the
               Count's palace and on the point of going to table, she tarried not to
               change her dress, but went up into the hall, bearing her little ones in
               her arms, and threading her way through the through to the place
               where she saw the Count stand, she threw herself at his feet, and
               sobbing, said to him: 
               My lord, thy hapless bride am I, who to
               ensure thy homecoming and abidance in peace have long time been
               a wanderer, and now demand of thee observance of the condition
               whereof word was brought me by the two knights whom I sent to
               thee. Lo in my arms not one son only but twain, gotten of thee,
               and on my finger thy ring. 'Tis time, then, that I be received of
               thee as thy wife according to thy word. 
               Whereat the Count was
               all dumfounded, recognizing the ring and his own lineaments in the
               children, so like were they to him; but saying to himself nevertheless:
               How can it have come about? 
               So the Countess, while the
               Count and all that were present marvelled exceedingly, told what
               had happened, and the manner of it, in precise detail. Wherefore
               the Count, perceiving that she spoke truth, and having regard to her
               perseverance and address and her two fine boys, and the wishes of
               all his vassals and the ladies, who with one accord besought him to
               own and honour her thenceforth as his lawful bride, laid aside his
               harsh obduracy, and raised the Countess to her feet, and embraced
               and kissed her, and acknowledged her for his lawful wife, and the
               children for his own. Then, having caused her to be rearrayed in
               garments befitting her rank, he, to the boundless delight of as many
               as were there, and of all other his vassals, gave up that day and some
               that followed to feasting and merrymaking; and did ever thenceforth
               honour, love and most tenderly cherish her as his bride and wife.

            <p>But--to come to
               my story--I say that in the city of <span class="place">Capsa</span>Now Gafsa, in <span class="place">Tunis</span>.
               in Barbary there was once
               a very rich man, who with other children had a fair and dainty little
               daughter, <span class="person">Alibech</span> by name. Now <span class="person">Alibech</span>, not being a Christian,
               and hearing many Christians, that were in the city, speak much in
               praise of the Christian Faith and the service of God, did one day
               inquire of one of them after what fashion it were possible to serve
               God with as few impediments as might be, and was informed that
               they served God best who most completely renounced the world and
               its affairs, like those who had fixed their abode in the wilds of the
               <span class="place">Thebaid</span> desert. Whereupon, actuated by no sober predilection, but
               by childish impulse, the girl, who was very simple and about fourteen
               years of age, said never a word more of the matter, but stole away
               on the morrow, and quite alone set out to walk to the <span class="place">Thebaid</span>
               desert; and, by force of resolution, albeit with no small suffering, she
               after some days reached those wilds; where, espying a cabin a great
               way off, she hied her thither, and found a holy man by the door,
               who, marvelling to see her there, asked her what she came there to
               seek. She answered that, guided by the spirit of God, she was come
               thither, seeking, if haply she might serve Him, and also find some one
               that might teach her how He ought to be served. Marking her
               youth and great beauty, the worthy man, fearing lest, if he suffered
               her to remain with him, he should be ensnared by the Devil, commended
               her good intention, set before her a frugal repast of roots of
               herbs, crab-apples and dates, with a little water to wash them down,
               and said to her: My daughter, there is a holy man not far from
               here, who is much better able to teach thee that of which thou art in
               quest than I am; go to him, therefore; and he shewed her the
               way. But when she was come whither she was directed, she met
               with the same answer as before, and so, setting forth again, she came
               at length to the cell of a young hermit, a worthy man and very
               devout--his name Rustico--whom she interrogated as she had the
               others. Rustico, being minded to make severe trial of his constancy,
               did not send her away, as the others had done, but kept her with
               him in his cell, and when night came, made her a little bed of palmleaves;
               whereon he bade her compose herself to sleep. Hardly had
               she done so before the solicitations of the flesh joined battle with the
               powers of Rustico's spirit, and he, finding himself left in the lurch
               by the latter, endured not many assaults before he beat a retreat, and
               surrendered at discretion: wherefore he bade adieu to holy meditation
               and prayer and discipline, and fell a musing on the youth and beauty
               of his companion, and also how he might so order his conversation
               with her, that without seeming to her to be a libertine he might yet
               compass that which he craved of her. So, probing her by certain
               questions, he discovered that she was as yet entirely without cognizance
               of man, and as simple as she seemed: wherefore he excogitated
               a plan for bringing her to pleasure him under colour of serving God.
               He began by giving her a long lecture on the great enmity that
               subsists between God and the Devil; after which he gave her to
               understand that, God having condemned the Devil to hell, to put
               him there was of all services the most acceptable to God. The girl
               asking him how it might be done, Rustico answered: Thou
               shalt know it in a trice; thou hast but to do that which thou seest me
               do. Then, having divested himself of his scanty clothing, he threw
               himself stark naked on his knees, as if he would pray; whereby he
               caused the girl, who followed his example, to confront him in the
               same posture.No apology is needed for leaving, in accordance
               with precedent, the
               subsequent detail untranslated.

            <p>E cos√¨ stando, essendo Rustico pi√π che mai nel suo
               disid√©ro acceso per lo vederla cos√¨ bella, venne la
               resurrezion della
               carne, la quale riguardando <span class="person">Alibech</span> e maravigliatasi, disse:
               Rustico, quella che cosa √®, che io ti veggio, che cos√¨ si
               pigne in
               fuori, e non l' ho io? 
               O figliuola mia, disse Rustico, questo
               √®
               il Diavolo, di che io t' ho parlato: e vedi tu? ora egli mi d√†
               grandissima
               molestia, tanta che io appena la posso sofferire. 
               Allora disse la
               giovane: Oh lodato sia Iddio, ch√® io veggio che io sto meglio
               che non stai tu, ch√® io non ho cotesto Diavolo io. 
               Disse Rustico:
               Tu di' vero, ma tu hai un' altra cosa che non la ho io, et
               h√°ila in iscambio di questo. 
               Disse <span class="person">Alibech</span>: O che? 
               A cui
               Rustico disse: Hai il ninferno; e dicoti che io mi credo che
               Iddio t' abbia qui mandata per la salute della anima mia, per ci√≤
               che se questo Diavolo pur mi dar√† questa noja, ove tu vogli aver di
               me tanta piet√†, e sofferire che io in inferno il rimetta, tu mi darai
               grandissima consolazione, et a Dio farai grandissimo piacere e
               servigio, se tu per quello fare in queste parti venuta se', che tu di'.
               La giovane di buona fede rispose: O padre mio, poscia che ho
               il ninferno, sia pure quando vi piacer√†. 
               Disse allora Rustico:
               Figliuola mia, benedetta sia tu; andiamo dunque, e rimetti√°mlovi
               s√¨ che egli poscia mi lasci stare. 
               E cos√¨ detto, menata la
               giovane sopra uno de' loro letticelli, le 'nsegn√≤ come star si dovesse a
               dovere
               incarcerare quel maledetto da Dio. La giovane, che mai pi√π non
               aveva in inferno messo diavolo alcuno, per la prima volta sent√¨ un
               poco di noja, per che ella disse a Rustico: Per certo, padre mio,
               mala cosa dee essere questo Diavolo, e veramente nimico di Dio, ch√®
               ancora al ninferno, non che altrui, duole quando egli v' √® dentro
               rimesso. 
               Disse Rustico: Figliuola, egli non avverr√† sempre
               cos√¨.
               
               E per fare che questo non avvenisse, da sei volte, anzi che di su il
               letticel si movessero, ve 'l rimisero, tanto che per quella volta gli
               trasser s√¨ la superbia del capo, che egli si stette volentieri in
               pace. 
               Ma, ritornatagli poi nel seguente tempo pi√π volte, e la giovane
               ubbidiente
               sempre a trargliele si disponesse, avvenne che il giuoco le cominci√≤
               a piacere, e cominci√≤ a dire a Rustico: Ben veggio che il ver
               dicevano que' valentuomini in <span class="place">Capsa</span>, che il servire a Dio era cos√¨
               dolce cosa: e per certo io non mi ricordo che mai alcuna altra ne
               facessi, che di tanto diletto e piacer mi fosse, quanto √® il
               rimettere il
               Diavolo in inferno; e per ci√≤ io giudico ogn' altra persona, che ad
               altro che a servire a Dio attende, essere una bestia. 
               Per la qual
               cosa essa spesse volte andava a Rustico, e gli dicea: Padre mio,
               io son qui venuta per servire a Dio e non per istare oziosa; andiamo
               a rimettere il Diavolo in inferno. La qual cosa faccendo, diceva
               ella alcuna volta: Rustico, io non so perch√® il Diavolo si fugga
               di
               ninferno; ch√® s' egli vi stesse cos√¨ volentieri come il
               ninferno il
               riceve e tiene, egli non se ne uscirebbe mai. 
               Cos√¨ adunque
               invitando
               spesso la giovane Rustico, et al servigio di Dio confortandolo s√¨ la
               bambagia del farsetto tratta gli avea, che egli a tal ora sentiva freddo
               che un altro sarebbe sudato; e per ci√≤ egli incominci√≤ a dire
               alla
               giovane che il Diavolo non era da gastigare n√® da rimettere in
               inferno,
               se non quando egli per superbia levasse il capo; e noi per grazia di
               Dio l'abbiamo s√¨ sgannato, che egli priega Iddio di starsi in
               pace: e
               cos√¨ alquanto impose di silenzio alla giovane. 
               La qual, poi che vide
               Rustico non la richiedeva a dovere il Diavolo rimettere in inferno,
               gli disse un giorno: Rustico, se il Diavolo tuo √® gastigato e
               pi√π non ti d√† noja, me il mio ninferno non lascia stare: per
               che
               tu farai bene che tu col tuo Diavolo ajuti attutare la rabbia al
               mio ninferno, com' io col mio ninferno ho ajutato a trarre la
               superbia al tuo Diavolo. 
               Rustico, che di radici d' erba e d' acqua
               vivea, poteva male rispondere alle poste; e dissele che troppi diavoli
               vorrebbono essere a potere il ninferno attutare, ma che egli ne
               farebbe ci√≤ che per lui si potesse; c cos√¨ alcuna volta le
               sodisfaceva,
               ma s√¨ era di rado che altro non era che gittare una fava in bocca al
               leone: di che la giovane, non parendole tanto servire a Dio quanto
               voleva, mormorava anzi che no. 
               However, the case standing thus
               (deficiency of power against superfluity of desire) between Rustico's
               Devil and <span class="person">Alibech</span>'s hell, it chanced that a fire broke out in <span class="place">Capsa</span>,
               whereby the house of <span class="person">Alibech</span>'s father was burned, and he and all
               his sons and the rest of his household perished; so that <span class="person">Alibech</span> was
               left sole heiress of all his estate. And a young gallant, <span class="person">Neerbale</span> by
               name, who by reckless munificence had wasted all his substance,
               having discovered that she was alive, addressed himself to the pursuit
               of her, and, having found her in time to prevent the confiscation of
               her father's estate as an escheat for failure of heirs, took her, much to
               Rustico's relief and against her own will, back to <span class="place">Capsa</span>, and made
               her his wife, and shared with her her vast patrimony. But before
               he had lain with her, she was questioned by the ladies of the manner
               in which she had served God in the desert; whereto she answered,
               that she had been wont to serve Him by putting the Devil in hell,
               and that <span class="person">Neerbale</span> had committed a great sin, when he took her out
               of such service. The ladies being curious to know how the Devil
               was put in hell, the girl satisfied them, partly by words, partly by
               signs. Whereat they laughed exorbitantly (and still laugh) and said
               to her: Be not down-hearted, daughter; 'tis done here too;
               <span class="person">Neerbale</span> will know well how to serve God with you in that way.
               And so the story passing from mouth to mouth throughout the city,
               it came at last to be a common proverb, that the most acceptable
               service that can be rendered to God is to put the Devil in hell;
               which proverb, having travelled hither across the sea, is still current.
               Wherefore, young ladies, you that have need of the grace of God,
               see to it that you learn how to put the Devil in hell, because 'tis
               mightily pleasing to God, and of great solace to both the parties,
               and much good may thereby be engendered and ensue.

            <h3 class="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
            <p>A thousand times or more had <span class="person">Dioneo</span>'s story brought the laugh to
               the lips of the honourable ladies, so quaint and curiously entertaining
               found they the fashion of it. And now at its close the queen, seeing the
               term of her sovereignty come, took the laurel wreath from her head,
               and with mien most debonair, set it on the brow of <span class="person">Filostrato</span>,
               saying: We shall soon see whether the wolf will know better
               how to guide the sheep than the sheep have yet succeeded in guiding
               the wolves. 
               Whereat <span class="person">Filostrato</span> said with a laugh: Had I been
               hearkened to, the wolves would have taught the sheep to put the
               Devil in hell even as Rustico taught <span class="person">Alibech</span>. Wherefore call us not
               wolves, seeing that you have not shewn yourselves sheep: however,
               as best I may be able, I will govern the kingdom committed to my
               charge. 
               Whereupon <span class="person">Neifile</span> took him up: Hark ye, <span class="person">Filostrato</span>,
               she said, while you thought to teach us, you might have learnt a
               lesson from us, as did Masetto da <span class="place">Lamporecchio</span> from the nuns, and
               have recovered your speech when the bones had learned to whistle
               without a master.I.e. when you were so emaciated that your
               bones made music like a skeleton in the wind.
               <span class="person">Filostrato</span>, perceiving that there was a scythe
               for each of his arrows, gave up jesting, and addressed himself to the
               governance of his kingdom. He called the seneschal, and held him
               strictly to account in every particular; he then judiciously ordered
               all matters as he deemed would be best and most to the satisfaction of
               the company, while his sovereignty should last; and having so done,
               he turned to the ladies, and said: 
               Loving ladies, as my ill luck
               would have it, since I have had wit to tell good from evil, the charms
               of one or other of you have kept me ever a slave to Love: and for
               all I shewed myself humble and obedient and conformable, so far as
               I knew how, to all his ways, my fate has been still the same, to be
               discarded for another, and go ever from bad to worse; and so, I
               suppose, 'twill be with me to the hour of my death. Wherefore I am
               minded that to-morrow our discourse be of no other topic than that
               	which is most germane to my condition, to wit, of those whose loves
               had a disastrous close: because mine, I expect, will in the long
               run be most disastrous; nor for other cause was the name, by which
               you address me, given me by one that well knew its signification.
               Which said, he arose, and dismissed them all until supper-time.
            </p>
            <p>So fair and delightsome was the garden that none saw fit to quit
               it, and seek diversion elsewhere. Rather--for the sun now shone
               with a tempered radiance that caused no discomfort--some of the
               ladies gave chase to the kids and conies and other creatures that
               haunted it, and, scampering to and fro among them as they sate,
               had caused them a hundred times, or so, some slight embarrassment.
               <span class="person">Dioneo</span> and <span class="person">Fiammetta</span> fell a singing of Messer Guglielmo
               and the lady of Vergi√π.Evidently some version of the tragical
               conte de la
               Chastelaine de
               Vergi, qui mori por laialment amer son ami. See Fabliaux et
               Contes,

               Journ√©e vii. Nouvelle lxx.
               <span class="person">Filomena</span> and Pamfilo sat them down to
               a game of chess and, as thus they pursued each their several
               diversions, time sped so swiftly that the supper-hour stole upon them
               almost unawares: whereupon they ranged the tables round the
               beautiful fountain, and supped with all glad and festal cheer.
            </p>
            <p>When the tables were removed, <span class="person">Filostrato</span>, being minded to
               follow in the footsteps of his fair predecessors in sway, bade <span class="person">Lauretta</span>
               lead a dance and sing a song. She answered: My lord, songs of
               others know I none, nor does my memory furnish me with any of
               mine own that seems meet for so gay a company; but, if you will
               be content with what I have, gladly will I give you thereof.
               Nought of thine, returned the king, could be other than
               goodly and delectable. Wherefore give us even what thou hast. 
               So
               encouraged, <span class="person">Lauretta</span>, with dulcet voice, but manner somewhat
               languishing, raised the ensuing strain, to which the other ladies
               responded:

               	Would I had died, or e'er
               	Sounded those notes of joy
               	(Ah! dolorous cheer!) my woe to celebrate!
               So list my supplication, lover dear,
               	Of whom such joyance I,
               	As ne'er another, had. Thou that in clear
               	Light of the Maker's presence art, deny
               	Not pity to thy fere,
               	Who thee may ne'er forget; but let one sigh
               	Breathe tidings that on high
               	Thou burnest still for me;
               	And sue of God that He me there translate.

            <p>So ended <span class="person">Lauretta</span> her song, to which all hearkened attentively,
               though not all interpreted it alike. Some were inclined to give it a
               moral after the <span class="place">Milan</span>ese fashion, to wit, that a good porker was
               better than pretty quean. Others construed it in a higher, better
               and truer sense, which 'tis not to the present purpose to unfold.
               Some more songs followed by command of the king, who caused
               torches not a few to be lighted and ranged about the flowery mead;
               and so the night was prolonged until the last star that had risen had
               begun to set. Then, bethinking him that 'twas time for slumber,
               the king bade all good-night, and dismissed them to their several
               chambers.
