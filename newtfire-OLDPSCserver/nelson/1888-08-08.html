                  <p>For dismal surroundings, economy of comforts, and heartless treatment, to the <span class="exposComp BostonStore">Boston store</span> belongs the palm.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>I did not work in that establishment although I tried very hard to do so. I was in
                     the store at 8 o'clock on Friday morning as arranged with Mr. Hillman, who had partially promised to hire me. <span class="employer"><q class="dialogue">One of the girls in the hosiery department</q></span> he had said <span class="employer"><q class="dialogue">is sick, and if she doesn't come back Friday morning I will try you.</q></span></p>
                  
                  <p>I could not find the gentleman, although I hunted the main floor and the floors above
                     and below. My plan of fluctuation was to take the elevator up one story and walk down, then ride up two and walk down
                     the third flight, in that way I took in the entire store and a great part of the <span title="Spelling retained from original article: employees">employes</span>. I began at the bottom and spent a full hour in the basement, where I saw so much
                     and suffered so much that the upper floors had no surprises for me. In the first place
                     the atmosphere was almost unendurable.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>Hot! It must have been 100 degrees above!</p>
                  
                  <p>Out in the open air not a breeze was stirring and the heat was sizzling. Down where
                     I was I could not see a single opening to admit the air, fiery as it was, excepting
                     the open door at the extreme southeast corner of the floor, leading up a short flight of steps to the sidewalk. About this
                     doorway so many goods were piled and draped and hung that the passage of air was obstructed.
                     There must have been forty, and there may been eighty, clerks, cash boys, and girls on this floor and five times that number
                     of customers surged in and out under the glaring rays of gas-jets and electric burners.
                     Babies squirmed and cried under the suffocating heat; children screamed and fretted;
                     men and women fanned and wiped their faces, but the little cash-girls and the languid clerks endured their prison uncomplaining. Add to the heat from gas-jets, electric lights, and machinery, the exhalations from
                     so many people, the moldy smell from the damaged goods, the dampness of the freshly
                     mopped floor, the fumes from a stray disinfectant, and the mildew and earthy odor
                     that lurked in dark corners, and you have some idea of the quarters in which customers
                     are invited to look for bargains and where helpless, honest, freeborn American men
                     and women, boys and girls are forced to work for clothes and bread.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>What about the soul? It's mockery to mention it to these slaves in such a dungeon.</p>
                  
                  <p>On a rude plank door painted black is the work <q class="double">Ladies.</q> The irony of it! <q class="double">Serfs</q> would be less impertinent and <q class="double">bond-women</q> or <q class="double">drudges</q> better than either.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>The door yields to my touch and I enter the toilet and cloak room. The atmosphere is so intense and the effluvia
                     so offensive that I am almost stifled. A window about eighteen inches square has been
                     cut in the side of the staircase leading from the street, and here I stand, my face turned up to the clouds of dust that float in from the feet and skirts of the passing
                     customers. By and by I get accustomed to the foulness and turn round to explore the place. The
                     floor is black and wet from recent mopping; the janitor has swept all the previous
                     day's rubbish in from the basement and it forms a big pile behind the door. There
                     is only one gas-jet in the room and I do not see the wet sweepings until I have stepped
                     in them. On either side of the inclosure are the cloak-boxes, communication to which
                     is afforded by a window a foot square. A young and very pretty colored woman is in
                     one section and in the opposite window is a little boy possibly 13 years old. All the female help pass their hats, wraps, and lunches through these windows, and they are put in a cubby-hole the number of which corresponds
                     to the number of the clerk. The smell of mold forcibly assails the senses, and mingled with the foul odor from
                     the adjoining closets the effect on the lunches must be left to the imagination. On
                     the east side of the partition is the toilet inclosure, built like the rest, under
                     the pavement. But for the perforated coal-hole covers overhead the place would be
                     pitch dark. It is damp, dirty, and smelly, the stone sidewalk forming the ceiling
                     and gray flagstones the floor. The closets, four or five in number, have not even
                     the luxury of doors, and in a space at one end is a dirty little iron sink into which
                     runs a stream of water. As only two girls can approach the narrow trough for water
                     at a time it is not hard for the reader to understand how great a luxury this single
                     stream of clear, cool water is to the slave-girls. At one time I counted twenty-eight
                     girls in this filthy little hole, which is unfit for cattle and in which no man would
                     water a faithful dog.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>When I had accustomed myself to the deadly smell that pervaded the place it was 9:30
                     o'clock and the girls were beginning to come in to wash their hands and clean up after arranging their stock. About the little mirror were seven girls, some combing their hair, some dressing it, and all trying to get a peep at their wan faces. The closets were crowded, and while three young girls were washing at the sink five
                     moved about with bits of soap in their hands, their arms and faces covered with lather. The soap may have been furnished by the house, but of the absence
                     of towels I am positive. Most of the girls had their own comb, soap, and towel, and where do you suppose they carried them?
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>In the bosom of their dresses.</p>
                  
                  <p>I cautioned a girl who had opened the front of her waist against putting the we towel so near her breast, but she only laughed and said <span class="workingGirl"><q class="dialogue">nothin'll hurt me.</q></span></p>
                  
                  <p><span class="nellNelson"><q class="dialogue">But it is wet and may cause a lung trouble.</q></span></p>
                  
                  <p><span class="workingGirl"><q class="dialogue">Indeed it won't. I used to put it here all last winter and it didn't hurt me. When
                           it was awful cold I wore it home and I never even had a cold.</q></span> As she spoke she folded the little towel, and laying it against her under-waist buttoned her dress and went to the hole in the north cloak-box for a glass of lemonade. I told her I
                     was very thirsty and asked for a drink.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p><span class="workingGirl"><q class="dialogue">Oh, you have to pay. It's 3 cents a glass.</q></span></p>
                  
                  <p>The colored girl and her little white slave had a bucket full of the beverage—a very excellent article, by the way—which they
                     retailed at the price stated. The ebony vender refused to sell to me till I convinced
                     her that I expected to begin in the hosiery stock as soon as Mr. Hillman came down. The girl with the wet damask in her bosom drained her glass to the last drop, ate the slices of lemon rind and pulp, and with the help of her finger transferred every gram of undissolved sugar to her mouth. She lapped the mouth of the glass with her tongue and when the boy took it from the ledge it was as dry as could be. I could not get
                     her to confide her salary, but she said: <span class="workingGirl"><q class="dialogue">It ain't nothing like $5. For two years I only got $3, but now I have more.</q></span></p>
                  
                  <p>I found a girl named Bessie in the closetroom lying against the wall, the very picture of death. Her face had no more color in it than a china cup, her lips were blue, dark lines increased the brilliancy of her big blue eyes, and her hands were cold and clammy. She told me she was <q class="double">aweful sick,</q> but her mother made her come because she didn't want her to lose her place.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p><span class="workingGirl"><q class="dialogue">The floor walker 'ud leave me go home if I ast him, but I haven't any car-fare and
                           I don't want to walk. I lost my tea money and all comin down in the cars this morning.
                           I was asleep.</q></span> I offered to pay her car-fare.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p><span class="workingGirl"><q class="dialogue">No; if I ride in the air I'll be better before I get to the bridge.</q></span></p>
                  
                  <p>I bought her a glass of lemonade and gave her <q class="double">tea pennies</q> for a week, after which we became quite confidential.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p><span class="workingGirl"><q class="dialogue">I get $2 a week here and give it to my mother to buy meat. Sometimes I ride home, but them's the days that I don't buy tea, 'cause it costs
                           too much for both. The tea is 3 cents a cup and the car fare, if you ride both ways,
                           is 10 cents, and that's 13 cents.</q></span></p>
                  
                  <p>Seventy-eight cents subtracted from $2 would leave a precious small sum for meat.</p>
                  
                  <p><span class="workingGirl"><q class="dialogue">The most I ever spent is 50 cents a week. That's how much mother let's me keep out.
                           Oh, they're kind of good to us. Last night when it rained Mr. Hillman gave nickels to the cash-girls that didn't have car fare nor gossamers. But I guess
                           he'll keep it out of their wages payday. Some of the clerks don't be good to us. They pull us everywhere and push us when
                           we don't go fast, and we never dast ride in the elevator. The clerks can, but the cash-girls has to walk. They don't fine us if we come late,
                           though, and they do the clerks, some 15 cents and some 25 cents, and if any of us
                           is sick we lose the whole day out of our wages. The one I like most is Miss Gannon; she is awful good; she puts three lumps in the tea, and trusts the girls when they
                           haven't any tea pennies.</q></span></p>
                  
                  <p>A larger girl, possibly <span class="unclear" title="The text provided here was interpreted by a project editor because the transcription source was unclear.">13</span>, showed me her odd shoes. <span class="workingGirl"><q class="dialogue">I'm wearing this one with the tipes to break it in. I have to stand all day and my feet are so sore I can hardly bear a new shoe. I got these new ones in June. Oh, they'll
                           las till Christmas I guess. My salary is $5 a week, but I don't save anything. My mother takes it all for the groceries. I don't know what I'm going to do. Clerking is very
                           hard but I can't sew or I'd go and work in a neck-tie factory where girls get $10.
                           Do housework? No, I wouldn't like to live <span class="unclear" title="The text provided here was interpreted by a project editor because the transcription source was unclear.">out</span>. I can't cook, anyway. I could mind the children, but nurse girls only earn $12 a
                           month. Yes, I know they have their board. No, not their washing. If you don't help the kitchen girls whenever they tell you you have to do your own washing, and I'd rather than have them bossing me.</q></span></p>
                  
                  <p>A mite of a cash girl who wore broken slippers said she had better shoes at home,
                     but it was so hard running all day that she couldn't wear them.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>One of a cluster of girls from the grocery floor who were earning $3 and $3.50 a week
                     said: <span class="workingGirl"><q class="dialogue">People talk bad about the <span class="exposComp BostonStore">Boston store</span>, but it's as good as any of them. We needn't be at the store till 8 in the morning,
                           and they never fine us if we're late. Lots of times when I've been sick the floor-walker
                           has told me to go out and walk round, and if I didn't feel better when I came back
                           he would let me go home. If it rains Mr. Netcher lends us car-fare. He never said to pay him back, but I always did. We get <q class="single">p. ms.</q> too, and las week I made 80 cents extra. At noon we can take 40 minutes and go where
                           we like. We girls always go to <span class="org"><span class="CaS">Cooper &amp; Siegel's</span></span>, and eat in the basement. At the Fair they give you a dinner for 25 cents, and whenever we have a lot of <q class="single">p. ms.</q> we eat there.</q></span></p>
                  
                  <p><span class="nellNelson"><q class="dialogue">Why don't you eat up-stairs in the lunch room?</q></span> I asked.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p><span class="workingGirl"><q class="dialogue">Well, 'cause the benches haven't any backs, and <span title="Spelling retained from original article: it's">its</span> nicer to go out for a change.</q></span></p>
                  
                  <p>Like <q class="double">the wards of Jarndyce,</q> caged up in this place of abomination that the heavenly compassion of the proprietors
                     have provided for their hapless <q class="double">ladies,</q> I met hope, youth, squalor, want, disease, despair, woe, cunning, innocence, rags,
                     beauty, bravery, and industry variously personified in all stages of miserable girlhood
                     and womanhood. Much of the talk I heard was coarse, indictive of ignorance and low
                     breeding, but I saw no evidence of depravity or viciousness. One hears a great deal
                     about the purchase of the shop-girl, but the insinuations are as false as they are
                     base. The skeptic has only to look at the garb to admit their virtue. <span class="unclear" title="The text provided here was interpreted by a project editor because the transcription source was unclear.">Vice</span> is better dressed. I spent an hour or more on the main floor watching the swarming
                     customers joggle one-another and haggle with the young girls who waited on them. So
                     many people in the densely-stocked, over-crowded, ill-vertilated room polluted the
                     atmosphere, making the strong weak and the weak sick. Every available foot of space
                     was utilized, some of the counters consisting of common pine b<span class="unclear" title="The text provided here was interpreted by a project editor because the transcription source was unclear.">ow</span>s on the side of which emaciated children in<span class="unclear" title="The text is unclear and could not be transcribed."> [MISSING TEXT] </span>ured fringes, trimmings, ribbons, and cheap <span class="unclear" title="The text is unclear and could not be transcribed."> [MISSING TEXT] </span>. One of these <q class="single">troughs,</q> filled with Hamburg edging, was placed between the two elevators, and the little
                     girls in charge were knocked and pushed about by the hurrying crowd in a most unseemly
                     manner. I did not see any girl sitting down nor any provision for a momentary rest. <span class="unclear" title="The text provided here was interpreted by a project editor because the transcription source was unclear.">There</span> was no mistaking the poverty of the <span class="unclear" title="The text is unclear and could not be transcribed."> [MISSING TEXT] </span> in which these hapless young creatures <span class="unclear" title="The text is unclear and could not be transcribed."> [MISSING TEXT] </span> for their garments were old and shabby and in many cases unclean, unkempt, and <span class="unclear" title="The text provided here was interpreted by a project editor because the transcription source was unclear.">unsoliable</span>. Worse than their clothes was the unkempt <span class="unclear" title="The text provided here was interpreted by a project editor because the transcription source was unclear.">condition</span> of the hair and person of some young girls. As in the adjoining establishment I saw
                     girls waiting on customers in their stocking feet. I saw the floor-walkers push and drag the young girls about and the managers <span class="unclear" title="The text provided here was interpreted by a project editor because the transcription source was unclear.">bully</span> and drive both. One of these dignitaries, a tall, argus-eyed blonde with bent shoulders
                     and a drooping head was the right man in the right place. Everybody <span class="unclear" title="The text provided here was interpreted by a project editor because the transcription source was unclear.">dispersed</span> at his coming. His scowl was something <span class="unclear" title="The text provided here was interpreted by a project editor because the transcription source was unclear.">torturing</span>, and had I been a subordinate and given the choice of the lash and one of his glances of <span class="unclear" title="The text is unclear and could not be transcribed."> [MISSING TEXT] </span> I should have taken the former. There was another head, a tall, compactly-built brunette, almost as formidable, who
                     had a pair of eyes that seemed to burn holes in everything and everybody contemplated.

                  <p>The same sweltering crowd harassed the clerks on the second, third, and fourth floors,
                     and on the fifth the sight of so many little <span class="unclear" title="The text provided here was interpreted by a project editor because the transcription source was unclear.">dredges selling</span> groceries or handling goods made <span class="unclear" title="The text provided here was interpreted by a project editor because the transcription source was unclear.">one</span> feel ashamed of the civilization that <span class="unclear" title="The text provided here was interpreted by a project editor because the transcription source was unclear.">fostered such</span> a condition of woman. The youngest girls in many instances wore big check aprons
                     to screen rather than save the worthless little dresses beneath. It was harrowing
                     to see these children, boys of 10 and 12 and fragile girls of 11, 12, 13, and 14,
                     carrying boxes of soap, starch, and candles, packages of buckwheat, salt, and hominy,
                     and cans filled with oils, <span title="Spelling retained from original article: syrups">sirups</span>, vinegars, and the like. The men in charge had no hesitancy in <span class="unclear" title="The text provided here was interpreted by a project editor because the transcription source was unclear.">demanding</span> these transfers, calling Maggie and Mary as often as John or Dick to make the <span class="unclear" title="The text is unclear and could not be transcribed."> [MISSING TEXT] </span>. I saw one little boy of slight build with a sweet but very sad face dragging a bag
                     of coffee that would have been a strain on the muscles of a strong man, and a little
                     Swede girl who said she was 13 in March hhad a box full of canned vegetables in her arms, the the weight of which made her <span class="unclear" title="The text provided here was interpreted by a project editor because the transcription source was unclear.">blush</span> in the face.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>There is a ruin of youth and beauty which is more appalling than age, and into such
                     ruin has the youthful grace, vigorous beauty, and the charm of <span class="unclear" title="The text provided here was interpreted by a project editor because the transcription source was unclear.">gladness</span> and trust of these <span class="unclear" title="The text provided here was interpreted by a project editor because the transcription source was unclear.">immature</span> lives fallen.

                  </p>
                  
                  <p>A bridge of sighs spans the alley on the fifth floor bringing the two stores of <span class="unclear" title="The text provided here was interpreted by a project editor because the transcription source was unclear.">Messes C.</span> W. &amp; E. Pardridge into communication. Across this covered passage in the <span class="org"><span class="Pardridge">Pardridge store</span></span> proper is a small room in the rear of the floor which is used as a cafe by the female
                     help of the <span class="exposComp BostonStore">Boston store</span>. The furnature consists of two narrow tables and three long benches extending the length
                     of the apartment. The benches have no rung or rest for the back and here the young
                     women and check-girls sit at noon over their lunch. On the wall is an expansive sheet of ecru paper bearing this inscription:
                  </p>
                  
                  <p><q class="double">Female clerks and check-girls: You are requested not to eat on the stairs or anywhere

                        be discharged.</q></p>
                  
                  <p>Apropos of signs I forgot to say that in the basement where the cloak-room is designated
                     this notice appeared in bold relief:
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>The girl who took the silk umbrella Saturday is known. If it is not returned at once
                     she will have to take the consequences.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>Another less conspicuously placed sign read:</p>
                  
                  <p>All female <span title="Spelling retained from original article: employees">employes</span> will be ready for work at 7:45 a. m., under penalty.

                  <p>Miss Gannon, who has charge of the kitchen is the good angel of the place. She is a plump, nice-looking
                     person of splendid presence, with mild eyes, a firm face, sweet voice, and a heart
                     brimful of motherly tenderness. She makes tea and lemonade which, with fresh milk,
                     is retailed at 3 cents a glass. The tea has cream in it and the three lumps of sugar
                     that go with each cup are a gastronomical treat to the little ones, who drink the
                     Japan first and save the sugar cubes for dessert.

                  <p>When I found Mr. Hillman he called his assistant, the <span class="unclear" title="The text provided here was interpreted by a project editor because the transcription source was unclear.">glowering</span> brunette with the <span class="unclear" title="The text provided here was interpreted by a project editor because the transcription source was unclear.">fiery</span> eyes, who told me he had no opening<span class="unclear" title="The text provided here was interpreted by a project editor because the transcription source was unclear.">—</span>told it, too, with a degree of positiveness that left no room for argument. With this summary dismissal after waiting nearly two hours I rode up to the top floor
                     to see if I could not find an opening in the grocery store. Mr. Silver was hung up in a side gallery midway between the ceiling and floor with a dozen or
                     more perspiring clerks. It did not take me long to discover that I was being pursued,
                     for I had not been engaged two minutes with the head of the mailing department, a
                     most arbitrary, red-haired, narrow-chested creature of <span class="unclear" title="The text is unclear and could not be transcribed."> [MISSING TEXT] </span>, before <span class="unclear" title="The text provided here was interpreted by a project editor because the transcription source was unclear.">Messrs.</span> Hillman and <span class="unclear" title="The text provided here was interpreted by a project editor because the transcription source was unclear.">Netcher</span> sent him word to appear at once.
