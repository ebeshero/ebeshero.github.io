                  <p>Judge O. H. Horton of the circuit court was on the point of starting for a fortnight's outing, with
                     fishing accompaniment, at <span class="place">Alexandria</span>, <span class="place">Minn.</span>, when informed that <span class="chicTimes">THE TIMES</span> would like to have his views on the working-girl question.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p><span class="promMan"><q class="dialogue">I shall never forget</q></span>, he began, <span class="promMan"><q class="dialogue">a remark made by Horatio Seymour in a memorable speech he made in Baltimore. Referring
                           to house servants he said that while they were exposed to the greatest temptations
                           almost invariably they had shown themselves to be honest. In most households where
                           the services of a domestic are required there are always valuables in the form of
                           jewelry, plate, or clothing that an inmate of the household could easily appropriate.
                           Frequently the help are left in charge of the house during the vacation months, and
                           yet it is a rare thing for a trusted house girl to take advantage of her opportunities to defraud. In my experience on the bench I do not remember to have had but one servant girl before me charged with theft,
                           and I had to force the tears back from my eyes when she told her story. She said she was a married woman and had a young baby. Her husband had deserted her, stolen the child, and gone to St. Paul. She frankly admitted that she had stolen the jewelry and pawned it to secure money
                           to follow her husband and recover her child. I managed to uphold the majesty of the law and at the same time did not interfere
                           with her search for her child.</q></span></p>
                  
                  <p><span class="promMan"><q class="dialogue">But I suppose <span class="chicTimes">THE TIMES</span> has special reference to female labor in shops and factories. As to child labor,
                           it is hard to say in a general way what should be done. As lawyers say: <q class="single">Hard cases make bad precedents.</q> Suppose a widow with no income has children from 12 to 15 years of age who could
                           earn from $2 to $3 a week each. Should she be absolutely prohibited from utilizing their labor, when she would otherwise be forced to beg or starve? It is difficult to make a rule
                           for all cases. Beyond question, children ought to be prohibited from doing any kind
                           of labor, and in any places where the natural tendency is deleterious to health or
                           morals; and, in addition, children ought to be educated. There shoudl be a sort of
                           semi-compulsory system of education, something having a certain degree of elaasticity,
                           which, when wisely enforced, would benefit the masses and at the same time relieve
                           the few. I could make myself clearly understood if I had more time. As to the effect
                           of immigration on home labor, and especially female labor, that is a big problem.
                           I have often wondered why the various labor organizations have not taken means to
                           protect themselves against what are known as the <q class="single">assisted</q> classes—paupers and criminals—coming to our shores to demoralize labor. And, by the way, these labor organizations, by whatever name they may be called,
                           have just as good a right to exist <span class="unclear" title="The text provided here was interpreted by a project editor because the transcription source was unclear.">as have</span> the railroad <span class="unclear" title="The text provided here was interpreted by a project editor because the transcription source was unclear.">pools</span>. The trouble is existence is not as easy for them. It is not a difficult matter for ten or a dozen railroad magnates to meet in a private
                           office and take action that shall affect the commercial interests of the entire continent,
                           and stick together to carry out their scheme, but it is next to impossible to hold a hundred thousand working men to the accomplishment
                           of a certain object. I favor a tariff for the protection of American labor; capital
                           can take care of itself. I have a strong leaning toward and a warm feeling for the
                           working classes. I know what their life is, as I once shoved lumber over a vessel's side right here in <span class="place">Chicago</span>.</q></span></p>
                  
                  <p><span class="promMan"><q class="dialogue">It is not an easy task to say what legislation can or should do, and I confess my inabilidty to devise a plan. This question of female and child labor, like many other social quesitons, I do
                           not know how to compass except by educating the people to a higher standard. I see
                           no sense in passing laws that can have no effect on the object aimed at, and are merely
                           for buncombe, to help elect some fellow to the legislature. In fact, as regards all
                           semi-moral questions, there is absolutely no use in passing aggressive laws any faster
                           than the people are educated up to them. They will be of no earthly use. I am tempted
                           to refer to prohibition legislation in this connection, but will not run off on that
                           now.</q></span></p>
                  
                  <p><span class="promMan"><q class="dialogue">You ask me <q class="single">what I know about girls.</q> In the present state of society nearly every girl who goes out to service, in home,
                           shop, or factory, looks upon her employment as temporary, pending marriage, whereas a young man regards his employment as a lifework. The house girl has this great incentive. She expects to continue in the same line, and for herself; while the others are almost
                           invariably looking forward to housekeeping as a finality, but in most instances without
                           having received any training to qualify them for its responsibilities. All this has to do with the wages of women. There are many social matters, seemingly
                           of minor importance, that have much to do with this question of equality of wages.
                           For instance, we will take a young man and a young woman who are employed in the same
                           factory, and who are doing the same kind and the same amount of skilled work. Suppose
                           they are good friends, with a possibility og becoming something more. If they ride
                           home on the street-car together the man, of course, pays for both. If they go to the
                           theater he buys the tickets, and in case of emergency hires a carriage. Ice-cream,
                           or other expected and more costly delicacies, increase expenses. Now who has the advantage?
                           The woman would get rich while the man was pauperizing himself. Our social system puts burdens on young men that it does not place on young women, and on the whole
                           the system needs readjustment. As an abstract proposition is must be admitted that in any kind of labor there should
                           be no distinction made as to whether it was performed by male or female, old or young,
                           but the existing social state of affairs has, as I have said, demands on the young
                           men that it does not have on the young women—demands that we are compelled to recognize as though they were statutory. This social
                           compact must yield the one if it demands the other. I am speaking, of course, from
                           a financial standpoint.</q></span></p>
                  
                  <p><span class="promMan"><q class="dialogue"><span class="unclear" title="The text is unclear and could not be transcribed."> [MISSING TEXT] </span> personal experience with <span class="unclear" title="The text is unclear and could not be transcribed."> [MISSING TEXT] </span> go outside of any household. I have never employed a female clerk in my law office. There I want someone to whom I can say <q class="double">go,</q> when business presses, and I could scarcely bring myself to the point of saying that
                           to a female when I wanted immediate communication with a client or with the court.
                           There is much of that feeling in the American mind. It is the same sentiment that moves men to surrender their seats to ladies in a crowded street car. The question of immigration I have not time to discuss further that to say that I
                           am trying to learn, in my everyday language, to make a distinction between <q class="single">foreigners</q> and <q class="single">aliens.</q> We are all foreigners, at least by decent. The Indians are the only natives.</q></span></p>
                  
                  <p>Judge Horton hurriedly expressed his detestation of aliens, as distinguished from foreigners who come to this country to become a
                     part of it. Continuing, he said:
                  </p>
                  
                  <p><span class="promMan"><q class="dialogue">I believe in education as the eventual remedy for the evils complained of. The work
                           can not be accomplished in a day, or in a generation. I would like to see <q class="single">waifs<span class="unclear" title="The text provided here was interpreted by a project editor because the transcription source was unclear.">'</span> homes</q> established all over the city where boys and girls are cared for and trained. And right here I want to say that I have been sorry, on this account, to see aspersions
                           east upon C. B. Holmes that might injure his usefulness in this work. Up on <span class="place">Ciybourn avenue</span> he has the largest mission school in the <span class="place">United States</span>, conducts it himself from the platform without the aid of teachers, and my own observation has satisfied me that he has done an immense amount of good. If I were asked whether, in my opinion, wages are proportionate to the profits of employers in manufacturing industries, I should have to answer, <q class="single">I don't know.</q> It would seem to me, however, that in some cases they are. It is a partnership between
                           money and muscle, and they ought to divide. If I should form a partnership with a
                           skilled mechanic, he to furnish the skill and do the work and I to furnish the capital,
                           he would be entitled to half the profits. And so with the manufacturer. His <span title="Spelling retained from original article: employees">employes</span> should share in his profits. But suppose he has 1,000. He is then 1,000 and each individual <span title="Spelling retained from original article: employee">employe</span> is but 1,000th. Capital and labor are as necessary to each other as is <span class="place">Chicago</span> to her railroads. Neither could exist without the other and they should work together. A good many
                           years ago Judge Arington was a well-known character in <span class="place">Chicago</span>. On certain occasions he gave himself up to writing poetry, some specimens of which
                           now exist in book form. I have in my possession, in manuscript, one of his productions in which, speaking of the parsons and <q class="single">Old Nick</q> or the devil, he says they are</q></span></p>
                  
                  <p><span class="promMan"><q class="dialogue">As necessary to each other</q></span></p>

                  <p>Judge Horton spoke hurriedly, but with a readiness indicating that he had given the
                     subject much thought.
