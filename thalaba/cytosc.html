         <h2>A Guide for XML Coders for Using Cytoscape</h2>  
            <h4>under construction</h4>
            <p>Cytoscape is widely used in the biological sciences to study the complex networks of information exchange among protein molecules, for example. Its applications in biology and chemistry has encouraged optimization of Cytoscape's network graphics, allowing for considerable fine-tuning: including the ability to weight and draw many kinds of edges, and to generate many different graphical organizations based on network statistics. With its Network Analyzer tool, it is especially helpful for studying multiple kinds of network statistics and this makes it especially effective for scholars in any field to study their data by plotting it according to various measures of centrality (betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, Eigenvector centrality) as well as to plot according to network path lengths to arrange one's data in terms of network measures of "closeness" and "distance." Because Cytoscape offers so many options to visualize network data, it offers a good way to learn and study network statistics as well as to export network graphs optimized for legibility: One can produce labelled SVG, PNG, or JPG images for export and use in slides, all from within Cytoscape's interface. For those interested in making dynamic network plots available for web view, there is a Cytoscape Javascript Library, which does not offer the same array of graphs (not as many graphs optimized for reading the full range of network statistics supported in th software version). </p>
            <p>Most users of Cytoscape work with flat, simple hierarchical databases of information, and import graph data from spreadsheets or simple tables with columns and rows. We who code in XML with its deep nesting apply our markup to generate usually a more complicated kind of database in the branching of our tree structures. We need to prepare our data for view in Cytoscape by performing an extraction of the data we wish to plot from our markup. Since network graphs can plot any kind of relationship involving a shared context of some kind, XML markup may be ideally suited for network plotting, since nested structures provide a basis for understanding shared contexts that form the edges in a network plot.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Consider, first of all, what phenomena in your text you want to network together as your nodes, and what produces a connection between them as your edges. In a social network analysis, that might involve a study of all the individuals in a text who are shown in conversation with each other at a given moment (or structural unit) of your text. In my “anti-social” network plot of <i>Thalaba</i>, I am studying how the places named and marked in my TEI text are networked together inside line-groups, whether in the lines of poetry or in prose annotations marked within the line-group. So my <strong>nodes</strong> are the places in the line-groups, and my <strong>edges</strong> are determined by the unit line-group, because position in a line-group marks a shared space or context for linkage.</li>
        <li><h4>Preparing Data to Import: </h4> Different network analysis tools (Gephi, Pajek, Cytoscape) require different ways to import data. (This is why, I think, most people tend to use a specific network analysis software package, or work within "R" which produces its own network plots). While Pajek (for example) requires its import data in two columns (nodes followed by edges), Cytoscape requires data to be imported in <strong>three main columns: Node Edge Node</strong>. That is, you need to output a list of nodes, connecting points, and the node to which each is connected as a table of data. You are also able to import, <strong>in a second stage</strong>, information about your nodes and edges. In Cytoscape, information that describes qualities of particular nodes or edges is known as <strong>attribute data</strong>, and we can have <strong>node attributes</strong> and <strong>edge attributes</strong>. We can write XSLT or XQuery to output text arrayed in columns with a separator, knowing that we can import data in tab-separated or commma-separated columns. I prepare a single table containing my node data, node attribute data, edge data, edge attribute data, and connected node data and connected attribute data.
            <p>Here is a sampling of my data from the <i>Thalaba</i> project, isolating the node Yemen at Book 4 line-group 218:</p>
           <p> Yemen	place	note	B4_lg218	Earth_planet	place</p>
            <p>Yemen	place	note	B4_lg218	the planet Venus	metaplace</p>
            <p>Yemen	place	note	B4_lg218	Bagdad	place</p>
            <p>Yemen	place	note	B4_lg218	Yemen	place</p>
            <p>Yemen	place	note	B4_lg218	Mecca	place</p>
            <p>Yemen	place	note	B4_lg218	Mecca	place</p>
            <p>Yemen	place	note	B4_lg218	Bombay	place</p>
            <p>Yemen	place	note	B4_lg218	Heaven	metaplace</p>
            
    <p>All of these lines indicate a single node, Yemen, and a set of edges pointing to other places and metaplaces mentioned in the same line-group with Yemen. You need a separate line to indicate each connection. (Generating this tab-separated text output is ideally suited for "pull" XSLT using xsl:for-each, or better yet, XQuery.) [here I will post a link to sample XSLT and XQuery here from my project.]
