                    <p>Networks are structures of linkages and interactions, and in studying them we attempt to organize relationships, considering how close or how distant particular points are from each other, or how centrally important something, or someone is to a collective. If we can plot a readable model of a network, we can make it possible to locate individual points that are highly important, and isolate areas that are vulnerable to influence. Plotting network models might help to predict the spread of a virus, or a breakdown in overloaded circuitry, or it might help to identify the most influential individuals in a royal court over two generations. In this tutorial, we'll focus on humanities applications for network analysis with an emphasis on <strong>networks of co-occurence</strong> (networks of things that appear together in the same shared contexts):</p>
                       <ul><li><em>A fairly typical application of network analysis in humanities:</em> Which people are mentioned together the most frequently in a series of letters?</li>
                       <li><em>A somewhat less typical application of networks:</em> In a heavily footnoted epic poem that references a very wide range of geographic and mythological locations very frequently, which places are mentioned within each line group and its appended footnoes? Do the references to places in stanzas of the poem and its footnotes form a coherent network that can tell us something interesting about how a poet imagined comparative relationships between places around the world at the time the poem was written?</li> </ul>
                    <p>In thinking about how to address these questions with network analysis tools, it will help, first and foremost, to understand what network analysis is designed to do, and how it can be applied in meaningful and not-so-meaningful ways based on the way we define the relationships that form a network.</p>
                    
                    <img src="nodeEdgenode.png" alt="simple network graph"/><span class="smaller">Source: mathinsight.org: <a href="http://mathinsight.org/network_introduction">An introduction to networks</a>.</span>         
                    <p>In a network graph, particles (or "nodes") are plotted in a distinctly defined relationship ("edge," "bridge," "link," or "path") with respect to other nodes. Formalizing these relationships is a long history of mathematical theory, called "graph theory," dating back to the efforts of Leonhard Euler in 1736 to find a solution to a challenge posed by the seven bridges in the Prussian city of Königsberg:</p>
                    <img src="KonigsBridges.jpg" alt="Seven Bridges of Königsberg"/>
                    
      <p>The city had seven bridges crossing four landmasses (two islands in a river, and two areas on opposite banks). The question was, could a person walk through all parts of the city using all the bridges, but crossing each bridge <em>only once</em> during the walk? (No fair walking halfway onto a bridge and turning around, and then walking the other half at a later point: a pedestrian was to completely cross each bridge during the walk.) Could it be done without crossing any bridge twice?</p> 
                    <p>Euler drew a diagram to simplify and study the problem: He converted each landmass to a point (or "vertex," or "node"), and turned the bridges into lines ("edges" or "paths"). In studying the problem he came up with mathematical theory known as the "Eulerian path" or "Eulerian walk," which asserted conditions necessary for a networked system to be traversed by moving along each path only once. </p>

                    <span class="smaller">Source (both images): <a href="http://www.allmathwords.org/en/t/topology.html">All Math Words Encyclopedia</a></span>
                    <p>The seven bridges of Königsberg did not meet the conditions for a Eulerian walk, because for such a walk to exist, either all the nodes must have an even number of edges branching from them, or only two nodes may have have an odd number of edges. In the mathematical language of network analysis, the number of edges leading from a node determines its <strong>"degree"</strong>, and in this case each of the nodes (or landmasses of Königsberg) has an odd numbered degree (Node C has a degree of 5, while nodes A, B, and D have degrees of 3). Euler proved the walk was impossible for the seven bridges of Königsberg, but in so doing he began establishing the diagrams and calculations associated with <strong>"graph theory"</strong> or <strong>"network analysis theory"</strong> as we know it today, so that we can speak consistently across many fields about <strong>nodes</strong>, <strong>degrees</strong>, and <strong>walks</strong> in traversing a network.</p>
                  
                    <p>I have introduced networks with Euler's "Seven Bridges of Königsberg" problem because it helps to to demonstrate that network graphs are essentially diagrams designed to help visualize a set of relationships in an abstract, simplified way. The networks we produce should make it possible for us to read a set of relationships <strong>more easily</strong> than we could otherwise, and they need to be based on very clearly defined relationships, as concretely definable as the connectors of the parts of Königsberg. Before networks are plotted in graphs we should be able to read them as a set of tabulated data There are multiple ways to visualize this data, but the foundation is a set of relationships and some question(s) that you raise about them. It's most important from the outset to be very clear in your definition of <strong>what is connected to what</strong>, so that your network is meaningful and measurable. This can be difficult when we are grappling with more abstract questions than the Seven Bridges problem. In the contexts of Digital Humanities projects, we can readily imagine highly elaborate networks defined by a multiple different kinds of relationships, such as, for example, the relationships among letter writers in a correspondence network in defining "strong or weak" ties between individuals: Does it matter how frequently people wrote back to each other to measure the strengths of people's relationships, or does a single exchange matter as much as an exchange of hundreds of memos, perhaps weighted more on one side than other? (Notice that this question of who's writing to whom is much more complicated than the co-occurence questions we're going to investigate here: which people and which places are mentioned together in a shared context of a letter or of a stanza in a poem?)  Rarely are the edges of a network graph in humanities research as simple as a concrete bridge, and we often face questions of how many different kinds of relationships we want to try to picture at once when we try to model our networks! Would it make sense for us to try to network characters in the epic poem together with its references to places? Could we link people to each other based on their shared associations with a) particular geographic places and b) a particular stanza in a poem? Even though network analysis tools would let you construct networks however you please based on your import of node and edge data, I would advise plotting these as separate networks: people with geographic places vs. people with stanzas, so that we do not confuse multiple kinds of relationships together.  </p>  
                   </li><li> <h3 id="pitfall">Network Analysis Pitfalls for Digital Humanities: Keep it Simple!</h3>   
                       <p><a href="http://www.scottbot.net/HIAL/?p=6279">Scott Weingart describes some of the problems that ensue when Digital Humanists attempt to graph overly complex networks</a>: In his blog, he shows us first a network made of authors and books: <a href="http://www.scottbot.net/HIAL/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/NetBooksAuthorsEdges.png">a broken network</a> showing four authors, with edges connecting them to texts they have authored. This is called a <strong>"bimodal network"</strong> because it networks two different kinds of nodes (people and books). What if we wanted to connect this network on another dimension by indicating which authors influenced or collaborated with each other? <a href="http://www.scottbot.net/HIAL/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Full-Network.png">The diagram can be drawn</a>, but we need to realize that the edges in the graph now mean <strong>two different kinds of relationships which are inconsistent with each other</strong>. One set of edges is <strong>"directed"</strong> (because an author directly creates a book, but books do not create their authors. However, the other set should be understood as <strong>"undirected"</strong> because collaboration and influence are not easily marked in terms of a clear originator and recipient of action. The difference might be understood to be grammatical.  "Directed" and "undirected" are important terms in network theory, and since directed edges involve a clear directional relationship they are usually drawn with arrows indicating the initiator and recipient. Undirected edges are understood to be symmetrical or bi-directional (so they usually are simplified as a single line without arrow points). The edges in <a href="http://www.scottbot.net/HIAL/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Full-Network.png">this graph</a> might be colored or drawn differently, but the problem is in the plotting of the network as a graph representing relationships: As Weingart points out, the algorithms underlying network analysis plots in the software we use are not equipped to simultaneously handle a graph that is both directed AND undirected at the same time, and we are generally prompted to choose one form or the other. Digital Humanists plotting their first network graphs who proceed without fully understanding the difference between these two kinds of edge might simply choose one or the other just to produce a plot, and they might organize their plot based on degrees and measurements of centrality that literally do not make sense, though they produce a dazzling visualization! My warning in this tutorial is simple: Don't try to mix multiple kinds of relationships in a network graph. <strong>Visualize networks based on simple, unambiguous relationships.</strong> Who initiated contact with whom and in what places is a more complicated question than who shows up together in the same place with whom. If your data is consistently marked to indicate initiators and receivers of some shared property (like kinship or friendship), plotting a directed network would make sense, but you don't want to mix directed and undirected relationships on the same graph. Though we can use network analysis software to attempt to graph complex and dazzling images of networks, we need to be aware that a) the network analysis is not the graph but the data underlying it, and b) the plot may be asserting relationships in a way that is not really accurate.</p>
                       
                       <p>Think about the relationships you want to network in the form of a sentence: <strong>Subject (Node 1) <span class="code">Verb (Edge)</span> Direct Object.</strong> Node 1 <span class="code">is tied ____in some specific way____</span> to other nodes. </p>
                        
                       <p>Once we are clear about <strong>a particular kind of relationship</strong> we are studying, we can apply network analysis to study properties associated with networks. For example, how many connections are there between points X and Y? How much information is exchanged between these two centers of activity? How many different ways can you reach point D from point A without going through Point B? Which node is most influential on the majority of nodes around it? Which nodes are necessary to hold a network together? How many isolated clusters (or "cliques") do I have in my data, and do I have multiple ("broken") networks or a single unified network? The real power of network analysis is in addressing questions like these: the pictures and plots you produce should help you to study relationships in a meaningful way. Rarely, if ever, can you let these visuals speak for themselves, even as you fine-tune visual properties. You will likely want to apply color differences and thickness of lines and size of nodes, even different label sizes to express particularly meaningful properties, and you will need to define these clearly to make your graphs sharable and legible with readers, even those familiar with your data. Without context, the pixels make a lovely blur, but on their own are they an abstract art form?</p>

                    </li><li><h3 id="xmlNet">Why XML Encoding Can be Great for Network Analysis</h3>
                        <p>Most people who work on network analyses are probably not XML coders, since most network analysis tutorials presume that one's data is plugged into rows and columns on a spreadsheet or is already prepared in a simple plain text form. For most who apply network visualization tools, the "database" means a grid form. However, those of us who code in XML create an alternative form of a database, with "XML nodes" defined in terms of elements, which are organized steps moving through hierarchies of varying depths. The topography of an XML database is typically uneven and need not be flat to those of us who traverse it with XPath. Since network graphs can plot any kind of relationship involving a shared context of some kind, XML markup may be ideally suited for network plotting, since nested structures provide a basis for understanding shared contexts that form the edges in a network plot. XML text encoding in Digital Humanities projects often involves a combination of structural markup (of chapters, pages, paragraphs, line-groups, lines, etc.), contextual markup, and analytical markup (identifying linguistic features, motifs, proper names, dates, locations, etc). The combinations of our markup can be studied as networks of relationships, and a particularly easy one to plot from XML markup is a <strong>network of co-occurence</strong>, which plots where nodes occur together in particular contexts: Which proper names appear together (or "co-occur") most frequently in particular structural contexts, such as the unit stanza?</p><p>While network analysis may not be the right tool for every digital humanities job, for coders of XML there may actually be many distinctly interesting ways to plot data from the same related set of files, a very rich field of opportunity. What you will need to do is extract data into a tabular form that defines the nodes and edges on a network graph. Reach into your nested XML data, and extract it in a plain text tabular (.tsv or .csv) file that looks like everyone else's data imports. And perhaps you can go back and extract more data, with different nodes and edges.) A great reason to try plotting a network from XML structure might just be because you have a hunch that you might learn something interesting based on relationships you're beginning to see in your markup. Even if the plot is difficult to read at first, you can easily filter it if you can locate particular areas of interest within your plot, and in the process if you are using a powerful network analyzing tool like Cytoscape, you will learn about concepts in network theory, statistics of centrality, closeness, and distance by plotting your data according to network calculations built into the software program. I learned much about network statistics, and at the same time, Robert Southey's references to places in <i>Thalaba the Destroyer</i> by working with Cytoscape to see what I could see!</p>

            <h3 id="whyCyt">Why Try Cytoscape?</h3>
                    <p>Of the open-source network analysis tools available to digital humanists, including <a href="http://gephi.github.io/features/">Gephi</a> and <a href="http://hdlab.stanford.edu/projects/palladio/">Palladio</a>, Cytoscape may not seem an obvious choice for beginners to the field, though much may be gained and quickly learned by those willing to explore and customize its many options. <a href="http://cytoscape.org/">Cytoscape</a> is widely used in the biological sciences to analyze complex exchanges of information at the molecular level, and its applications in biology and chemistry have encouraged optimization of Cytoscape’s network graphics, allowing for considerable fine-tuning helpful for projects in many fields. Within the software program, users have a potentially bewildering but impressively diverse range of options for weighting and styling edges, sizing and coloring nodes, fine-tuning the organization of a network graph and filtering it to produce many discreet views is highly optimized and dynamic within the Cytoscape software program. Though some of that fine-tuning may be lost in the effort to export graphs to the web, the Cytoscape programmers as well as independent web developers have been working to produce javascript-based exports of the dynamic plots built in the software. (For those interested in making dynamic network plots available for web view, there is a Cytoscape Javascript Library, which does not offer the same array of graphs (not as many graphs optimized for reading the full range of network statistics supported in th software version). One can easily export labelled static SVG, PNG, or JPG images from Cytoscape’s interface for use in slides or web-based projects.</p><p>With its Network Analyzer tool, Cytoscape is especially helpful for applying many kinds of network statistics, and this makes it especially effective for scholars in any field to study their data by plotting it according to various measures of centrality (notably degree centrality, betweenness centrality, and closeness centrality) as well as to plot according to network path lengths to arrange one’s data in terms of network measures of “closeness” and "distance, all of which we'll discuss below as we work through our Cytoscape tutorial. For a brief and helpful introduction to the three most frequently discussed centrality measures, see <a href="http://www.orgnet.com/sna.html">Orgnet's "Social Network Analysis: A Brief Introduction"</a>. Because Cytoscape offers so many options to visualize network data, its plots are an especially good way to learn and study network statistics as well as to export network graphs optimized for legibility.</p>
            
            
            <p>Most users of Cytoscape work with flat, simple hierarchical databases of information, and import graph data from spreadsheets or simple tables with columns and rows. We who code in XML with its deep nesting apply our markup to generate usually a more complicated kind of database in the branching of our tree structures. We need to prepare our data for view in Cytoscape by performing an extraction of the data we wish to plot from our markup.</p>

                <li><h3 id="dataImport">How to Prepare Data for Import into Cytoscape (Version 3.2)</h3>
                    <p>Consider, first of all, what phenomena in your text you want to network together as your nodes, and what produces a connection between them as your edges. For what follows, I'm going to work with the data I used to prepare <a href="https://digitalromanticist.wordpress.com/2013/08/23/spectacular-intersections-of-place-in-southeys-thalaba-the-destroyer/">my network analysis of named places in the epic poem <i>Thalaba the Destroyer</i></a>, which I introduced earlier in this tutorial. In my network plot of <i>Thalaba</i>, I am studying how the places named and marked in my XML text are networked together inside line-groups, whether in the lines of poetry or in prose annotations marked within the line-group. So my <strong>nodes</strong> are the place names in the line-groups, and my <strong>edges</strong> are determined by the unit line-group, because position in a line-group marks a shared space or context for linkage. Each edge is designated as "main" or "note" depending on whether the shared relationship with other places occurs in the lines of poetry or in a footnote appended to a given group of lines (or stanza).</p>
                    <p>Different network analysis tools (Gephi, Pajek, Cytoscape) require different ways to import data. (This is why, I think, most people tend to use a specific network analysis software package, or work within “R” which produces its own network plots). For example, while Pajek requires its initial import data in two columns of nodes, Cytoscape requires data to be imported first in <strong>three main columns: Node Edge Node</strong>. That means that you’ll need to write a transformation in XQuery or XSLT to output in plain text a list of nodes, connecting points, and the node to which each is connected, with a separator of some kind. While Cytoscape (like other network software) accepts a range of import formats, the simplest and most reliable format I have found is a plain text file made of columns separated by tabs or commas, saved as .tsv (tab-separated format), or .csv (comma separated format). You could import this text into a spreadsheet program like Microsoft Excel, or any number of programs designed to recognize column layouts.</p>
                    <p>In Cytoscape, information that describes qualities of particular nodes or edges is known as <strong>attribute data</strong>, and we can have <strong>node attributes</strong> and <strong>edge attributes</strong>. Your first import to Cytoscape will <strong>only</strong> submit the node, edge, and node columns, plus a column identified as "edge attributes." You may import, <strong>in a second stage</strong>, the attribute information about your nodes. We can write XSLT or XQuery to output text arrayed in columns with a separator, knowing that we can import data in tab-separated or commma-separated columns. I prepare a <strong>single text file</strong> containing all of my node data, node attribute data, edge data, edge attribute data, and connected node data and connected attribute data, and I use that file twice: once to initiate the network, and again to add node attribute data.</p>
                    <p>Additional data might be specific information that describes your nodes and edges (known as "node attributes" and "edge attributes" in a network analysis context): In my Thalaba project, I differentiate between “place” and "metaplace" to distinguish two different kinds of place nodes which I then color-code in my output, so the values of "place" or "metaplace" are my node attribute data on any given place name. For my edges in the Thalaba project, I want particular information on which Book and line-group number forms a particular linkage, and this information is my "edge attribute data." I use XQuery to extract node names, edge data, as well as node attributes and edge attributes all together line-by-line with tab characters to separate the values, and use the resulting file to import to Cytoscape for network analysis.</p>
                    <p>To get an idea of how you'll need to extract your data, here is a sampling of my data from the <i>Thalaba</i> project, isolating the node "Yemen" at Book 4 line-group 218. In the first line of the table, I have applied <strong>bold</strong> to highlight the most important network information: the location of node 1, the edge value, and the location of node 2. The bold indicates the information that you identify in the first import. The other words here are "attribute data," information that modifies a node (node attribute data) or an edge (edge attribute data):</p>
                    
                    <p> <strong>Yemen</strong>	place	<strong>note</strong>	B4_lg218	<strong>Earth_planet</strong>	place</p>
                    <p>Yemen	place	note	B4_lg218	the planet Venus	metaplace</p>
                    <p>Yemen	place	note	B4_lg218	Bagdad	place</p>
                    <p>Yemen	place	note	B4_lg218	Yemen	place</p>
                    <p>Yemen	place	note	B4_lg218	Mecca	place</p>
                    <p>Yemen	place	note	B4_lg218	Mecca	place</p>
                    <p>Yemen	place	note	B4_lg218	Bombay	place</p>
                    <p>Yemen	place	note	B4_lg218	Heaven	metaplace</p>
                    
                    <p>All of these lines indicate <strong>a single node</strong>, Yemen, and a set of edges pointing to other places and metaplaces mentioned in the same line-group with Yemen. You need a separate line to indicate each connection. (Generating this tab-separated text output is ideally suited for “pull” XSLT using xsl:for-each, or better yet, XQuery set to output plain text.) 
                    </p>        
            <h4>When writing your XQuery or XSLT to extract data:</h4> 
                   <ul> 
                       <li>Write your data extraction code so that you produce plain text output, separated by a tab character, or by a comma and a white-space. (I recommend using a tab character in case your data contains commas in its nodes or edge data.) Use the special entity notation for a tab character: <span class="code">&amp;#x9;</span>.</li>
                    
                    <li>Output a text file that contains, line-by-line, a tab-separated set of values: <span class="code">node, node attribute, edge, edge attribute, connected-node, connected node-attribute.</span> Remember: You don't need all of these for your first import to Cytoscape, but you can re can reuse the same table to import data more than once.</li> 
                       <li>In XSLT, set your xsl:output statement (one of the required top-level elements in the xsl:stylesheet, usually found directly after the root node) to output text. Here's how to set it: <div class="code"><span class="code">&lt;xsl:output method="text"/&gt;</span> 
  
                       </div>
                       </li>
                       <li>In XSLT, work with <span class="code">xsl:for-each</span> to loop through each reference to a place and to output its connecting information and other nodes. Read about XSLT for "pull" scenarios (when you want to use it extract specific data as you are here rather than output an edition of a text). My favorite resource on this is <a href="http://dh.obdurodon.org/xslt-basics-2.xhtml">Obdurodon's XSLT tutorial: part 2</a>, or Michael Kay's book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/XSLT-2-0-XPath-Programmers-Reference/dp/0470192747">XSLT 2.0 and XPath 2.0, 4th Edition</a>.</li>
                       <li>In XQuery, write your output statement using string-join() and/or concat(), using the tab character <span class="code">&amp;#x9;</span> as your separator. You may need a new line character as well to be sure that lines are not run together in your output. Use a linefeed character: <span class="code">&amp;#10;</span> to generate a new line where you need it at the end of a string you've joined together.</li>
                       <li><strong>Do you need to "de-dupe" your node names?</strong> "De-dupe" means to de-duplicate or try to correct for spurious alternate spellings. In the course of extracting your data or in visualizing it, you may notice you need to work on this, perhaps by coding attribute values with a canonical spelling, or by keeping a central list of standard names and values to which each variant of a name refers. It's a common markup problem, and the process of data visualization can actually help you catch problems with this.</li>
                       <li>Save your output file with the extension <span class="code">.tsv</span> or <span class="code">.csv</span> (for tab-separated values, comma-separated values). You'll use this file to import your data into Cytoscape.</li>

            <p>First, do you have Cytoscape installed? The software is free and is available for all platforms from here: <a href="http://cytoscape.org/">http://cytoscape.org/</a>. The Cytoscape developers will indicate that you need a particular version of Java installed: check to be sure that you have it. This tutorial provides instruction using Cytoscape 3.2.1 (current as of March 2015), and my screen captures come from my installation for Windows 8.</p>
            <p>When you first launch Cytoscape, you will see the following screen inviting you to Start a New Session, and on it you should select "From Network File...". (If you accidentally close this, just go to the File menu and select Import→Network→File. </p>
            <img src="cytoscImport1.PNG" alt="launching Cytoscape"/>
        
        <p>Browse for your .tsv or .csv file and open it. You will see the following import screen:</p>
            <img src="cytoscImport2.PNG" alt="first import screen"/>
            <p>Click on "Show Text File Import Options" under "Advanced", and open the choose the appropriate delimiter (or the kind of characters you used to separate your values (tab, comma, space, etc.)</p>
        <img src="cytoscImport3.PNG" alt="text delimiter options"/>
            <p>If there have been no problems with your data extraction, your data should appear neatly arrayed in columns, which you can now select for your first immport. The first immport involves selecting the first Node column (as "Source Interaction"), the Edge column (as "Interaction Type", and the connected Node ("Target Interaction") columns. You can also designate one column in blue as Edge Attribute data. I leave the other columns (node attribute data) unselected for now. (I'll come back later and import node attribute data in a second import round--that's how Cytoscape handles this.) Here's how my screen looks when I've selected these first columns for import. (Note: I selected the columns for Node Edge node at the top of the screen, and then I clicked on Column 4 to turn it blue so it would be designated the Edge Attribute column.)</p>
            
            <img src="cytoscImport4.PNG" alt="importing node, edge, node, and edge attribute columns"/>
            <p>When you have selected your columns for import, click "OK" at the bottom...wait a bit, and voila! But this will look like a gargantuan tangle of square grids at first:</p>
            <img src="cytoscImport5.PNG" alt="first view of network on immport"/>
            <p>Notice the <strong>Table Panel</strong> at the bottom of the screen. You can toggle it to view Node data, Edge data, or (less usefully) Network data. I've toggled the Edge data view here because it displays information about my nodes and edges together. Try clicking on any line in the Node table or Edge table view, and see if you can highlight its corresponding node or edge in the view of the network in the bottom left of the screen. This feature in Cytoscape allows you to read and navigate your network by sorting and selecting your nodes in the table, and is a useful reminder that your network is something more than its graphical visualization.</p>

            <p>Okay, let's try to make a more legible graph. To begin, we might just look at Cytoscape's "Preferred Layout" feature, by clicking on the left-most icon that looks like a tiny network:</p>
            <img src="prefLayout.PNG" alt="Cytoscape's Preferred Layout feature"/> 
            <p>For all kinds of reasons, the layout that Cytoscape selected for me (a Prefuse Force-Directed Layout) is not really appropriate for my data. (You can read about Force Directed Layouts here: they're designed to be aesthetically pleasing by designing edges to behave like physical springs, obeying laws of attraction and repulsion, based on a node's degree of connectedness: less connected nodes are pushed to the peripheries, and highly connected nodes "spring" to the center. I am not a fan of this layout because my nodes seem buried inside each other: this does not seem very legible or useful to me. Let's explore some other options.</p>
